"Coimbatore: Slugfest between the ruling AIADMK and opposition DMK in Coimbatore intensified on Monday as deputy speaker of the state assembly Pollachi V Jayaraman and a host of AIADMK leaders launched a scathing attack on DMK president M K Stalin at a public meeting in Pollachi. Jayaraman said he was ready to quit politics if charges levelled against him and his family members by DMK in connection with Pollachi sexual assault case were proved. âStalin has been linking my family to the case. I dare him to furnish proof. If he comes out with evidence, I will quit politics forever. If he is unable to furnish proof, will Stalin step down from the post of DMK president?ââ Jayaraman asked. ``Let him take a week and respond,ââ Jayaraman added. Jayaraman said Stalin raked up the issue ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and has taken it up again when the state was gearing up for assembly polls. ``When I heard about the sexual assault on the girl, I was the one who spoke to the victim and gave her courage to lodge a police complaint. The victim had also released an audio message stating this,ââ Jayaraman said. ``Also, I was the first politician who spoke about the scandal in February 2019 demanding action against the culprits. But DMK is blaming me and my family,ââ Jayaraman said. The meeting, in which a host of AIADMK leaders, including B Valarmathi and S Gokula Indira, participated was organised a day after DMK held a protest led by M K Kanimozhi against the AIADMK for alleged attempts to protect the accused in the Pollachi sex scandal. The meeting replete with below the belt attacks against Stalin and M Karunanidhi was organised by the AIADMK womenâs wing to condemn Udhayanidhi Stalin for `denigrating womenâ and Stalin for giving party posts to DMK men accused of harassing women. Local administration minister S P Velumani, meanwhile, said action would be taken against all the accused in the Pollachi case irrespective of who they were. They demanded that DMK stop the false propaganda. While DMK is contemplating a series of protests, AIADMK partymen have vowed to hit back with counter protests. Last week too, after Stalin held a `makkal gram sabhaâ meeting in minister Velumaniâs Thondamuthur constituency, a protest was organised by the AIADMK within the next two days to counter the allegations. Stalinâs makkal sabha meeting in Thondamuthur was itself a response to police arresting DMK men elsewhere in Coimbatore for organising the gram sabhas earlier in the month. "
"Dynastic politics is the leitmotif as political sparring begins ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly election nears. Union home minister Amit Shah fired the first salvo at the DMK, but M K Stalin countered with a list of the BJPâs political families.When Stalinâs son Udhayanidhi started his poll campaign, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami again brought up the topic of dynastic politics. ""If members of a family get power and position in a party and government, family interest will get prioritised and public welfare will take a backseat. We, the AIADMK, prioritise welfare schemes for the people,"" said AIADMK Villupuram district secretary and minister C Ve Shanmugam. But the AIADMKâs party coordinator and deputy CM O Panneerselvam is also accused of promoting his son P Ravindhranath Kumar, who contested and won the Lok Sabha elections from their home turf of Theni.The DMK, for its part, is unperturbed by accusations that it is promoting dynastic politics. The party has been promoting Udhayanidhi Stalin and Kanimozhi as star campaigners and harking back to the ""golden rule"" of party and family patriarch Karunanidhi. ""Earlier dynastic politics was treated like a Columbus discovery. We have given enough replies. The sons of leaders, Sheikh, Mulayam, Biju, Devegowda and YSR have become chief ministers. Those with talent alone could rise and survive. People will take to great heights those showing real interest in politics, and ready to sacrifice life for public welfare,"" said DMK general secretary S Durai Murugan. The party MPs Dayanidhi Maran, Kalanidhi Veeraswamy, Goutham Sigamani, Tamizhachi Thangapandian and K M Kadhir Anand ride the popularity of families.The situation is not very different in the Congress TN unit. Last week the party put out a list of office bearers, vice-presidents, general secretaries and secretaries after a gap of seven years, and the prominent nominees were sons of former TNCC presidents, K V Thangkabalu, E V K S Elangovan, S Thirunavukkarasar and late Era Anbarasu for the general secretary post. Ironically, Sivaganga MP Karti, son offormer Union minister P Chidambaram hit out at the leadership for ""jumbo committees"" and said that none would have any authority. TNCC president K S Alagiri finds no fault with dynastic politics. ""In a family there is usually no shifting allegiances to other parties. The children try to follow in the footsteps of their elders. But postings are a recognition of the individualâs work. Capability and hard work decides rise in the ranks,"" he said. Last year following the death of MP H Vasanthakumar, his son Vijay Vasanth was appointed Congress general secretary. The young scion feels the barbs of nepotism are only valid if a person is undeserving. ""When sons of lawyers and doctors can take up their parentsâ profession, why should a politicianâs son be questioned? The acceptance of people is important. The party considers the individualâs strength before taking a call on appointments,"" said Vijay, who says he worked with his father and picked up political insights. The actor is also touted asthe Congress candidate for Kanyakumari LS bypoll when it takes place.Though there is no denying people have voted to power kin of politicians, family politics does carry a burden of bias. ""In parties like the BJP at the Centre or the AIADMK in the state, the top leaders do not have political heirs and so make an issue out of it. The fact also remains that in this era of political defection, loyalty also becomes a major concern. When Dheeran and Dalit R Ezhilmalai left the party at the crucial stage, PMK leader S Ramadoss was forced to bring in his son, Anbumani,"" said political analyst N Sathiya Murthy. It is a given that family members of many veterans across the political spectrum will seek poll tickets. In such a case, charges of dynastic politics will cancel out one another."
"Politically, what 2021 has in store for Kerala eludes definitive answers. But what's certain is that we will be witnessing the mother of all elections. The tenure of the Pinarayi Vijayan government is about to end in a few months. The ensuing assembly election, in all probability, would redefine the theories and myths that politicians and political observers have painstakingly constructed over the years to explain the peculiar dynamics of the state politics. What is new is the emergence of BJP as an alternative political force and its possible impact on the poll prospects of LDF and UDF. ``CPM is the only party that takes a principled stand against communal forces. The public resentment against the Modi government would reflect in favour of the LDF governmentââ, claims CPM politburo member M A Baby. He finds no reasons as to why people should vote against the Pinarayi government. ``Kerala is the only state where free treatment is given to Covid-19 patients. The fact that over 90 percent of Covid-19 patients were treated in government hospitals in the state signifies how pro-people the government is'', he added. But political observers do not agree with the theory of LDF maintaining a winning streak just because it managed to outperform others in the LSG election. ``The approach and voting pattern in local body, Assembly and Parliament elections are different in Kerala. Whether the UDF would be able to garner anti-government votes by idling is uncertain. But that doesnât mean that there is no resentment against the government. The gold smuggling and other cases would definitely have its impact on the electionââ, surmised political commentator Joseph Mathew. The emergence of BJP as a force to reckon with and Pinarayi Vijayanâs experiment with `freebiesâ politics are some new factors, the impact of which only time could prove, he said. The setback to UDF in the LSG election, believes Congress leader V D Satheesan MLA, is a temporary phenomenon. The UDF, he said, would resort to a newer mode of campaign in view of the Covid-19 restrictions and harness the anti-government votes to its favour. ``All allegations against the government are serious and it would reflect in the voting to Assembly electionââ, he said. According to him, CPM was playing opportunist politics and trying to divide people along communal lines. BJP state president K Surendran claims that the 2020 local body election has given BJP a much needed impetus and the NDA would emerge as a third political alternative with enough seats to decide who should form the next government. ``People can only vote for BJP-NDA candidates, if they really mean to cast their vote against Pinarayi Vijayan government. How can they vote for Congress which is an ally of CPM everywhere elseââ, he asks. He too accuses Vijayan for inciting communal sentiments with an eye on Xi'an votes. For former CPM leader and political analyst Appukkuttan Vallikkunnu, the 2021 election would be fought on grounds that were hitherto unknown to state polity. ``The Enforcement Directorate is unlikely to submit a final charge sheet in the gold smuggling and other cases before June. If itâs so, Pinayavi Vijayan would be in a relatively advantageous position. This could be part of understanding between CPM-BJP top brass. BJPâs prime objective is to decimate Congress and of course they would benefit from the Congressâ lossââ, he said, adding that the 2021 election would be hard to predict for all wrong reasons.

"When it comes to politics, our men in whites are in a different league. Some of them change the colours of their karai vettis with the ease of a batsman changing a willow. Some are deceptive spinners, some others masters of reverse swing. Those at the crease seldom play with a straight bat, but when it comes to modern-day cricket, all that matters is the score. TOI opens bids for the 2021 season of the Tamil Nadu Political League. Edappadi K Palaniswami | GREAT GRAFTERHe has been in the AIADMK team for a while, but nobody really noticed him scoring those ones and twos down the batting order. After the team owner made a shocking exit in December 2016, there was much turmoil, and the night watchman was suddenly out of the new managerâs favour. And in came EPS, still looking lame and lacklustre. The first year of his innings was sheer survival. From the second, he started middling, and by the third he drove, cut and hooked, sending the red cherry all over the boundary. While the team gets ready for the next match, the man is still at the crease, his willow moving like a Samurai sword. O Panneerselvam | NON-STRIKERHe was the night watchman during the crisis who soon found himself in a crisis. After much ruckus and wrangling, he is back in the team at number two, but he seldom gets to the batting crease. Waiting at the non-strikerâs end, OPS tried prodding his partner to rotate the strike, but that was not to be. He called for some cheeky singles, but the adamant striker wouldnât budge. Frustrated, he did plot to run out his partner, but realised he is the last man standing and if they lose a wicket, he wouldnât get to bat anyway. So OPS spends most of his time striking the handsome non-strikerâs pose, standing cross-feet with the bat handle resting on his back, exchanging polite pleasantries with the umpire who sports a grey beard. M K Stalin | CAPTAIN-IN-WAITINGHaving an influential father helped him get into the team early on in his career, but his rise has been gradual, and his present position at the top earned out of practice and perseverance. Once the vice-captain, the wait for the top slot has been excruciatingly long, as the captain refused to pass on the bat(on). Even after taking over the captaincy, Stalin has had to wait out as the opponent team survived a self-inflicted crisis in 2017 and the grafter flicked and glanced every overpitched delivery that came his way. Still padded up, he sits in the dugout, shadowed by K S Alagiri who canât wait to see the new captain in action, so he could run into the field with a change of bat or a bottle of water. Kamal Haasan | BITS-AND-PIECES MEDIUM PACERHe has come with the promise of sending the grafter back to the pavilion, but his practice match last year has been unimpressive. With a dismal strike rate in the national league, the left-arm medium pacerâs good performances have been confined to urban pitches. Working hard on his deliveries, Kamal has managed to tempt the batsmen to snick the mild outswingers, but the umpires have so far been unkind. As a player showing signs of perseverance, he is promising, but much of his results would depend on the teammates he ends up with. Will the leftie join hands with the mystery spinner? Thatâll be a match to watch! Thol Thirumavalavan | FIERY OUTFIELDERAs a player, his appeal in the gallery is limited to a stand, but when it comes to shouting for a leg before wicket, he is an asset for the team. Unlike the slinger, Thiruma has been fairly consistent in choosing his team and has partaken the spoils of the wins. Often fielding at the ropes, he has not been so much inside the circle, but the team captain knows this man can save some fours and take a few high catches. And whenever he does that, he runs into the team huddle for a pat on the back. Being at the boundary line, he engages in an occasional squabble with the spectators who cheer for the opposite team. Anbumani Ramadoss | AIMLESS SLINGERMost slingers are match-winners, but this one has the knack of getting into the losing team, season after season. Academically trained in clinical approaches and coached in ground tactics by his dad, Anbu couldâve been an asset to any team if only he wouldnât overestimate himself and try to be the captain. One moment he looks composed and confident at the slips, the other he gives in to the temptation to sledge. After new variations failed, he has gone back to the old trick of quota yorker, but the length and movement donât fetch wickets when the cherry goes far outside the leg stump. And, at times, the slinger appears to be chucking. K Vijayakant | RETIRED HURTHe made a brave debut in 2006. Attempting a one-man show, Vijayakant might not have won, but he did prove his potential to be a limited utility player in any team. In the next match, the team chemistry didnât work, and he was soon reduced to a lower-order batsman. Low on stamina, he was getting injured too often, and hit by repeated bouncers, now he sits in the pavilion. His better half as the concussion sub has been no match, and her delusions of grandeur may rub the team manager up the wrong way, hastening the captainâs exit from the ground. L Murugan | SILLY POINTBrought in to lead a struggling B team that pretends to be the A team in the national league, his strategies have so far been ineffective in reviving the teamâs prospects. When the going got tough, Murugan didnât hesitate to be at loggerheads with captain EPS. And that hasnât helped. As he went around the field in what he called a âVel runâ, the captain told him his position: Silly point. So there he stands, spear-like and dreaming of the elusive victory: next time if not this. The problem with the pondering pose is that the ball slips through the gap between his legs. "
"NEW DELHI: While India has not been a factor or played a role in the current phase of political turbulence in Nepal, political and government sources here believe Nepal should take the democratic route, which in this case would mean elections, to resolve the impasse. Itâs also becoming clear that although China may have failed in its mission in Nepal for the present, Chinese involvement in Nepali politics has grown deep enough in the past few years to ensure that all shades of political opinion can be influenced by China. All political analysts in Kathmandu agree that PM K P Sharma Oli currently holds most of the cards â on dissolution of the House, on elections etc. How he will play those cards, whether with the help of China or India, remains to be seen. Oli can play the nationalist card or the Hindu card at will. He also is the biggest investment by China in Nepali politics. Sources in Kathmandu say that China has not yet given up the game. Having sponsored many political leaders in Nepal, Chinaâs influence in fairly deep and wide. Indiaâs role currently is restricted to ensuring that New Delhi is not a factor in the current turbulence or even in the forthcoming election campaign. A formal split in the NCP is yet to be announced, but sources say, backroom machinations are on in full swing. They point to several evolving scenarios in Nepal. First, the split would impact the election campaigns of the factions. The election commission would have to decide on who gets the NCP election symbol, which could be a tussle. It could end up with both factions getting different symbols. Second, sources say the question of dissolution of Parliament may have to be decided by the Supreme Court. In addition, they say, Oli could drag the current state beyond May to November before actual elections are held. If there is a question about having a neutral party as interim PM, the chief justice could be acting PM, which could throw up a whole new set of constitutional and political challenges. "
"KOLKATA: BJP national vice president Mukul Roy on Friday blamed the Trinamool Congress of slapping multiple false cases against the saffron party leaders who had earlier quit TMC and charged it of pursuing vindictive politics against political opponents. Roy told reporters here that when he or Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh were in the TMC fold there were no cases against them. ""But ever since Arjun and I joined BJP, 55 cases were slapped against me and over 65 against him (Singh). Arjun's son too has been charged with false cases after he joined politics,"" Roy told newspersons here. ""This (TMC) is a vindictive government which will be defeated in the next assembly election,"" he said. Singh was present at the interaction. To a question Roy welcomed the Supreme Court order on Friday granting interim protection to five BJP leaders, including himself, Singh and Kailash Vijayvargiya in criminal cases lodged against them in West Bengal and directing the state police not to take any coercive action. ""We hail the Supreme Court order, We know truth will prevail,"" he said. Welcoming several panchayat members from Paschim Medinipur district who switched over from TMC to BJP, Roy said many of them are from the minority community. ""It shows people of different communities and faiths are uniting in Bengal under BJP to remove the undemocratic TMC government."" He claimed that the ruling TMC will not be able to secure more than 100 out of the total 295 seats in the 2021 state polls with its leaders at different levels and ordinary activists quitting the party in droves. He, however, did not want to comment if Barrackpore MLA Silbhadra Dutta, who quit TMC Friday will join BJP. Asked to comment on reservations expressed by Asansol MP and Union Minister Babul Supriyo about TMC MLA and former chief of Asansol Municipal Corporation joining the BJP, Roy wondered why the media highlighted such issues and hinted it was not a serious one.

"AMRITSAR: The long drawn out farmersâ agitation, which has caught the attention of the common public, has also inspired many frontrunner leaders to nurture political ambitions and ride the âpopularity waveâ to victory in the assembly elections, if fielded by any party. After planning to form their own political outfit, a group of farmer leaders, who held a few rounds of meetings with some âinvestorsâ and Akali dissidents, presented a âreport cardâ of their present situation to a senior Congress leader in his house on Tuesday. After holding a meeting with the enthusiasts, a Congress leader who didnât wish to be named, said the situation was not very encouraging or conducive but a few farmer leaders were nurturing ambitions. âThe farmers are already divided into 32 groups. Out of these, 12 groups do not even enjoy the support of 200 persons each, yet they have managed to secure a seat while holding deliberations with government. The remaining 10 groups of farmers have followers ranging from 4,000 to 7,000 for each faction,â he said. State president, Jamhuri Kisan Sabha (JKS) Satnam Singh Ajnala said, âFarmer leaders are not thinking of forming any political party but people are approaching us with proposals. All this depends on the victory of the struggle in Delhi.â He did not rule out the possibility of the formation of a political front. Stating that in past, JKS had been contesting elections in Punjab, he said so far, the âSanyukat Kisan Morchaâ or conglomerate of 32 farmer organisations, had not explored the possibility of formation of a political party to contest the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab. However, Gurbachan Singh Chaba of Kisan Mazdur Sangarash Committee (KMSC) said, âWe are not interested in politics, if we indulge in politics then who will fight with the government?â Sources also said that a group of enthusiasts were going to Delhi to explore possibilities with AAPâs senior leadership.

"Tuticorin: Indu Makkal Katchi (IMK) will strive hard for the victory of the spiritual politics alliance in all the 234 assembly segments in the state in the assembly elections, its founder Arjun Sampath has said. âSpiritual politics will win. Rajinikanth should win,â he told reporters in Tuticorin on Sunday after taking part in special prayers for the victory of the political party to be floated by the superstar. âModi for Centre and Rajini for the state is our slogan,â he said adding that the political scenario has changed in the state and there will be a change in alliances in January. He said spiritual politics has been well received by people in Tamil Nadu who have been long waiting for a replacement for Dravidian politics. IMK will extend unconditional support to Rajinikanth who has brought political revolution in the state, he added.tnn "

"Ahmedabad: In a political drama, Congress councillors, led by Dariapur MLA Gyasuddin Shaikh, held the âinaugurationâ ceremony of the Lala Kaka Hall in Shahpur on Saturday. The inauguration was done a couple of hours before the official inauguration by mayor Bipal Patel was scheduled. Congress said that the facility was ready but the ruling party was waiting for appointments from ministers and hence it was delaying the inauguration. âPeople of the area need the facility for utilization as the marriage season is on,â said a leader. The leaders even cut the ribbon which was put up for inauguration by the mayor. However, the AMC officials from the zone said the inauguration was decided in advance and even the hall was readied for the inauguration by the mayor at 4pm. BJP leaders termed the Congressâ act as a political drama aimed at the local body elections scheduled early next year. The ruling party had on Friday fixed the charges for the hall and the same was approved by the board on Saturday. With the mayorâs term getting over on Sunday, the mayor went on a inauguration spree on Saturday with the opening of water distribution centres in Kankaria and Chadlodia and community centres in Shahpur and Vastrapur. More inauguration are scheduled for Sunday. "
"Nashik: Former chief minster and leader of opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday accused both Shiv Sena and Congress of playing politics over the issue of renaming Aurangabad to Sambhaji Nagar. âShiv Sena is constantly pledging to rename Aurangabad to keep its vote bank intact and on the other hand the Congress is opposing the renaming of Aurangabad since it is also keen to retain its vote bank,â Fadnavis, who was on a dayâs visit to Nashik, said. âAs a government you have the right to rename the city, but on that front the chief minister is not saying anything. There is a complete covert understanding between the ruling coalition partners on the issue. These two parties will continue to hoodwink the voters of Aurangabad on this important issue,â Fadnavis said. The former chief minister was in Nashik city for unveiling a book (Nana Nawale) written on the life of a social worker Sukhadev aka Nana Nawale following which he attended a couple of other programmes. Responding to a question on allegations on NCP leader and social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, Fadnavis said, âThere should be a transparent and honest investigations into the allegations made by the woman against Munde.â "
"For 60-year-old Ra Arjunamurthy, it was ""spiritual politics"" that drew him to Rajinikanth. After being associated with âMurasoliâ Maran for more than seven years, he was the brain behind a Near Field Communication venture Yeldi Softcom. He now has the onerous task of getting the political infrastructure ready in 29 days for the launch of Rajinikanthâs party. He shares his thoughts with TOI. Excerpts:Q: What made you want to work with Rajinikanth?His thoughts of spiritual politics. Now people get confused about this. Spiritualism brings with it responsibility and personal hygiene. Q: What is your role in his party?I am the chief convenor of the party. âThalaivarâ has some film shootings to be completed. We must get everything ready for the political party, starting with its registration. My role will be to get it done on behalf of him. Simply put: I have to put in place a system, politically, statutorily and technologically in less than a month. Q: But you were with the BJP as its head of intellectual cell.I resigned this morning [Thursday] and my resignation has been accepted too. If you say I was with the BJP then you should also look at the fact that I was associated with âMurasoliâ Maran for seven years. Does that mean I was a DMK man in the BJP? I hope that answers. We are now working at creating a paradigm shift in state politics. The BJP is a national party, but in Tamil Nadu one needs a popularity base with a clear focus. Please show me one person other than âThalaivarâ who ticks those boxes. We will promise that there would be no thuggery in what we do. Even today, âThalaivarâ is friends with EPS and Stalin. Isnât that different? Q: Social media is abuzz with comments that you are a BJP man in Rajniâs party?People can say what they want. I was doing my business. A spiritual calling from my Guruji in Theni brought me to politics. To me politics is a tool to uplift downtrodden people. For example at the BJP the two projects that I was associated with, Kodi Ozhi (a solar powered lamp for every flag post) and livelihood improvement in slums, were a success. These two also brought me closer to âThalaivarâ who wants to ride the technology wave for upliftment. Q: How would you go about it?With just four months we have to match the political infrastructure of the established parties. This is possible only with technology. My role is to bring various tech tools and build the technology architecture of the party which will help reach every nook and corner of the state in the shortest period of time.Q: Can you share some more details?While we are still getting into it. For instance, we have already completed booth-level planning for the party. We have the data, people profiles and I have to create the blueprint to use that data. We must create an analytical engine which will help in spreading the word about the partyâs ideology. One of the priorities of the party is to reduce unemployment in the state. Q: Why was there so much delay in the announcement?There is no delay. âThalaivarâ needed time to take a call. It is part of the process. His style is to look deeper into everything and analyse. He took the call and we are here."
"NAGPUR: Manisha Dhawde, the deputy mayor-elect, was elected as a corporator for the first time in 2017 from Prabhag 31. She is the sixth member of her family to be elected a corporator. She will take charge as deputy mayor of city on January 7. Apart from her mother-in-law Vimaltai Dhawde, four other family members -- Prabhakar Dhawde, Sindhutai Dhawde, Shankar Dhawde and Anil Dhawdeâ had served as corporators from the east Nagpur area. According to her, the elders in the family groomed her into politics. Dhawde, who is shy and prefers to keep a low profile, holds a masters degree in history and Marathi. Besides, she also possesses B.Ed degree. Before entering active politics in 2017, Dhawde used to conduct coaching classes. Her husband Ashish Dhawde is a civil contractor and now helps her attend to civic issues in her constituency. Speaking to TOI, Dhawde said she was not expecting the coveted post so soon in her political career of just four years. âI am very much grateful to the party for giving me such a big responsibility and will do my level best to serve the city,â she said.

"CHENNAI: The 7.5% quota in MBBS/BDS seats for government school students in Tamil Nadu epitomises competitive welfarism that has come to define the Dravidian party politics in the state. The ruling AIADMK or the DMK have been in power since 1967. They see eye-to-eye only in such matters as reservation, Cauvery river water sharing and Sri Lankan Tamils issue. In tune with this trend, the one-upmanship over 7.5% quota politics saw neat conception of the idea and its equally neat implementation. That the entire fee of the students will be borne by the DMK or the government, or both, has further sweetened the deal. Read the entire story on TOI+Dravidian welfarism - just what the doctor ordered"
"SOUTH 24 PARGANAS: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Abhishek Banerjee, who is also state chief minister Mamata Banerjee's nephew, on Sunday challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over dynastic politics and said he will quit happily if the latter brings a law mandating only one member from a family should stay in a particular political party. Addressing a public meeting in Diamond Harbour, Abhishek Banerjee said, ""I will leave politics in 24 hours. Those who are talking about the family system have five members each of their families in politics. BJP leaders like Mukul Roy, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Suvendu Adhikari and Rajnath Singh have other members of their families in prominent position."" He further urged the Prime Minister to bring a Bill in Parliament mandating only one person from a family in a particular political party. ""There will be only Mamata Banerjee from our family in politics if you (BJP) ensure that there would be only one member of a family in politics. Can you accept this challenge? I request Prime Minister to bring a Bill in the Parliament allowing only one member of a family in politics,"" said the TMC leader. In its political rallies ahead of the assembly polls in Bengal, BJP has been attacking heavily Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek over dynastic politics terming the duo as 'pisi-bhaipo'. The newly-inducted BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari had many times called TMC as a 'private limited company' of Mamata and Abhishek. Elections for 294 assembly seats in West Bengal are slated to take place later this year. "
"Dehradun: Despite claims by officials from the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) that political parties are being penalised for placing banners and posters on lampposts and public walls, the menace continues unabated in the city. In the recent such instance, scores of birthday greeting banners were put up on Sunday by the supporters of Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi. The posters, say observers, are in blatant violation of rules as the Prevention of Defacement of Public Property Act, 2003 prevents âunsystematic public display of political hoardings, posters, and banners.â The Act was passed by the ND Tiwari government in Uttarakhand but is rarely being enforced as political partries flout it with impunity. As a result, posters can be seen plastered all over the city â even on road signs and direction pointers, causing inconvenience to the people new to the city and tourists. Ramesh Singh, a resident of Jogiwala area, said, âThe political posters put up in our area have even covered private boards of shopkeepers and are a big eyesore .â Sanjeev Gothalwal, another resident said, âThe authorities should ensure that either these posters are taken down as soon as they are put up or penalise those putting them up. Since many of the posters are put up on public property and even on road signs, they are a big nuisance.â When TOI tried to contact Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama on the issue, he was unavailable even after repeated attempts.

"Ahmedabad: City police chief Sanjay Srivastava has instructed cops not to be confrontational with people who flout corona norms, especially the mask rule, and to fine offenders in line with the regulations. Srivastava issued the directions on Saturday during a crime conference involving inspectors and IPS officers. âHe also instructed us to avoid arguments with the violators and to be polite with them,â said a top police source. A senior police official said Srivastava noted that police have made a good impression on the public during the pandemic. âNow, we have been told to work harder to retain the image,â the official said. According to police sources, Srivastava also asked officers to be strict in dealing with land-grabbers and that they would be briefed on the new law soon. "
"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth has asked fans not to push him any further to rethink about his decision not to enter electoral politics by holding rallies. ""Do not push me to rethink my decision not to enter electoral politics by holding rallies. I have clearly said in my statement, why I am not entering electoral politics,"" actor Rajinikanth tweeted on Monday morning. Rajinikanth's tweet comes a day after a section of his fans held a peaceful rally at Valluvar Kottam in the city to urge him to take a relook at his earlier decision not to enter electoral politics. https://t.co/NVExYcjxN9— Rajinikanth (@rajinikanth) 1610343496000In a statement on December 29, 2020, Rajinikanth had said he is unable to launch his party and enter electoral politics citing his health condition. Though initially shocked by his decision, a majority of his fans and Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) members grudgingly accepted the actor's decision, since it was based on his health condition. Rajinikanth also expressed his anguish that some fans along with some expelled members of RMM came together to hold a rally on Sunday. It was against the decision of RMM, he said. While expressing his displeasure over attempts to hold such rallies to push further, Rajinikanth felt happy with the way the Sunday rally was organised without troubling the public. "
"THRISSUR: Seeking to reach out to Christians ahead of the Kerala assembly polls, the BJP on Friday alleged that the people belonging to the second largest minority community and the Hindus in the state were victims of vote-bank politics. Such politics, the saffron party said, is being played out by the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-led LDF.  ""The Christians and the people belonging to the majority community in Kerala are equally worried. They are the victims of the vote-bank politics based on religious communalism. The BJP will try to address this problem,"" BJP state president K Surendran said at the party's state committee meeting held here. His statement comes a week after three cardinals of Roman Catholic Church, including two top priests from Kerala, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, raising issues being faced by the Christian faithfuls. The issues included the one on disparities in distribution of minority funds and reservation to Dalit Christians. Earlier, the state BJP and Sangh Parivar outfits had backed the influential Syro-Malabar Church when it kicked up a debate over the alleged incidents of 'love jihad'. Against the backdrop of central agencies' investigation into the smuggling of gold and currencies allegedly through diplomatic channels, Surendran said the party would make corruption as the main plank of its campaign for the assembly polls. He hinted that the central agencies' probe is centred around the chief minister, four ministers and the assembly speaker and their role would be revealed during the investigation. Launching an attack on the state government over corruption, Surendran alleged that the state protocol department had provided special consideration for some notorious foreign citizens and those accused of smuggling of gold and dollar. The state is in the grip of corrupt politicians, Surendran alleged. The BJP also attacked the Congress-led UDF over the issue of corruption. Referring to the elevation of former chief minister Oommen Chandy as the leader of UDF's election campaign, he said with this decision of the Congress high command, people have got an opportunity to discuss corruption during the previous Congress-led government. Now, the people have an opportunity to compare the corruption during the previous UDF government and the present LDF government, he said. Claiming that the BJP could perform well in the recently held civic polls, he said the party-led NDA has increased its vote base and that BJP is the one and only party which can now take on the ruling CPI(M). In his address, BJP state in-charge C P Radhakrishnan said the party is fighting for capturing power in the Communist-ruled state. If the BJP could oust the CPI(M) from power in Tripura, the same would happen in Kerala too, he said.  Referring to the stand of the state government on Sabarimala women's entry issue, Radhakrishnan alleged that the CPI(M) was trying to destroy the culture and the customs of the state. Meanwhile, BJP state vice-president Sobha Surendran, who had reportedly complained to the party's central leadership about the functioning style of the state leadership, skipped the state committee meeting convened to discuss the matters related to the assembly polls.

"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth's associate Ra Arjunamurthy on Thursday said he would soon launch a new political party that would work towards ushering in the much-needed change on the political and governance front in Tamil Nadu. The party would be launched soon, he said in a statement. But he did not name the party too. ""A change takes place in Tamil Nadu once in 60 years. I strongly believe we are at the stage now. Fortunately, the state is set to face assembly election, and we should utilize the opportunity,"" Arjunamurthy said. The new party will work for the welfare of the state and the safety of women among others. ""I have plans to tap the potential of youngsters, who account for a sizeable section of the population,"" he said. "
"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth's associate Ra Arjunamurthy, who was introduced by the actor as chief coordinator of Rajini Makkal Mandram in December last year, is set to announce a new political initiative on Thursday. âEven though Rajinikanth could not launch his political party due to his health condition, he remains my leader. Having been introduced by him to render my service in Tamil Nadu, I feel the need to fulfill his thoughts to usher in a change in politics and governance,â Arjunamurthy said in a statement on Wednesday. Since Rajinikanth, for the present, has the responsibility to fulfill his commercial commitments in the film industry, Arjunamurthy said he was constrained from using either the name or the image of the actor in this political initiative. The focus will be to usher in the much-needed change in the assembly election in 2021, he said. "
"WASHINGTON: The Department of Homeland Security issued a national terrorism bulletin Wednesday warning of the potential for lingering violence from people motivated by anti-government sentiment after President Joe Biden's election, suggesting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol may embolden extremists and set the stage for additional attacks. The department did not cite a specific threat, but pointed to ""a heightened threat environment across the United States'' that it believes ""will persist'' for weeks after Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. ""Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,'' the bulletin said. It did not mention any ideological or political affiliation, while noting the potential for violence from ""a broad range of ideologically-motivated actors.'' It is not uncommon for the federal government to warn local law enforcement through bulletins and advisories about the prospect for violence tied to a particular date or event, such as July 4. But this particular bulletin, issued through the the department's National Terrorism Advisory System, is notable because it effectively places the Biden administration into the politically charged debate over how to describe or characterize acts motivated by political ideology and suggests that it sees violence aimed at overturning the election as akin to terrorism. The wording of the single-page document suggests that national security officials see a connective thread between recent violence over the last year motivated by anti-government grievances, whether over COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results or police use of force. It also singles out racially motivated acts of violence such as the 2019 rampage targeting Hispanics in Texas, as well as the threat posed by extremists motivated by foreign terrorist organizations. The alert comes at a tense time after the riot at the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were seeking to overturn the presidential election. DHS also noted violent riots in ""recent days,'' an apparent reference to events in Portland, Oregon, linked to anarchist groups. The alert was issued by acting Homeland Security Secretary David Pekoske. Biden's nominee for the Cabinet post, Alejandro Mayorkas, has not been confirmed by the Senate. Two former homeland security secretaries, Michael Chertoff and Janet Napolitano, called on the Senate to confirm Mayorkas so he can start working with the FBI and other agencies and deal with the threat posed by domestic extremists, among other issues. Chertoff, who served under President George W. Bush, said in a conference call with reporters that attacks by far-right, domestic extremists are not new but that deaths attributed to them in recent years in the US have exceeded those linked to jihadists such as al-Qaida. ""We have to be candid and face what the real risk is,'' he said. "
"AMETHI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said the relationship with Amethi is not political but that of a family, and family ties can never be weakened. She was addressing party workers in Jamo block here. ""The relationship with Amethi is not political, it is that of home and family. It is an old relationship, and a strong one. The relationship, which we had with the people of Amethi, the same is intact today, and it will be the same in future,"" Gandhi said. She told party workers that ""building the organisation is the first priority of all of us"". Pradeep Singhal, president of the district unit of the party, said the Congress general secretary also discussed the contentious farm laws enacted by the Centre last year. ""Priyanka Gandhi discussed the farm laws, and said that the 'anti-farmer' laws are not only dangerous for the peasants, but for the entire country. She asserted that the government was not giving any attention towards the farmers protesting at the Delhi borders for the past two months against the laws. ""She also talked about various steps taken in the interest of farmers in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and others,"" he said. Singhal said Gandhi also sought information about problems faced by the people of Amethi. ""The Congress general secretary noted that the party had to be strengthened till the booth level, and asked the party workers to reach out to the poor, farmers, small traders and the helpless,"" he added.

"Anybody who follows US elections knows that the Democrats have an advantage in cities and Republicans in rural areas. But just how complete the cleavage between these two worlds in America is revealed by analyzing data for counties in the just concluded presidential polls, for which votes are still not fully counted. Joe Biden won 38 of the 40 counties in which there were more than 500,000 votes cast. The only ones in which Donald Trump won were Nassau and Suffolk counties in his home state of New York. In these 40 counties, which are all obviously in cities, Bidenâs vote share was nearly 63% and Trumpâs share under 36%.   At the other end of the spectrum, in counties with less than 10,000 votes cast, Biden could win just 102 of the 1,335 or about one in every 13. Trump won the remaining 1,233. In counties of this size, Trumpâs vote share of nearly 71% dwarfed Bidenâs share of under 28%.   As the graphic shows, as the size of the counties goes up, the proportion of them won by Biden as well as his vote share progressively declines while Trumpâs rises steadily. This pattern holds irrespective of whether the county is in a state won by Biden or one won by Trump. In Maryland, for instance, a state as staunchly Democratic as any, of the 16 counties where less than 100,000 votes were cast, Biden won only two. This despite the fact that his vote share in the state as a whole was 63%. Similarly, in the states won by Trump in these elections, Biden won 22 of the 25 largest counties. That includes Jefferson county in Kentucky, a state in which Trumpâs vote share was 62% or Marion county in Tennessee, a state where Trump won 61% of the votes. The data used here is incomplete since states are still counting. However, it covers nearly 144 million votes across 47 states and the District of Columbia. County level data for Maine, Massachusetts and Mississippi was not available. Indiana and Illinois too did not have data for a few counties. Apart from counties, the data includes districts in Alaska, which does not have counties as well as independent cities in states like Virginia, Nevada and Maryland. "
"HOWRAH: Two persons, including a bystander, were injured in a clash between Trinamool and BJP supporters in Howrahâs Liluah on Saturday morning as gunshots and bomb blasts shook the area. In Titagarh, a Trinamool activist, Rumani Khan (48), reportedly a close aide of a former Trinamool councillor, was shot dead in front of his family on Saturday evening. The trouble in Howrah was reported a day after Trinamool formally expelled Bally MLA Vaishali Dalmiya from its ranks. Liluah, which is within the Bally assembly constituency, bore the brunt of the violence. The unrest spilled onto the adjoining GT Road, bringing traffic to a standstill and forcing shops to shut down. Those on the rampage, vandalized seven bikes parked along GT Road and even set a two-wheeler on fire. One of the injured â Promode Dubey, who is reportedly a BJP worker â sustained a bullet wound to his foot. The bystander, Ashok Rai, was hit by bomb splinters. Cops said four persons had been arrested for the Liluah violence. However, no arrest had been made till late evening for Khanâs murder. According to locals, the incident occurred around 6.30pm while the victim Rumani Khan(48), who is in the construction business, was resting in his house in Titagarhâs Goalapara. âThree masked youths stormed into the room and fired twice at him and fled. Khanâs daughter was injured. "
"Patna: The Bihar governmentâs decision to take action against any individual or organisation if they make âobjectionable, inappropriate or misleadingâ comments on social media against the state government, its ministers or government officers, has sparked a political storm in the state. The directive issued by the state policeâs economic offences unit (EoU) has drawn the ire of the opposition parties, which have strongly condemned the order calling it a violation of the constitutional right to freedom of speech. The main opposition RJD launched a frontal attack on the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government with the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav saying the CM was following in the footsteps of Hitler. Similar reactions came from Congress and other opposition parties. âCM Nitish Kumar has forgotten that democracy started from Bihar and freedom of expression is a fundamental right. If the government, ministers or officials are indulging in corruption why shouldnât people raise it? Why is he scared of a democratic exercise? If anyone criticises the state government, its schemes or fault in their execution, what is wrong in it? Why is Nitish Kumar Ji scared so much?â Tejashwi told reporters, adding the government should withdraw the order immediately. Tejashwi went on to dare Nitish to arrest him as he accused the government of protecting liquor smugglers. On Thursday, the EOUâs additional director-general, Nayyar Hasnain Khan, had issued a letter to all government departments asking them to inform the EOU if they come across any such report so that necessary legal action taken against such persons or entities. The letter says continuous information is being received about some people or organisations that are involved in making âobjectionable, inappropriate or misleadingâ comments against the government, ministers, MPs, MLAs and government officers. âThis is against the law and falls under the category of cybercrime. For such acts, it seems proper to take legal action against such persons or organisations. Notably, EOU is the nodal agency for cybercrimes in the state,â the letter issued by Khan read. Khan told TOI over the phone on Friday that the letter has been completely misinterpreted as an attempt to curb freedom of speech. âOf late, misuse of social media has increased. It is being used with impunity to harm dignitaries and government officials by posting abusive or misleading contents which might even affect tranquillity and peace. Common people approach police but government authorities either ignore such incidents or donât have knowledge that EOU handles such issues categorised as cybercrime,â Khan said. He further said that the letter is aimed to make them aware of approaching EOU as itâs the only nodal wing of the state police that can interact with social media companies in cybercrime cases. âIt has been only suggested that any such incident be brought to EOUâs light so that it may inquire into the matter and take action if found to be a cognizable offence,â the ADG said. However, the Opposition led an all-out attack on the government over the letter. âThis letter would not have been issued without the instruction of the CM. He wants to snatch the fundamental rights of the people,â said Congress Legislative Party leader Ajit Sharma. AIMIM state president and MLA Akhtarul Iman said such steps taken by any wing working under the government was dangerous to democracy. âAnyone can criticize the government for their failure. But that does not mean action should be taken against them. Media of any kind, print, electronic or social media should have the freedom,â Iman said. The ruling NDA leaders, however, defended the governmentâs order. BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said those writing correct news or information should not be worried. âWhy should anyone be afraid if one is not posting anything wrong,â said Dr Jaiswal. JD (U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said everyone had the right to express, but the use of defamatory language or wrong information is not allowed. Neeraj hit back at Tejashwi saying the latter had no idea about constitutional rights and the letter written by the ADG never talked about intruding on anyoneâs rights. âAs far as the comparison with Hitler is concerned, Tejashwi is not aware of the fact that during Hitlerâs time there was no democracy, but we are living in a democratic country,â he said.

"PATNA: Cutting across party lines, netas in Bihar on Thursday said they would come forward and get themselves vaccinated for Covid-19 in the second phase in order to build confidence among common people. So far, the stateâs average vaccination has been nearly 55% as many healthcare workers are avoiding taking shots. BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said if any policy is made by the government regarding public representatives taking the vaccine shots, he will be the first one to do so. âOur MPs, MLAs and all leaders are ready to get vaccinated,â he said. JD(U) national secretary general and spokesperson K C Tyagi, said, âI have heard that even the PM Narendra Modi is willing to get vaccinated in the second phase. This will remove all confusions. All leaders above 50 years should take the jab.â Congress and RJD leaders also said they would not hesitate in getting vaccine shots. Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha said public representatives should come fowrad to build confidence among people. RJD state spokesperson Jagdanand Singh too said there is no harm in taking the vaccine. A health department official, however, said the Centre has so far not issued any guideline for the vaccination of public representatives above 50 years of age in the second phase. "
"BANGKOK: An ultra royalist group in Thailand launched a new political party on Wednesday to defend King Maha Vajiralongkorn, amid unprecedented calls for reform of the monarchy by a youth-led protest movement. The ""Thai Pakdee"" (Loyal Thai) party is an offshoot of a royalist group of the same name formed last August to counter street demonstrations with rallies in support of the king. Veteran politician Warong Dechgitvigrom will lead the new party, which he said will fight political groups whose true intention was to topple the monarchy. ""Before we defend ... today we declare war, we will fight to protect the monarchy,"" Warong told a news conference. Leaders of the protest movement have rejected allegations that toppling the monarchy is their goal and have repeatedly said they want to make the institution more compatible with democracy. Warong said the prominent opposition party, Move Forward, and its associated Progressive Movement group would be his party's political rivals, as well as the youth-led groups that he called ""the three-fingers mob"", referring to the ""Hunger Games"" salute they use in their campaign. In a statement Warong said his party did not have support of any particular groups or businesses and would belong to the people. He did not name any other members, but said the election commission had been notified of its formation and executives would be selected soon. Progressive politician Piyabutr Saengkanokkul warned, however, that the new party risked associating the monarchy with domestic politics. ""The formation of a party that advocates the protection of the monarchy, whether by good intention or for destroying others, could only bring the monarchy into the political sphere,"" Piyabutr said on his official Twitter account.

"CARACAS: With the clock winding down on his term, US President Donald Trump shielded tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants from deportation Tuesday night, rewarding Venezuelan exiles who have been among his most loyal supporters and who fear losing the same privileged access to the White House during the Biden administration.  Trump signed an executive order deferring for 18 months the removal of more than 145,000 Venezuelans who were at risk of being sent back to their crisis-wracked homeland. He cited the ""deteriorative condition"" within Venezuela that constitutes a national security threat as the basis for his decision.  ""America remains a beacon of hope and freedom for many, and now eligible Venezuelan nationals in the U.S. will receive much-needed temporary immigration relief,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida, said in a statement praising the decision.  The last-minute reprieve - in sharp contrast to Trump's hardline immigration policies the past four years - capped a busy final day in office that also saw Trump issue a sweeping new round of financial sanctions targeting the alleged front man of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and tighten controls to keep spying technology out of the hands of the Venezuelan military.  But ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration Wednesday, far greater attention was focused on the president-elect's choice to be secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who during his U.S. Senate confirmation hearing in Washington showed continued support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido.  Blinken, in his first comments on Venezuela, said he would continue recognizing Guaido as Venezuela's interim president and indicated he has no illusions of an eventual dialogue with Maduro, who he called a ""brutal dictator.""  Still, the veteran diplomat expressed frustration with the results of current U.S. approach, which hasn't shaken Maduro's grip on power or led to free and fair elections. He said there is room for fine tuning sanctions and better coordination with allied nations to restore democracy to the crisis-stricken South American nation.  ""The hard part is that for all these efforts, which I support, we obviously have not gotten the results that we need,"" Blinken said.  The Trump administration was the first of now more than 50 countries in the world to recognize Guaido as Venezuela's president shortly after the young lawmaker rose up to challenge Maduro's rule two years ago. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo spoke Monday by phone with Guaido, expressing his ""personal respect and appreciation"" to the opposition leader for his ""commitment to the cause of freedom,"" the State Department said in a statement.  Venezuela, a once wealthy oil-producing nation, has fallen into economic and political crisis in recent years that has seen a flood of more than 5 million residents flee a breakdown in public services and shortages including a lack of running water, electricity and gasoline.  Most have migrated to other parts of Latin America. But an estimated 350,000 are believed to reside in the U.S., and about 146,000 of them have no legal status, according to the Center for Migration Studies in New York.  More than 700 Venezuelans have been removed from the U.S. since 2018, while 11,000 more are under deportation proceedings, according to the TRAC immigration data base of Syracuse University.  For years, Venezuelans, with bipartisan support, have been clamoring for so-called temporary protected status to no effect as Trump has tried to end the program for migrants from six other countries, including Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador.  Trump's order provides similar protections, including protection from deportation and the right to work, but was still met by resistance by some Democrats who want Biden to introduce legislation providing additional safeguards.  ""Our community will not be fooled and used for political games anymore,"" said Leopoldo Martinez, the first Venezuela-born member of the Democratic National Committee.  In the latest round of sanctions trying to pressure Maduro out, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on three individuals, 14 businesses and six ships. All are accused of helping the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA evade earlier U.S. sanctions designed to stop the president from profiting from crude sales.  The sanctions target people and businesses linked to Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman who U.S. officials say is the front man for Maduro responsible for everything from the importation of food to the export of the nation's crude. Saab was arrested on a U.S. warrant last year in the African nation of Cape Verde on what Maduro says was an official mission to Iran to purchase supplies. He is now fighting extradition to Miami, where he faces corruption charges.  Maduro's government blasted the sanctions as another act of ""imperialist aggression"" aimed at destroying Venezuela's ability to meet its own needs through oil sales after four years of attacks from the Trump administration.  The U.S. Department of Commerce also announced measures Tuesday to block U.S. technology from being used by military intelligence in nations including China, Cuba, Russia and Venezuela.  Such stiff measures have become an almost routine feature of the outgoing administration's hardline approach to Venezuela, which has proven popular with exile Latino voters in Florida. "
"ROME: Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took office with no political experience but has proved remarkably adept at staying in power -- at least so far. The once obscure law professor has been at the helm of two governments of different political persuasions since 2018, the latter dominated by a deadly pandemic and a record recession. ""I think he has rather uncommon qualities ... otherwise he would not have got to where he is, and above all stayed there, despite all odds,"" remarked political journalist Francesco Bei. The 56-year-old Conte is this week trying to keep his job following the exit from the ruling coalition of ex-premier Matteo Renzi's Italia Viva party. Renzi had for weeks lambasted Conte for his handling of the pandemic, which has claimed more than 82,000 lives in Italy and devastated the economy. But Conte has enjoyed approval ratings topping 60 percent since the pandemic began, while his approach of locking down Italy -- after some hesitations -- was followed by governments across Europe. Conte was dubbed ""Mr Nobody"" when he was appointed in 2018 to take over a fractious coalition comprising the initially anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and Matteo Salvini's far-right League. He introduced himself as ""the people's advocate"", and said he was happy to lead a populist government if that meant listening to people's needs and working ""to remove old privileges and entrenched powers."" When he took that message to the European Parliament, liberal lawmaker and former Belgian premier Guy Verhofstadt lampooned him as a ""puppet"" of his deputy premiers: Salvini and M5S leader Luigi Di Maio. But he turned the tables on Salvini when, buoyed by a bumper crop of European election results, the League leader quit the government in August 2019 in a bid to force new polls. Conte himself resigned, lashing out at Salvini for pursuing his own interests, and went on to preside over an unlikely coalition between M5S and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), two former sworn enemies. In the first few terrifying months of the pandemic, the seemingly unflappable, dapper Conte appeared to many Italians as a safe pair of hands. ""Let's keep our distance today, so that we may be able to hug each other with more warmth tomorrow,"" he said at the start of a national lockdown in March. With Italy the first European Union country to be hit badly, Conte leveraged the crisis to plead for more solidarity and eventually secured the largest slice of a 750-billion-euro ($906 billion) EU recovery fund -- worth around 200-billion-euros ($196 billion). Conte's approval ratings surged to 65 percent, according to an Ipsos survey for Corriere della Sera newspaper, and in January were still in the mid-50s -- despite some signs of popular impatience with him. When news organisation Politico named Conte its ""Doer Number 1"" of 2020, it sparked mockery and anger on social media. Renzi has accused the premier and M5S of squandering the windfall of the EU funds and failing to have the vision to spend it. Critics also claim Conte hesitates over key decisions and failed to use the lull in infection rates last summer to prepare for a second wave that has proved deadlier than the first. In Bergamo, one of the Italian cities worst-hit by the virus, relatives of victims are suing Conte and other key government figures, citing a litany of official failures in the early stages of the epidemic. Born in 1964 in the tiny village of Volturara Appula in the southern region of Puglia, Conte was a law lecturer at the University of Florence. A devout Catholic and former leftist turned M5S supporter, he also taught at Rome's Luiss University -- although he has been accused of inflating parts of his CV. Conte is reportedly ""very religious"" and devoted to mystic Catholic saint Padre Pio, who was famous for exhibiting ""stigmata"" -- body marks supposedly matching the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. Of his own politics, he once said: ""I used to vote left. Today, I think that the ideologies of the 20th century are no longer adequate."" "
"CHENNAI: In the climax of his 2002 flop âBabaâ, Rajinikanth makes a last-minute return from sanyaas to socio-political life. On Tuesday, the actor made a virtual repeat of the theme, this time in reverse, going back on his promise to launch a political party. âI regret to announce that I am not in position to launch a party and enter politics. Only I know the pain behind this announcement. This will come as a disappointment to the members of RMM (Rajini Makkal Mandram), my fans and people. Forgive me,â Rajinikanth said in a three-page statement. âSome people may ridicule me. But fearing them, I cannot sacrifice those who trust and travel with me,â he said. Rajinikanth, who was shooting in Hyderabad for his latest movie last week, was hospitalised for three days with complaints of fluctuating blood pressure after four of the crew members tested positive for Covid-19. He tested negative for the virus. Rajinikanthâs announcement on Tuesday came as a shock for some, disappointment for some others, who were anticipating the actorâs promised December 31 announcement. Fans took to social media to express their views; many wished him good health. Some of them regrouped in front of his Poes Garden residence to make a last ditch attempt to make Rajini reconsider his decision. âVaanga Thalaiva, Naanga Irukkomâ (Come out, leader, we are here), one of the fans tweeted. âYou do not worry. We will take care of the hard work,â said another. RSS ideologue and Tuglak editor S Gurumurthy termed Rajinikanth's decision as âinevitableâ. He hoped Rajinikanth would still make an impact in the coming elections as he did in the 1996 assembly polls (when the actor had issued a statement against Jayalalithaa), which the DMK-TMC alliance won with a big majority. In his statement, Rajinikanth said despite the advice from doctors not to venture out, he had travelled to Hyderabad to shoot for a film. All the 120 people who participated in the shooting were made to follow strict Covid protocols and undergo tests every day, he said. âStill four people tested positive for Covid and the director halted the shooting to carry out Covid tests for all. The result was negative for me. But due to severe fluctuations in my blood pressure, I was admitted to a hospital and was monitored for three days. Fluctuating blood pressure is harmful for my transplanted kidney. I considered it as a warning from God. If despite strict protocols, four out of 120 could test positive, what could happen when thousands and even lakhs assemble for my campaign,â Rajinikanth said. The actor said he cannot trigger his desired uprising by campaigning merely through social media and videos. âIf I venture out, it could become a big risk for all, especially when a second wave of the virus is spreading. If a well-organised film shoot can result in my hospitalization for three days, participating in an election campaign could become even more risky and I do not want to leave people in the lurch midway,â he said.RMM functionaries have toiled hard over the past three years and served the people during Covid. Their efforts will not go waste. RMM will continue to function as usual. âI will continue to serve the people away from electoral politics. I never hesitated in expressing my honest opinion,â the actor said, thanking his RMM secretaries for abiding by his decisions. "
"In 1996, when actor Rajinikanthâs powerful one-liner â âeven God canât save Tamil Nadu if Jayalalithaa returns to powerâ â hit the high notes ahead of the assembly election, the political party that benefited the most was the DMK. Twenty-four years later, ahead of another assembly election, the DMK is rejoicing again, and the AIADMK is sighing in relief. The DMK was worried that Rajinikanth would take away a chunk of votes that would otherwise have come to it because of the anti-incumbency factor. The AIADMK, meanwhile, is happy that it would now be able to negotiate with the allies, especially the BJP, from a stronger position. Rajinikanth bids adieu to politics even before taking the plungeFor the DMK, Rajiniâs entry may have meant reworking its poll strategy and arithmetic. On December 3, when Rajinikanth tweeted that he would launch his political party in January after an announcement on December 31, it set off a scramble among parties to revise their strategies. âThe DMK decided not to react until the actor tossed his hat in the ring,â said a senior party leader. When DMK president M K Stalin was asked to comment, he merely said, âLet Rajinikanth launch his party first.â There has not been a mention of Rajini since. âIt was a conscious strategy to generate the perception that the DMK did not care,â said the leader. 'His wish, can't force him to change mind,' Rajini's bro on U-turn on political debutFor chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, Rajiniâs participation in politics would have meant a return of personality politics. Trying to emerge from J Jayalalithaaâs shadows, Rajiniâs celluloid charisma may have proved disconcerting for the âfarmer-common manâ CM candidate. But Palaniswami, too, put on an appearance of nonchalance. âLet him first register his party, Iâll comment then,â he had said. For the AIADMK, Rajiniâs dalliance with spiritual politics may have led to significant erosion of the Hindu vote base that they share. But for the ruling party, it would now be easier at the negotiating table when potential allies, the BJP, PMK and the DMDK sit to talk seat-sharing. Within the party too, senior leaders could have played power politics using Rajini as a bait. The BJP, which has been plotting a long-term plan to breach the Dravidian fort with Rajini as an interim disruptor, must be the most disappointed with the turn of events. It had spent months, even years, hoping to persuade Rajinikanth to take the political plunge, so it could ride piggyback, if not ride along with the star. The TN poll arena would once again see a straight fight between the DMK and the AIADMK. "
"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth finally ended the suspense over his political plans, saying on Thursday that he would launch a political party in January. A formal announcement would be made on December 31, Rajinikanth said, taking to Twitter and ending a wait of over 24 years for his fans. âWith the massive support of people we will capture power and provide a corruption-free and transparent government that will be above caste, creed and religion,â Rajinikanth said in a tweet. âChange. We will change everything. Miracle and wonder will happen. If not now, then never,â he tweeted, taking a leaf out of a campaign that his fans have been running over the past few months on the same slogan. As his announcement found traction, the actor followed up with a media conference. âI had made it clear on December 31, 2017 (when he addressed his fans here) that I will surely enter politics in time for the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. In March this year I said I wanted to see a wave and uprising from people wanting political change. I wanted to undertake a tour of the state to make that happen. But corona prevented that from happening,â Rajinikanth told reporters at his residence. âI underwent a renal transplant. When transplants are done, the bodyâs immunity level is brought down. Hence, doctors advised me against going out and meeting people at large,â he said. âIf one has to face Covid, the bodyâs immunity level should be very high. I thought about it. It is because of the prayers of the people of Tamil Nadu that my life was saved... I will be happy to give away (sic) my life for the sake of the people of this state,â Rajinikanth said. âThe time to change the fate of Tamil Nadu has come. Change of government and change in politics will happen. I am only a small tool. It is the people who have to usher in the change by extending your support. If I win, it will be your victory. If I lose, it will also be that of the people,â he said. The actor said he has already started work to launch a party and that he had given responsibility to supervise the work to Tamilaruvi Manian, president of Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam. âDespite criticism, he has stood by me ever since I made it clear that I will enter politics,â the actor said. He added that he has appointed R Arjuna Murthy, who was in BJP till a few days ago, as chief coordinator. "
"Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Saturday said the letter-politics seeking change in the party top leadership âreflected the insecurities and political ambitionsâ of the certain signatories. âNow that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had clearly stated that the party organisation and president would be elected in six months, it was unfortunate that some leaders continue making unwanted statements. Such statements become even more ridiculous as the demand for elections are being made by the leaders who either never contested the elections themselves or now even they themselves may not remember when they contested last,â Jakhar said. Stating that there were inherent contradictions in the letter written by them, he said they targeted Rahul Gandhi for âabetting division within the ranksâ by holding Youth Congress elections, and on the other hand they wanted elections to be held from block level to the national body despite pandemic crisis. âIs it not applying double standards? Will these elections then not create rift in the party,â he questioned. Instead of giving a serious thought before making statements on the issue, some leaders were trying only to protect their positions, which was a sign of frustration and weakness, he added. âOf course, I am a supporter of democracy in the party but there should be regular brainstorming within the party and the modalities of its implementation should be worked out through mutual deliberation,â Jakhar said.

"GUWAHATI: The beginning of the final fight against the Covid-19 pandemic has sparked a political slugfest over âfree vaccineâ ahead of the upcoming assembly election in the state. Following the beginning of the vaccination drive in the state, along with the other parts of the country, opposition parties, including Congress, accused the saffron party of taking political mileage by releasing vaccines in a hurry ahead of the elections. The Congress, which has pulled its socks to oust the BJP in the election, terming it âanti-indigenousâ, has accused the BJP of launching the vaccination drive at an early stage. âA section of experts and doctors said the vaccination began at an early stage. They said the vaccine has been released without any efficacy data. They have raised questions on the BJPâs motive behind the release of the vaccine in a hurry ahead of the elections,â Debabrata Saikia, senior Congress leader, said. Slamming the BJP, he further said, âWhatever you do, it should be acceptable by every section of society. But, a section of doctorsâ opposition to the vaccination has somehow revealed the ruling partyâs motive to take political mileage.â State BJP chief spokesperson Rupam Goswami accused the Congress of trying to create doubts among the people about the vaccine, so that people refrain from taking vaccines. âIt is not good to do politics with health and education. Vaccine is not only for BJP workers. It is for all, irrespective of political parties and ideologies. It is a matter of health and of humanity. So, there is no compromise with it,â he said. Saying that taking political mileage is a baseless criticism, he said, âA section of people always raises opposition to each and every matter. Even the Congress had said that there was no Covid-19. But unfortunately, former state chief minister Tarun Gogoi got infected with the virus and later succumbed to it. And for this, I would say, the leaders of the Congress are responsible.â Goswami further questioned the Congress on whether all states of the country are going for polls. âOpposition parties do not have any issue for which they have made vaccination drive an issue,â he said, adding that people wonât believe them as they have witnessed what the BJP has done for their welfare after coming to power.

"NEW DELHI: With the corporations alleging that politics was being played and the municipal health facilities were not being used for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday clarified that the number of locations during phase-I had been reduced across the country. Jain said this was not a political issue and the municipal facilities would be included when vaccination sites were expanded to 175. ""Around 5,000 sites were prepared across the country, but the central government reduced them to 3,300. In Delhi, the number was reduced to 81 sites. We removed the municipal sites as a strike is going on and it could have caused problems,"" he added. The corporations had prepared 159 sites, including 69 dispensaries and hospitals like Hindu Rao and Kasturba, where dry runs had also taken place. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash claimed that the municipal sites were removed at the last moment. ""Delhi government removed the sites just a day before vaccination started,"" he added. "
"Ranchi: The district administration here put an indefinite ban on political meetings, demonstrations and rallies at Albert Ekka Chowk, the heart of the city which has witnessed several protests and movements over the years, and its surrounding areas to ensure smooth implementation of the Covid-19 vaccination programme at Ranchi sadar hospital. The order, issued by SDO (sadar), came into effect from 7am on Saturday. It bans the assembly of more than five people (who are not a part of the emergency services) within an area which comes under 500 metre radius of the hospital. It states, âThe assembly of five or more people, except government personnel and people involved in government work, management, medical work, ambulance services and devotees headed to their places of worship and funeral processions, is not allowed until further orders.â âNo forms of meetings and mass gatherings will be allowed until further orders. Except for personnel employed in government duty, no one will be allowed in the area with weapons such as pistols, revolvers, lathis, bows and arrows, spears and other weapons,â the order states. The use of public address systems have also been banned indefinitely. Albert Ekka Chowk, also referred by its former name Firayalal Chowk, is a hotspot of political activities in the state capital along with Morhabadi Ground. The order, the administration said, was enforced to ensure social distancing and avoiding chaos and commotion near Ranchi sadar hospital premises. While the focus is on ensuring a smooth vaccination, the administration will also be up against the challenge of erring denizens who give Covid 19 protocols a slip with the arrival of vaccines. A day after the nationwide inoculation drive began, several commuters were spotted on Ranchiâs streets without face masks. When asked, Ranchi deputy commissioner Chavi Ranjan said, âWe are appealing to the people through our awareness campaigns to comply with the Covid-19 protocols. While vaccines have arrived, it will take months before targeted beneficiaries will be inoculated.â Ranjan added that specialised teams will continue to raid shops and other commercial establishments to check their compliance with the social distancing protocols. âThere will be no let-up in these drives,â he said.

"Chandigarh: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday accused Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh of siding with the Union government instead of supporting the farmers protesting against the farm laws. He also slammed his Punjab counterpart for his âwild accusationâ that the Delhi government had cleared the passage for implementation of the three laws, which, he said, was nothing but a false propaganda against the AAP government. Kejriwal said people know that the contentious laws were brought in by the Centre and were deemed to be in force after these getting the assent of the President. Accusing Amarinder of speaking the language of the Modi (Union) government when he stated that the Delhi government had implemented the draconian laws, he said, âHow can the Delhi state government or any other state government, for that matter, implement or amend the central laws passed by the Parliament?â Ever since the Delhi government had rejected the police request to convert the stadiums into makeshift detention centres, the NDA government was hell-bent on âspreading rumours about me and my governmentâ, he claimed. âThe NDA government entered into an arrangement with Amarinder Singh to mount a false and frivolous propaganda to defame me and my government for allegedly clearing the way for implementation of the contentious laws,â alleged Kejriwal.

"BHUBANESWAR: Expelled BJD MLA Pradeep Panigrahy said the party took action against him simply because he dared to raise his voice against the governmentâs alleged Covid mismanagement in Ganjam, which happens to be chief minister Naveen Patnaikâs home district. While the party expelled Panigrahy on charges of anti-people activities, he and his wife Sujata sought clarification about the exact nature of the anti-people allegations against him. Denying the charges, Panigrahy labelled the action as âpolitical vendettaâ. âI had written a series of letters to the chief minister as well as other senior government officers on the Covid mismanagement and the issue of migrant workers in Ganjam. Recently, I spoke directly with Naveen over phone after my attempts to arrange for an ambulance for the father of a BJD MLA of Ganjam district remained futile. Though he promptly intervened and resolved the issue, some leaders, who have been calling the shots in the party, were aggrieved with me,â Panigrahy told media persons at his quarters here. Panigrahy further said after his telephonic interaction with Naveen, two prominent BJD leaders met him at his house here and expressed their displeasure with him for raising the Covid-19 mismanagement issue. âThey indirectly threatened me of action and inquired about my daughterâs marriage. I could make out that they wanted to sabotage her wedding. It was an act of vendetta against me. I had told them that I would resign from the party if the party did not want me any more,â he added. It must be noted that Panigrahyâs daughter is set to marry Akash Pathak, son of the Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Abhay Kant Pathak. The vigilance sleuths arrested Abhay Kant and Akash on Friday on charges of amassing ill-gotten properties. Panigrahy is accused of showing political patronage to the Pathaks and availing of undue benefits, including air travels in chartered flights. âI know the government can raid my house any time and frame me in the vigilance or any other false case. I am ready to face any fair probe. I am not scared,â Panigrahy, who gave a clean chit to Abhay Kant and his son Akash, said. Panigrahy, a three-time MLA and former minister, was once a close aide of Naveen and assigned to look after the party affairs in Hinjili, the assembly constituency of Naveen, after the 2004 election.

"CHANDIGARH: With campaigning for Baroda bypoll gaining pace, allegations are flying back and forth between Congress and BJP leaders. The volley of attacks and demands for apologies is an extension of caste polarisation attempted by political parties in the fray. During a workersâ meeting, former speaker Kuldeep Sharma used objectionable words for agriculture minister Jai Parkash Dalal while referring to his caste. This gave BJP leaders the chance to demand an apology. Representatives of Dalal Khap expressed their umbrage by announcing boycott of the Congress. Sharma obliged by apologising on social media. In a bid to counter the issue, Dalit leaders and MLAs of the Congress, headed by former minister Geeta Bhukkal closed ranks against BJP candidate Yogeshwar Dutt, referring to his old remark on Dalits and reservation and demanding an apology. In a hurriedly convened press conference, Bhukkal and her team accused the BJP of being anti-Dalit. After a recent statement made by Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda and Congress MLA Kuldeep Vats on Haryana BJP president Om Parkash Dhankar, members of Dhankar Khap opened a front against Hooda and Vats. They also announced a dharna in Jhajjar. Ramesh Bamal, official spokesperson of the Congress says such issues will not affect the poll outcome. âCongress has senior and responsible leaders. As far as allegations are concerned, these are issues created by BJP from non-issues. Here, elections are contested on issues related to farmers, corruption and development. BJP and its leaders have resorted to this as elections have gone out of their hands,ââ he said. BJP says it is Congress which is resorting to divisive tactics. âThe Congress is known for divisive politics. They made objectionable comments at relatives of Ch Devi Lal in Sirsa and had to apologise,ââ said Attray. "
"CHENNAI: The balance of power has see-sawed between the DMK and the AIADMK for some five decades now in Tamil Nadu. But as we stumble and stagger into 2021 under the weight of the pandemic, actor Rajnikanth threatens to rewrite the stateâs political screenplay that has been steeped in the rhetoric of Dravidianism, Tamil and caste identity, and welfarism. The passing of M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa had put DMK president M K Stalin and chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami of the AIADMK centre stage. All year the spotlights shone on them, with Stalin coming into his own after the DMKâs spectacular electoral success in the previous yearâs Lok Sabha elections and Palanisami tightening control over the AIADMK and the state administration. But as the year was ending, Rajinikanth finally decided to make an entry in politics and now all the attention is on him. Pitted against old hands at the game, Rajini will need more than his commitment to âspiritual politicsâ to convince the voters, but his arrival has forced his rivals to review their strategies. Stalin and Palanisami appear sanguine, but Rajinikanthâs presence can change the Dravidian landscape. Palaniswami is battling a 10-year anti-incumbency and charges of corruption. But his performance as an administrator has won him grudging admiration from adversaries as well. Though a bit Machiavellianism, the way Palaniswami got the AIADMK and its coordinator and deputy CM O Panneerselvam to choose him as the partyâs CM candidate may have finally propelled him into the leadership league. EPS giving officials a free hand to rein in the pandemic, touring the state to review the Covid-19 situation gave him a clear advantage. After two cyclones battered parts of the state, EPS sniffed a water-soaked paddy tuft and waded through slushy fields to project himself as a farmer-common man-CM. âBut we have several disadvantages. After Amma (Jayalalithaa), there has been no attempt to woo woman voters. There is no woman representation in any decision-making body,â said a senior AIADMK leader. âThe leadershipâs focus has been on party and government crises management, not on organization building,â he said. Powered by a tech-savvy team, Stalin had admitted early on that he was no Karunanidhi. Stalinâs advantages include a reorganised and revitalised DMK that quelled internal feuding, one reason for the partyâs 2016 assembly poll debacle; the DMKâs great showing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections; and a frontline leadership that backs him to the hilt. Ten years of being out of power has, however, has put Stalin at a disadvantage, leaving him little to show for achievements. But the DMKâs and AIADMKâs calculations may come to naught if âdisrupterâ Rajinikanth storms the poll arena. There are other players too who could provide that twist to TN politics with the hope of changing its course forever. The BJP and the PMK, both AIADMK allies, have been playing the Hindu and vanniyar cards. While the BJPâs Vetrivel yatra never really took off and ended in a whimper, the PMKâs violent protest for 20% sub quota for the vanniyars too petered out. Both have their strengths that could help AIADMK, but with Rajiniâs political script still in the making, uncertainty looms large. Then there is the â5% vote bank leagueâ that includes Kamal Haasanâs Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), T T V Dhinakaranâs AMMK and Seemanâs Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK). With their oratory on alternative politics, they could cause a minor tremor. With son Vijaya Prabhakaranâs hold on the reins rather tentative, the future of Vijayakanthâs DMDK is rather hazy. A still tottering Congress and VCK may add strength to DMK, though how much is not clear. âHow 2021 will play out in politics depends on the direction Rajini takes,â said political and economic analyst and critic Sriram Seshadri. âIf he teams up with small outfits, it would be beneficial to DMK. If he teams up with BJP, there could be a consolidation of Hindu votes. If he strikes an alliance with AIADMK and its allies, it may prove formidable,â said Seshadri. He could also go it alone. 2021 is set to be the year of the voter, who will be spoilt for choice. Will you, the voter, fall for the lure of the poll dole or see a messiah in a superstar or choose the safe option of one of the Dravidian giants? Or will you spring a surprise? "
"Hyderabad: All arterial roads, even those in small neighbourhoods leading to the Kukatpally and LB Stadium were barricaded amid an increased police force, as the political road shows and public meetings were in progress, leaving motorists helpless on Saturday. All the roads leading to Moosapet, Kukatpally, Nizampet and Miyapur witnessed massive traffic jam between 4pm to 8pm due to the road show held by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who was in Hyderabad to garner voters for BJP in the upcoming GHMC elections. Many commuters, who were left waiting for the traffic to clear took to Twitter to alert the traffic police about the situation. Jagan V Reddy @JaganVreddy tweeted, â@hydcitypolice @HYDTP @KTRTRS Sir, kindly take care of the traffic situation in KPHB and Nizampet. Mainly due to election campaign.â Traffic was also moving slow on the roads leading to LB Stadium due to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Raoâs public meeting which was being held to garner votes for GHMC polls. Traffic moving from Abids and Gunfoundry was not allowed towards BJR Statue. The traffic was instead diverted at SBI Gunfoundry towards Chapel road. Slow movement of traffic was observed from AR Petrol Pump near LB Stadium, BJR Statue, Basheerbagh Flyover, Liberty Junction towards to Ambedkar Statue. "
"PATNA: The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on the annual gala feasts of âdahi-churaâ and tilkut organised by political parties on Makar Sankranti, as this year the celebrations will not be held citing social distancing protocols. However, sources said any individual minister or a leader may organize a feast at a personal level, but no such get-together will be held by any political party. For instance, Patna mayor Sita Sahu organized a dahi-chura feast at Tailik Utsav Hall in Patna on Wednesday, which was attended by former road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav and other dignitaries. But the much-awaited dahi-chura organized by senior JD (U) leader and former state president Vashishath Narayan Singh at his Hardinge Road residence will be missed by the party workers as well as senior leaders. This traditional feast used to be attended by chief minister Nitish Kumar and other senior leaders cutting across party lines. JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said, âKeeping in mind Covid-19 protocols, there will be no such feast this year. We will miss the get-together organised by dada as we all used to get a chance to meet one another and even our respected CM and seek blessings of our elderly.â RJD which has been skipping dahi-chura feast for more than a couple of years, will not be holding any get-together this year too. RJDâs national president Lalu Prasad has instead asked his party leaders as well as workers to distribute dahi-chura and tilkut among the poor on the occasion. Even BJP leaders are avoiding any political feast on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. Every year, the partyâs MLC Rajnish Kumar used to hold a big feast, but spokesperson Nikhil Anand said because of Covid-19, any such get-together has been avoided. Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha also cited Covid-19 protocol as a reason behind holding no event at party office on the occasion of Makarsankranti. The Grand Old Party had organised a gala feast at Sadaqat Ashram which was attended by all the Mahagatbandhan leaders, including Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as well as VIP chief Mukesh Sahni and RLSP head Upendra Kushwaha, who was part of the alliance.

"At Jayasree Kalathilâs London home, Kerala is never far away. Although this is her 18th year in the UK, she lives and breathes Malayalam literature. Formally an academic and researcher, Jayasreeâs work âMoustacheâ, the English translation of S Hareeshâs Malayalam novel âMeeshaâ, recently won the prestigious JCB Prize for Literature. âMoustacheâ is her second translation work. Her first was N Prabhakaranâs âDiary of a Malayali Madmanâ, a book she wrote to keep herself busy while waiting in various government offices to settle her late fatherâs papers. Born in Kottackal in Malappuram, Jayasree was surrounded by books in her childhood. âMy Amma loves books,â she says. âShe used to give me pocket money to buy books from mobile bookstalls run by Prabhat. Thatâs how I hooked on reading.â Since the mid-90s, Jayasree has been working for mental health survivors. She moved to London in 2003. âI met my husband in India. A British citizen, he was working in an NGO in Odisha then. I was there for a brief period, writing for their website. The only reason I came to London is because we decided to get married,â she says. In 2007, she founded Survivor Research, a virtual collective of volunteers interested in mental health issues and how it affects black and minority ethnic communities in the UK. Today, she balances her time between literary writing, academic papers and running Survivor Research. How much of Jayasree Kalathil can be found in âMoustacheâ? Are you a mere translator or have you left something of yourself in the work?I believe any good translation is a collaboration between the writer and the translator. Bad translations happen when a work is translated text bytext. Translation is a creative process. I am loyal to the story and the storytelling, even more than to the author. But, I also like a certain level of freedom in the translations. I want to translate in a way that I believe is suitable for the book. I choose each word just like how the writer chooses his words, which is a carefully thought-out creative process. I always believe that there can never be an entirely faithful translation that is also readable in a different language. Because language itself has its own different syntaxes, music, etc. that you canât translate to another language in the same way. So, thereâs definitely a lot of me in âMoustacheâ. But the important thing is whether Iâm telling the story in the same way that the author intended to tell in a different language. Meesha is a story rooted in Kuttanad. Having lived in London for so long, how did you relate to the original story?I have only visited Kuttanad as a tourist. So I had to do a lot of research. I extensively read its history and scientific reports on below-sea-level farming. I have also been a fan of nature, and have a collection of books on birds and fish. I read a lot of those books again. I also did a lot of image searches. Just looking at photos of paddy fields and fish, I was constantly surrounded by elements of Kuttanad. In fact, I went down a rabbit hole as I read more and more about the place. The essence of âMeeshaâ is its colloquial elements â itsâRegionalityâ is always a difficult challenge in translation. But my way is not to start by worrying about the regionality. My focus is on the authorâs style of storytelling, his tone and music. There is no single recipe when translating regionality. Also, I donât start at the beginning of the book and translate until the end. I pick and choose usually the bits I really like. And at some point, I feel this is beginning to sound like the original. It is almost like an iterative process of doing various versions of the same writing. I try not to mainstream the language. Rather than translating to standard English, I choose the English that suits the book. I believe this method is better than making a book legible to people reading in every part of the world. It is about focussing on the story and storytelling than anything else. What was the main challenge of translating âMeeshaâ?There is a whole chapter of folk songs in Meesha. That was the most difficult part. I kept it for the last. Despite trying many times, I was not satisfied. Although I wrote it in English, I was reading it in a Malayalam tune. That wasnât working at all. I remember discussing it with Hareesh and he told me about how these folk songs are sung by different people in different ways. So he asked me to forget about the original rhyme and rhythm. That helped me overcome the challenge. How much was Hareesh involved in the translation process?We always kept in touch on WhatsApp. I sent him all the chapters. There were a couple of places where he had to share his angle. He was always there to ask âif this was what I meantâ. But there wasnât any time when we had any difference of opinion. Did the controversies regarding âMeeshaâ bother you in any manner while translating the work?I donât stand bullies. I was fully aware of the controversies. But for me, it is very important that I agree with the politics of the book I translate. And I believe every writing is political. I understood what Hareesh was trying to do, why he was telling the story, and why he chose a particular way of telling that story. The controversy was instigated by people who did not even bother reading the book. It came from just the dialogues between two random characters. If you want to be controversial about the book, there are way more other stuff that you would have been worried about. What are your ongoing works?I have just finished the draft for N Prabhakaranâs 'Thiyoor Rekhakal', which is scheduled to publish in April. I am working on a collection of Hareeshâs short stories named âAadamâ. I have also told my editor that I want to translate womenâs books. We are completing the discussion to translate Sheela Tomyâs âValliâ, which was published last year. I am really looking forward to doing that. Who are the authors who have influenced you the most?I have always been a big fan of Rajalakshmi. I have always been interested in the topic of madness from a young age. Although Rajalakshmi doesnât deal with madness in her works, the idea of womenâs distress is quite central to her story. Besides her, I love Basheer, Kamala Das, Sara Joseph and N Prabhakaran. There are translators who dedicate their lives to one author. So, if I have to dedicate like that, it would be N Prabhakaran. I love his works. What is your writing process?I tend to wake up very early, by 4-4.30am. By the time the world wakes up, I would have done 4-5 hours of writing. I read in the afternoon. I tend to not read similar works when I am writing. For example, when I translate something like âMoustacheâ, I might read more poetry rather than similar kinds of fiction. I work on the computer, but print out the drafts and do the corrections on paper. "
"Kolkata/Durgapur: Rival politicians made a beeline for Swami Vivekanandaâs Simla Street residence on his 158th birth anniversary on Tuesday with the message that they were with the monk who took Indiaâs âsanatan dharmaâ to the world. National BJP leaders, namely Union minister of culture Prahlad Patel and Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya, and Trinamool Congressâs Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay were together in a frame paying tribute to Swamiji. âThere should be no politics over Vivekananda. We have been trained at the Yuva Morcha and Swamiji remains our idol. I have grown up seeing his photograph and reading his works. Although I came here to attend some party programmes, I did not want to miss the opportunity to pay tributes to him,â said Patel. On the streets, however, politics got precedence with Bengal BJP seniors Dilip Ghosh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari leading a bannerless BJP Yuva rally from Shyambazar to Simla Street. âThis is not the first time I have attended Swamijiâs birth anniversary. I have been coming to the Simla Street residence of Swamiji for the past 20 years,â Adhikari said. Bengal BJP president Ghosh, responding to TMC MP Abhishek Banerjeeâs charges against BJP, welcomed a debate over Vivekananda. âLet political parties express their views on Swamiji. We want a debate. I wish Trinamool to remember Swamiji every year, and not only during the election year,â he said. âI told them (BJP leaders) that if a statue of Ballavbhai Patel can be constructed at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore, we can definitely spend Rs 300 crore for building Swamijiâs statute,â Bandyopadhyay said. Far away at Durgapur, the anniversary turned into a political show. Adhikari didnât miss out the opportunity to hit out at TMC after remembering Swamiji on International Youth Day. âI had been with Trinamool for long. But I quit the party after it became a private limited company. Lala, Enamul and Benoy Mishra represent the party now,â he said. The TMC-turned-BJP leader didnât stop at that. âThe Trinamool government is responsible for the present de-industrialisation and unemployment in Bengal,â he added. "
"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a fresh attack on dynastic succession and sense of entitlement in the countryâs politics, saying it is a menace and new form of dictatorship, which needs to be uprooted for which youth of the country could play the most vital role. âSome necessary changes in politics are yet to happen. Dynastic politics, which is the biggest enemy of democracy, is still flourishing. Dominance of dynastic succession in politics is the biggest enemy of the country, which needs to be rooted out,â the Prime Minister said. Exhorting the youth, the PM, who was addressing the valedictory function of the National Youth Parliament Festival, organised at the Central Hall of Parliament on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, said, âIt is true that the days of those winning polls by virtue of surnames are numbered but the disease of dynasty in politics is not over completely.â Modi has consistently targeted Congress and BJPâs regional rivals for being dynastic outfits. He said there are certain people in politics for whom the sole agenda is how to safeguard the dominance of their families. âYeh rajnitik vanshvad loktantra me ek naye rup ke tanashashi ke saath hi desh par akshamata ka bojh bhi badhata hai,â (dynastic succession in politics is not only a new kind of dictatorship but also imposes an inefficient leadership on the country,â the PM said. Modi said dynasties in politics think about their families first and nation comes later for them, which is also a huge reason for political and social corruption in India. âDynastic successors in politics feel that their ancestors, despite being corrupt, remained unscathed. They see this deformed tendency in their families, therefore, they develop a sense of entitlement and neither they respect nor fear the law of land,â the PM said. Although Modi and other BJP functionaries have highlighted the issue on several occasions but this could be the harshest criticism of the trend in the countryâs politics which the saffron party has been highlighting to not only target the Gandhi-Nehru family but several regional parties, which are predominantly led by particular political families. The PM said this trend can be changed through awareness in which youth of the country will have to take the responsibility. âAs long as youth of the country doesnât come forward and join politics, the poison of dynastic succession will continue to weaken the democracy of our country,â he said. He said there was a time when politics used to be synonymous with loot, corruption but it has changed now and people of the country are encouraging and supporting honest people as honesty and performance are integral to politics now. âThose who had borrowed corruption as legacy, it has become burdensome for them. They have not been able to get rid of their corrupt legacy,â Modi said and added that even public representatives have realised importance of a strong CV to contest polls. Three young national winners of the Festival also spoke on the occasion. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and Youth Affairs & Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju also spoke. The PM remarked that even with the passage of time, impact and influence of Swami Vivekananda remains. âHis views on nationalism and nation-building and his teachings regarding serving the people and serving the world continue to inspire us.â Speaking on the occasion, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said, âWe should resolve to make the highest use of the energy and power of the youth for the revival of our country and strengthening its constitution and Parliament.â "
"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday blasted dynastic politics as the ""biggest enemy"" of democracy and said it gives rise to a new form of ""dictatorship"" and burdens the country with ""incompetence"". Addressing the valedictory function of the second National Youth Parliament Festival, Modi launched an all out attack on dynastic parties, saying those who rise due to their dynasties have no respect and fear of law as they believe if their previous generations were not accounted for corruption, none can touch them as well. ""They see such examples in their own families. So they have neither respect nor fear of law,"" he said, asking youngsters to join politics as this is ""necessary"" to save it. Though he did not name any party but he has in the past often hit out at opposition parties, including the Congress, for being run by families. He said, ""It is true that (in politics) the fortunes of those who have been winning elections on the basis of surnames are dwindling. But in politics, this disease of dynastic politics is not completely finished."" They, he said in a reference to these dynasties, are also a very big reason behind political and social corruption in the country. Though people have now been supporting honesty and performance, and the legacy of ""corruption"" of those in dynastic politics have become a burden for them, but the ""disease of dynastic politics"" has not been fully eradicated, the Prime Minister said. ""There are still people whose conduct, ideas and goals are all aimed at saving their family politics and their families in politics. Dynastic politics gives rise to a new form of dictatorship in democracy and burdens the country with incompetence. Dynastic politics only strengthens the sentiment of 'me and my family' instead of 'nation first',"" he said. Modi, however, added that things have changed from a time when people associated politics with ""violence, corruption and loot"" and thought it cannot change. A youngster joining politics was seen as someone who has gone astray, he said. People are now so aware that they stand with honest people in politics and give them a chance, he said, asserting that honesty and performance have become ""first essential requirements of today's politics"". This has happened due to pressure created by the awareness in the country, he said, before noting that some changes are still required and highlighting dynastic politics as the ""biggest enemy"" of democracy. ""The biggest enemy of democracy still exists and that is dynastic politics. Dynastic politics is such a challenge before the country that has to be rooted out,"" he said. Exhorting youngsters to join politics in his virtual address, the Prime Minister said the ""poison of dynastic politics"" will continue to weaken democracy unless they enter it. The nation's politics like any other sector needs them and their new thoughts, energy, ideas and dreams a lot, he said. Referring to dynastic politics, he said this can be changed through awareness and the young generation joining politics. His government has been organising and promoting youth-related events, including holding mock parliament, to prepare the young generation in this regard, Modi said. The speeches of three national winners of the festival were also broadcast during the event in the central hall of Parliament. Lauding them, Modi said he would tweet links to their speech and also those of other participants in the final round. In his address, he also paid rich tributes to Swami Vivekananda, whose birth anniversary fell on Tuesday, and said his ideals have inspired people, including during the freedom struggle, of every generation and asked youngster to follow them. Vivekananda's views on nationalism and nation-building and his teaching regarding serving the people and serving the world continue to inspire us, he said. "
"ISLAMABAD: The recent arrest and subsequent release of former prime minister Nawaz Sharifâs son-in-law in Karachi has heightened the political tension in Pakistan by directly involving the army and police, men in uniform, in a battle between the incumbent government and Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance comprising 11 opposition parties with the sole purpose of ousting prime minister Imran Khan from office. Sharif had drawn new battle lines in the ongoing political turmoil when, at an October 16 PDM rally in Gujranwala, Pakistan Punjab, he named the Army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as the âselectorsâ and main backers of the âincompetent and selectedâ PM Imran Khan and his âfailedâ government. Sharifâs narrative, countered poorly by the government which termed it a Narendra Modi-led agenda, has changed PDMâs entire battle plan. The original plan was meant to expose the failed policies and poor performance of Khanâs government. Though Sharif had skipped speaking at a second PDM rally in Karachi on October 18, his anti-military line was taken forward by other opposition leaders, including his daughter Maryam Nawaz, Jamiat-i-Ulema Islam (F) chief and PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and nationalist leaders from Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Analyst Nazrul Islam says it is not the first time that the military leadership has been blamed for conspiring against civilian leaders and governments in the country. âMore alarming is that civilian rulers for the first time are blaming a serving army chief, and not a military ruler, for all the wrongdoing in the country,â Islam said. Hours after the Karachi rally, police had barged into Maryamâs hotel room and arrested her husband on charges of raising slogans at the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Following the arrest, Maryam, the Sindh government, and opposition leaders claimed that the Sindh police chief was kidnapped and kept hostage for four hours at the office of the sector commander of the Pakistan Rangers, a paramilitary force, and forced to register an FIR after refusing to take any action against Capt Muhammad Safdar (Retd), Maryamâs husband. On Tuesday, the Sindh police spilled the beans after several high-ranking officials applied for leave citing demoralisation of the police force. The move had built enormous pressure on the security establishment, prompting the army chief to order an inquiry into the Karachi incident. Gen Bajwa, the armyâs media wing said, has directed the Karachi corps commander to âimmediately inquire into the circumstances to determine the facts and report back as soon as possibleâ. Aamir Ghauri, editor of The News, says all political forces are being tested to the maximum â âthe government for delivering on promises, the opposition from strength to pull down the government and the army for its ability to underpin a favourite. People are still largely playing the perplexed spectatorâ. âThe latest action by the Sindh police, however, has given a new turn to the circus. If the bureaucracy becomes a party to the political malaise, it could tip the balance in favour of the opposition. The next few months are going to be very interesting provided there is no external input,â Ghauri said. With no clue to how the PM will handle the political crisis, there is increasing pressure on the security establishment to deal with the situation. Any action against the opposition directly or indirectly involving the security agencies could deepen the crisis. "
"CHANDIGARH: Even before WhatsApp's new privacy policy sent its users into a spin this week, most political activists in Punjab have already switched to Telegram for the internal circulation of their content. Satish Singh, political strategist who was involved with the 2017 Punjab campaign as part of I-PAC said, âTelegram has become the new hotspot for all political parties to distribute the unofficial and uncensored messages to the voters. Telegram is a message driven end-to-end encrypted messenger service which is used for sending big files to the recipients. âThe app also offers a unique feature, self-destructing messages (like Snapchat) which is great if youâre sending messages that you donât want to remain on the recipientâs device for eternity. The size limit for sharing files on Telegram is high at 1.5 GB,â he added. Telegram brings support for groups with up to 200,000 members. It also offers multiple group-specific features such as bots, polls, quizzes, hashtags, and a lot more which can make group experiences a lot more fun. Meanwhile, the group of youth running the âTractor2Twitterâ campaign to support the farmersâ agitation against the Centreâs farm laws too is using Telegram for sharing content between those involved in content generation. The Telegram group has over 1,200 members, said Manik Goyal, member of the core team running the campaign. "
"Trichy: Although the Trichy corporation is coming under criticism for lack of enforcement in preventing stray cattle from disturbing road traffic, officials are facing political pressure from influential people to drop charges levelled against negligent cattle owners. The recent attempts by the local body to impound cattle straying near the Trichy railway junction resulted in cattle owners flexing their political muscle to either reduce or scrap the penalty levied.Trichy Corporation sources said that all the bovines hindering vehicular movement on roads have proper owners. To cut down the feed cost, the cattle are made to wander on the city roads, feeding on food waste dumped on vacant plots. For almost the entire day, cattle including cows rest on the road endangering the safety of pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. This apart, on an average around 3-4 livestock get injured after being run over by heavy vehicles. Corporation officials said that attempts to impound stray cattle always end in verbal altercation with the owners. âRecently, we seized six livestock on Rockins road for causing a public nuisance. The cattle owners, upset over the move, started calling politically influential people for support. Despite the threats, we levied a penalty of Rs 2,000,â an official with the corporation said. While it is usual to levy a penalty of Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per animal, due to political intervention officials reduce the penalty.The staff said that such political pressure is keeping them away from securing cattle and penalising the owners. Although the city corporation has no elected ward councillors now, the influence of local functionaries, mostly from the ruling party, is making local body officials ignore the menace. âOnly the police can resolve the issue by booking cases under IPC section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal). We cannot confront the political influence,â another official with the corporation added. With assembly election round the corner, corporation sources said sustained impounding of cattle straying on roads is an unlikely task."
"SEOUL: North Korea has opened the first full congress of its ruling party in five years, with leader Kim Jong Un admitting his previous economic development plans have failed. The congress could be crucial, coming as it does amid what some experts see as the most fraught moment of Kim's nine-year rule. The Workers' Party congress, which was revived by Kim in 2016 after a 36-year hiatus, began on Tuesday as North Korea, one of the world's poorest countries, faces what Kim has called ""huge challenges and difficulties"" brought on by an economy hammered by pandemic-related border closings, a spate of natural disasters and harsh US-led sanctions meant to stop the country from putting the finishing touches on its illicit nuclear-tipped missile program. The meeting will also be closely watched by, and may be meant to send a message to, US. President-elect Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated later this month. Biden has called Kim a ``thug'' and criticized his nuclear summitry with President Donald Trump. Here are a few things to know about the biggest political event of the year in North Korea: WHAT IS IT?The congress is the top decision-making organ of the Workers' Party. Kim, the party chairman, determines key day-to-day decisions together with members of his inner circle, but the congress' responsibilities include the formulation of new policies, reviews of past projects, revisions of party regulations and a reshuffling of officials' positions. This year's congress is the eighth since Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, held the first one in 1945. Kim Il Sung had six congresses before he died in 1994. His son, Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011, never held a congress. Some experts say Kim Jong Il's ""military-first"" policy helped undermine the influence of the Workers' Party during his 17-year rule. Kim Jong Un revived the congress in 2016 as part of his efforts to increase the party's authority and cement his grip on power. It was the first congress since 1980, four years before he was born. Kim turns 37 on Friday. It's unclear how long this year's congress will last. The 2016 congress met for four days. In 1980 it was five days, and 12 days in 1970. WHY HOLD IT NOW?Past party rules required North Korea to hold a congress every five years, but revised guidelines in 2010 don't specify how often it should be convened. Some experts say Kim needs a big state meeting like this to lay out a new vision for the nation and to strengthen public loyalty at a difficult time in his rule. North Korea's yearlong closure of its borders to guard against Covid-19 saw its trade volume plummet with China, its biggest trading partner, by about 80% in the first 11 months of 2020. Typhoons and floods last summer destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure across North Korea. Pyongyang has said that persistent US.-led sanctions against its nuclear bomb program are meant to ``strangle and stifle'' the country. During a public speech marking the party's 75th anniversary in October, Kim fought back with tears as he thanked his people for enduring the triple blow to the economy. ""On this planet at present, our country is the only one that is faced with (such) huge challenges and difficulties, like dealing with the anti-epidemic emergency and recovering from the catastrophic natural disasters, when everything is in short supply owing to the harsh and prolonged sanctions,'' Kim said. North Korea, which has a broken medical infrastructure and deep poverty, has taken some of the world's toughest anti-virus measures, and claims to be coronavirus-free, an assertion widely disputed by foreign experts. Experts also say that Kim shares a high level of responsibility for the economic woes. Kim has repeatedly told his people that nuclear weapons are a ``powerful treasured sword'' that are needed because of persistent US hostility. But a string of high-profile weapons tests in past years aimed at acquiring the ability to launch precision nuclear strikes on the American homeland have led to tougher US-led sanctions that experts say are gradually drying up North Korea's foreign currency reserves. WHAT'S AT STAKE?During this month's congress, North Korea has said it will announce new economic developmental goals for the next five years. State media said Wednesday the congress' gathering is meant to ``discuss and decide on a fresh line of struggle and strategic and tactical policies for making a radical leap forward in the development of the party and socialist construction.'' An earlier Workers' Party statement said its previous ``goals for improving the national economy have been seriously delayed.'' Some observers say North Korea may be forced to aim for modest objectives from this congress because it must continue to focus against the coronavirus. Others says North Korea, which recently completed an 80-day ``productivity campaign,'' might call for more such campaigns to squeeze its people for increased labor. During several speeches expected at the congress, Kim will likely repeat his commitment to his nuclear development program but may signal a willingness to engage with the incoming Biden administration and rival South Korea. Kim's state media, which previously called Biden ``a rabid dog,'' have remained silent over the next U.S. president's election victory. Other possible moves at the congress include Kim getting a new high-profile position, such as ``generalissimo,'' a title held by his late father and grandfather; his influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, may also be appointed a member of the powerful Politburo in a bid to reinforce the Kim family's rule, experts say.

"MUMBAI: Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday said some frustrated political players are doubting the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines made in India. Naqvi's remarks came after some Congress leaders raised doubts on the restricted use approval granted to Bharat Biotechs vaccine while its third phase trial is still underway. Speaking after chairing a meeting of Haj Committee of India officials and Haj Group organisers at Haj House in south Mumbai, Naqvi said these ""failed and frustrated political players"" had earlier questioned the relief measures taken by the Modi government during the coronavirus pandemic. The Modi government has tirelessly and effectively worked to provide relief to every needy person during the pandemic, he said, adding Modi has led the fight against the pandemic. Modi turned a crisis into an opportunity to make India aatmanirbhar (self-reliant), Naqvi said. In an unprecedented measure, the Modi government provided free ration to over 80 crore people, and free gas cylinders to over 8 crore families, a statement from Naqvi's office said. ""Rs 1500 were deposited into bank accounts of 20 crore women and Rs 19,000 crore was given under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi to over 10 crore farmers,"" it said. Aatmanirbhar Bharat package worth Rs 20 lakh crore was given to various sectors including Rs one lakh crore to agriculture sector, Naqvi said. Over 60 lakh migrant labourers reached back to their home states during the pandemic through Shramik Special trains and Rs 17,000 crore were given to states under the State Disaster Relief Fund for providing assistance to migrant labourers, he added. Naqvi said the vaccines have been developed by hard- working scientists of India and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that the two vaccines approved for emergency use are made in India. "
"HYDERABAD: The TRS state executive is meeting here on Sunday amid a growing buzz that TRS working president KT Rama Rao could soon be elevated to chief minister. The meeting, to be attended by leaders and elected representatives from the district to state levels, will be chaired by TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. This will be the first meeting of the party executive after TRSâ reverses in the Dubbak and GHMC elections. KCR is likely to provided clarity on many issues, especially on TRS-BJP relations, in the wake of confusion over the partyâs stand on the central farm laws. âThe party leadership is not happy with the election results, which went in favour of BJP in Dubbak and the GHMC polls. Our leader will boost the morale of the cadre at this meeting,â a senior leader said. âThe executive will deliberate on how to deal with BJP in Khammam and Warangal municipal corporations, the MLC elections and the Nagarjunasagar assembly bypoll,â the leader added. KCR will also take a call on the party plenary, generally held every year on April 27, the party foundation day. The party could not hold its plenary in 2019 due to the Lok Sabha elections and in 2020 due to the pandemic and lockdown. âIf the party wants to hold the plenary, the venue will be decided at Sundayâs meeting,â a TRS office-bearer said. Sources said the TRS has about 60 lakh members in the state and wants the numbers to go up to 80 lakh. A leader said KCR will also offer clarity on nominated posts, party committees and opening of TRS offices in the districts. The meeting will be attended by state executive committee members, ministers, MLAs, MPs, MLCs, zilla parishad chairpersons, corporation chairmen, mayors and municipal chairpersons, and cooperative bodiesâ chairpersons.

"SHIMLA: A day after a video of a policeman thrashing a tourist inside Atal Tunnel Rohtang went viral on the social media, director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu on Monday issued instructions to police personnel deployed at the tunnel to strictly enforce the law, but at the same time remain polite but firm in their interaction. He made it clear that in no case, the police personnel should transgress the boundaries set by law. Kundu has written to the SPs of Lahaul-Spiti and Kullu districts beside the Commandant of 3rd Indian Reserve Battalion Pandoh on this issue. He said since its inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 3 last year, the tunnel has become a major tourist destination. He said some of these travellers are violating the laws and not following necessary guidelines, especially MV Act provisions. âAs such, it is imperative for the police personnel deployed in the ATR to strictly enforce the law, but at the same time remain polite but firm in their interactions with the public travelling through ATR,â he said. He said that there are sufficient provisions under the law, which inter-alia include the MV Act, IPC, CrPC and HP Police Act 2007 to deal with unruly and boisterous travellers who violate the law while travelling through ATR. He has directed the Commandant of 3rd Battalion Pandoh to train the police personnel for soft skills on interacting and dealing with the public travelling through ATR. He said that it should be ensured that all police personnel deployed for ATR duties receive such training before their induction. He said their soft skills should be reviewed also be upgraded regularly through in-service courses. He has directed the officers to ensure the prompt and strict compliance of his instructions by the police deployed for the security of ATR. "
"BHOPAL: A day after announcing to launch a de-addiction campaign in Madhya Pradesh, BJP leader Uma Bharti wrote to CM hivraj Singh Chouhan, clarifying that the drive would only be an awareness campaign against alcohol and drug consumption. âI had stated about a public awareness campaign against drug abuse and alcoholism in the state. You being a righteous person, is also worried about poor people getting ruined by alcohol and drug addiction. I have made clear that there should be no political intent on the issue or undue pressure on the state government, but a sincere effort to help people quit addiction voluntarily by awakening their social consciousness,â stated the letter by the former chief minister. The BJP leader said that in the independent India of Mahatma Gandhiâs imagination, prohibition was a goal. Bharti said that MP is a peaceful state with a cultural heritage and on March 8, which happens to be International Womenâs Day, discussions will be held on efforts towards social awakening. âWe will continue to exchange thoughts with you (CM) in this regard. My effort would be to play a cooperative role with the government in controlling alcohol,â she said. Bharti had on Wednesday announced to launch a statewide campaign against alcohol. Her announcement came at a time when opposition Congress has been targeting the government on liquor. Minister Vishvas Sarang defended Bharti and said that he would support the cause. "
"DHARAMSALA: Hundreds of Tibetans in exile braved the rain and cold Sunday in Dharamsala, where the exiled government is based, and voted for their new political leader as the current officeholder's five-year term nears its end. The voters wore masks, maintained social distance and used hand sanitizer as they cast their ballots during the first round of the election. Many assisted elderly voters to fill the correct forms. In this first phase of voting, two candidates for the top government post of president will be shortlisted, including 90 parliamentarians. The second and final round of voting will take place in April. ""By this we are sending a clear message to Beijing that Tibet is under occupation but Tibetans in exile are free. And given a chance, an opportunity, we prefer democracy,"" said Lobsang Sangay, who will soon be finishing his second and final term as the Tibetan political leader. ""No matter what you do, the pride of Tibetans, the sense of Tibetans, is to be democratic and practice democracy."" Formed in 1959, Tibet's government-in-exile - now called the Central Tibetan Administration - has executive, judiciary and legislative branches, with candidates for the office of sikyong, or president, elected since 2011 by popular vote. China says Tibet has historically been part of its territory since the mid-13th century, and its Communist Party has governed the Himalayan region since 1951. But many Tibetans say that they were effectively independent for most of their history, and that the Chinese government wants to exploit their resource-rich region while crushing their cultural identity. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetans' exiled spiritual leader, and his followers have been living in Dharamsala since they fled Tibet after a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Many young Tibetans are contesting the parliamentary election this year. As the Dalai Lama grows older, there is a growing realisation among the Tibetan youth that they should participate more in the government. ""As somebody who has studied technology, I believe I can try and make the parliamentary communications more secure and fill the gaps in information database,"" said Lobsang Sither, 48, who is contesting the current election. Sither said that the previous governments have largely focused on the Tibetan diaspora and not enough on Tibetans inside Tibet. ""That has to change. Unless we have reliable information on the situation inside Tibet, we cannot formulate policies to assist Tibetans there,"" said Sither. China doesn't recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile, and hasn't held any dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama since 2010. Some Tibetan groups advocate independence for Tibet, since little progress has been made in dialogue with China. "
"Vadodara: The Jhalod unit of the Congress brought out a rally and gave a bandh call on Friday to protest the arrest of Amit Katara in connection with the murder of a municipality councillor Hiren Patel. Amit was presented before a court in Jhalod in Dahod district on Friday evening and remanded to three days police custody.Patelâs murder is believed to be a fallout of a political rivalry. Amitâs family includes his brother Bhavesh Katara, the Congress MLA from Jhalod and his father, Babu Katara, a former Dahod MP. His wife was elected as the president of the Jhalod municipality only to be ousted by defection engineered by Patel.The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) had nabbed Imran Gudala, a close aide of Amit, earlier this week. It was Gudala who allegedly named Amit as a prime accused in the case. The state government had asked the ATS and Ahmedabad crime branch to join the probe. A memorandum submitted by Jhalod Congress alleged that its members were being harassed as the party had become strong in the Jhalod taluka after Babu and Bhavesh joined the Congress in 2017. The memorandum alleged that representations regarding some angles that needed to be looked into in connection with his murder had been made, but were ignored.They alleged that the police was acting under political pressure. Babu too met reporters and claimed that his son was innocent. A bandh call given in Jhalod to protest against the arrest of Amit was also successful."
"PATNA: Former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) on Monday denied media reports about its merger with the ruling JD(U). âThe reports running in news channels and newspapers about the RLSP merger are wrong and baseless. The RLSP will continue its struggle keeping in mind the aspirations of the partyâs comrades and people of Bihar and the country,â RLSP said on Monday in a tweet posted in Hindi by its official Twitter handle. Kushwaha retweeted the post from his verified Twitter handle. âThe RLSP has planned to organize around 10,000 âKisan Chaupalsâ across Bihar from February 2 to 28 to lodge its protest against the Centreâs three anti-farmer farm legislations. Had there been any merger plan with the JD(U) which is an ally of the NDA, the RLSP would not have decided to organize âKisan Chaupalsâ against the NDA governmentâs farm legislation. We are going to protest the anti-farmer legislation across the state,â the RLSP national general secretary-cum-spokesperson Fazal Imam Mallick told TOI over the phone on Monday. Mallick too denied media reports about the RLSP merger with any NDA ally. Earlier on Sunday, speculation was rife in the media after Kushwaha went to meet Bihar CM Nitish Kumar at his official residence at 1, Anney Marg here. Both met for nearly 45 minutes. JD(U)âs former state president and Rajya Sabha member Bashishtha Narain Singh was present at the meeting. After the meeting, Singh told media persons on Sunday that he was hopeful that Kushwaha would merge his party with JD(U). It was Kushwahaâs second meeting with Nitish after the 2020 assembly polls in which the RLSP could not win any seat. Earlier, Kushwaha had called on Nitish at the CM residence on December 2 last year, fuelling speculations about a possible merger. Political analysts say, RLSP too is looking for a suitable platform after its humiliating defeat in the 2020 assembly polls. "
"LUCKNOW: Aam Aadmi Party MP and UP in charge Sanjay Singh said that it was time to end the communal and caste politics in UP, saying that his party would campaign on the basis of its Delhi model of development. The party has recently announced its plans of contesting elections in six states over the next two years, including UP, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. Singh says that with Congress weakened significantly, AAP is being seen as an alternative at the national level, having delivered on its promise of development in Delhi. Elaborating on the partyâs strategy for UP, Singh said that the upcoming zila panchayat elections would be crucial for it, after which it would prepare for the 2022 assembly polls. âCaste and communal politics have been dragged to their extreme end and when that happens, such issues fail to enthuse people. Employment is a major issue in UP, as are farmers and corruption. If one looks at issues like law and order, caste, Covid corruption, AAP has played the role of the Opposition in these matters and there is positivity among people towards the party,â he said. As an example, he said, when Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited UP a few days earlier, he had come to speak about education but was stopped by the government because it had no foundation in development issues to debate on. âWe will speak on our agenda of water, power and education. Religion is oneâs personal belief and politicizing it is not right. UPâs people have to decide. We will give them free power and education. If we convince them about our agenda then they will vote for us,â he said. Expressing confidence about AAPâs chances in UP, Singh said that BJP is currently going through a phase of deep dissatisfaction with at least four to five power centres including two deputy CMs and the entry of Modi aide AK Sharma. âWhat does it say of a party whose 200 MLAs sit in protest against their CM at the Vidhan Sabha. AAP is likely to get some advantage from BJP's internal fight. Secondly, the so called established parties of UP like SP, Congress or BSP are not playing their role of the Opposition, a space which we have occupied successfully over the past few months,â Singh said. AAP, which is still in the process of developing its organization in UP, will be banking on party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the elections. However, Singh says that it will not be a disadvantage for it. âEvery party has a leader and our leader is Kejriwal. In Delhi, there are 17 MLAs who have UP links and all of them will campaign here. In 2017, when Yogi Adityanath became chief minister, BJP fought the election in Narendra Modiâs name. BJP fights all elections, even local ones, on Modiâs name so why should we have a problem,â he said. He added that the recent spree of joinings in the party, including a large section of Congress and SP members, would only strengthen AAP at the grassroot level. Adding that the party still had a long way to go to have a strong organization in place, it had managed to achieve significant progress over a short period of time. "
"CHENNAI: A day after actor Rajinikanth said no to electoral politics, his confidante and founder of Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam Tamilaruvi Manian, who was urging the Tamil superstar to enter politics, too called it quits. ""I am quitting politics and will not re-enter till my death,"" Manian said in a statement. ""I involved myself in politics drawn by K Kamaraj in my college days. My only wish was to change the way politics is conducted in Tamil Nadu, where it has been muddled for long by the two Dravidian parties. I never sought any personal gain and continue to stay in a rented house,"" Manian said. ""Politics has become the home for those who indulge in caste, religion and community-based approach and not for the honest. People have started abusing me now, for my attempt to change the way political discourse happened, and it has hurt and shocked my family members,"" he said, while thanking all those who worked with him in Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam.

"Bolpur: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday urged people to reject BJPâs politics of narrowmindedness, hatred and divisiveness that pits people against each other, stressing she would never do anything against peopleâs interests. âPeople are my only family. I have no other family,â she said after walking in a 4km roadshow from Bolpur Lodge crossing to Bolpur bus stand outside Visva-Bharati campus. Urging people to lodge police complaints if they spotted âoutsidersâ, she also targeted the Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor for allegedly toeing a BJP line. Citing the Bengali lullaby, Borgi elo deshe, Banerjee said: âYou have heard about Borgis. In childhood, mothers used to sing it to put us to sleep. Deshe Borgi aasche. Rajje borgi assche (The invaders are coming to the countrysides. The invaders are coming to the state). You have to save Bengal from outsiders.â âI have never done politics to hurt people. I will never do it,â she added. âThey are only coming for the elections now. They never came before. They only know two things â fake and hate. They will make people fight against each other.â She then said: âIf you see outsiders in your neighbourhood, lodge a police complaint. If police refuse to take a complaint, write the complaint yourself, drop it in the police station letter box and mark a copy to us.â âPeople in villages, beware of outsiders. Out of 10 people, every 2 are outsiders. They will tell you about BJP, break Bengalâs spine and flee after polls,â she added. In a direct attack on VB authorities, Banerjee, without naming anyone, said: âCouldnât they find anyone else to be Visva-Bharatiâs vice-chancellor? I am not angry, neither do I have any grievances. But they had to bring him. He is a hardcore BJP loyalist. Why do BJP leaders spend so much time in the VCâs chambers?â âDirty and fanatical politics is going on revolving around Visva-Bharati. This politics of hate is being brought to Bengal,â the CM said. âTo know Hindu religion, you need to know Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Rabindranath Tagore. It is not that easy.â Targeting her detractors, the CM said: âThey are handing out money for elections. Take the money but reject them in the ballot boxes. They believe they can buy a few MLAs, that too a few rotten ones. They do not understand that Trinamool Congress isnât small any more; it has grown into a huge banyan tree.â The CMâs roadshow drew several thousands on to the streets. A week back, Union home minister Amit Shah had held a roadshow in a part of this stretch from Dak Bungalow More to Chowrasta. On Tuesday, apart from Trinamool supporters following Banerjee, people â mostly women and children â were seen waving at her from their balconies. The CM expressed gratitude to people for attending the roadshow. Local Trinamool leaders claimed rally participants were locals â unlike in the BJP rally â and most came spontaneously. "
"CHENNAI: Days after being discharged from Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad, actor Rajinikanth on Tuesday said he would not take the political plunge and launch a political party.

"Kolhapur: Most of the ward reservation and restructuring-related suggestions and objections raised by the workers of various political parties pertain to the change in reservations.The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is flooded with suggestions and objections as the deadline to submit them is close. The last date for submission is January 3.Pandurang Adsul, a senior political worker has raised objection to the process adopted for reserving wards for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe category. He said the descending order of the wards based on scheduled category population was in the wrong order. In a letter to KMC, he said the size of the population should be the criteria for reserving wards. This issue was raised during the reservation process held a week ago, where Avinash Sanas, the deputy secretary of the election commission, said population percentage of a particular category has been taken into account, not population number.Sadatkhan Hamidkhan Pathan has demanded the ward number 42, which has been reserved for the backward category, be made general as the population of the backward category is 15% of the ward.Dinkar Lakshman Kamble has objected to the restructuring of ward number 62 and wants it to be kept intact as voters from some sub-wards have shifted to nearby wards.The civic authorities will register their answers against each of the objections raised. The report will be submitted to the state election commission, which will also register its opinion over it and ask the civic authorities to make changes in case objections and suggestions is valid."
"Baharampore: Amid speculation over his political career, Trinamool Congress leader Suvendu Adhikari â flanked by his followers (Dadar anugami) â made his public appearance in Murshidabad at a ânon-political platformâ on Sunday. While he refrained from any political statement, the state transport minister sought blessings of the people in Murshidabad for âsevak Suvendu Adhikariâ. He was present at a memorial programme for Mofizuddin Mondal, a zilla karmadhyaksha who passed away little more than a month back. âHis family members told me they have organized a programme under a non-political platform. I wanted to pay my tribute to him,â Adhikari said. Despite an organizational meeting called by the district TMC president and lawmaker Abu Taher, the memorial service had a significant presence of district leaders and office-bearers. Trinamool leaders, however, chose to ignore Adhikariâs presence at the ânon-political platformâ or the posters by âDadar anugamiâ. âHe holds a crucial ministry and has been performing duties diligently,â said a TMC leader. âSuvendu Adhikari is integral to Trinamool. We have been fighting together for long and Mamata Banerjee has been our main inspiration,â said Serampore MP Kalyan Banerjee. Both BJP and Congress maintained a measured narrative. âI have been listening to rumours about him for the past six years. I have seen some banners but I am not sure of what they are trying to do,â said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. âI have been to Nandigram... It is unfortunate that Trinamool chose to leave them behind. There is nothing wrong if he revolts,â said Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury. "
"Jaipur: The ruling party legislators are getting impatient over the delay in ministerial reshuffle and political appointments.The erstwhile BSP legislators, who had merged with the Congress ensuring a comfortable majority, have been expecting some rewards in the form of ministries and political postings for a long time.Unhappy with the delay in political appointments, leader of the group Rajendra Singh Gudha, said, âWeddings are enjoyed when one is young, what is the point afterwards?âHe was referring to the delay as the state government had already completed two years.

There were also several vacancies in various commissions and constitutional bodies."
"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth finally ended the suspense over his political foray on Thursday and said he would launch his political party in January. A formal announcement would be made on December 31, Rajinikanth said, taking to twitter and ending a more than 24-year wait of his fans. âWith the massive support of people, we will capture power and provide a corruption-free and transparent government that will be above caste, creed and religion,â Rajinikanth said in a tweet. âChange. We will change everything. Miracle and wonder will happen. If not now, then never,â Rajinikanth tweeted, taking a leaf out of a campaign that his fans have been running over the past few months on the same slogan. As political buzz picked up traction, the actor followed up with a hurriedly convened media conference. âI had made it clear on December 31, 2017 (when he addressed his fans at a gathering at his Raghavendra marriage hall here) that I will surely enter politics in time for the assembly elections. In March this year, I said I wanted to see a wave and uprising from the people wanting a political change. I wanted to undertake a tour of the state to make that happen. But corona prevented that from happening,â Rajinikanth told reporters at his residence. The actor said he has already started the work for launching the party. But it requires gigantic effort and he has given the responsibility to supervise the work to Tamilaruvi Manian, chief of Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam. âDespite criticism, he has stood by me ever since I made it clear that I will enter politics,â the actor said. He also said he has appointed R Arjuna Murthy, who was in the BJP till a few days ago, as the chief coordinator. âTime to change Tamil Naduâs fate has comeââI hope you all know that I underwent a renal transplant. When transplants are done, the bodyâs immunity level is brought down. Hence, doctors advised me against going out and meeting people at large,â he said. âIf one has to face Covid, the bodyâs immunity level should be very high. I thought about it. It is because of the prayers of the people of Tamil Nadu that my life was saved when I underwent treatment in Singapore. I will be happy to give away my life for the sake of the people of this state,â Rajinikanth said seeking to drive home the point that he would campaign for a political change in the state even if it demands risking his health. âThe time to change the fate of Tamil Nadu has come. Change of government and change in politics will happen. I am only a small tool. It is the people, who have to usher in the change by extending your support. If I win, it will be your victory. If I lose, it will also be that of the people,â he said. Rajinikanth also remembered to thank the district secretaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), with whom he held a meeting this Monday, who placed his health much above his political entry. "
"MUMBAI: Maharashtra PWD minister Ashok Chavan on Thursday said opposition to the state government allowing Maratha candidates to avail benefits of the EWS quota was mere politics. The state cabinet, in a decision taken on Wednesday, allowed Marathas to apply for educational admissions and government jobs under the quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). The 10 per cent EWS quota is earmarked for those who are not covered under any social reservations. ""There is opposition to any decision being taken in this regard (reservation). This is mere politics just for the sake of opposing,"" he said. Talking to reporters here, Chavan,who heads a cabinet sub-committee on the Maratha quota, said the government had earlier planned to provide EWS quota to Marathas who have been brought under the category of socially and educationally backward class (SEBC). ""But (Maratha) community leaders like Vinayak Mete and Sambhaji Chhatra(also a BJP MP) opposed the move (on EWS quota for Marathas). ""But some groups approached the Bombay high court for EWS quota for the SEBC and the court also ruled that the government ought to have taken such a decision,"" he said. The state government has to file an affidavit in the high court on the matter on January 8, the Congress minister said. He said the cabinet decision taken on Wednesday was as per the HC directives. ""It (seeking EWS benefits) is not compulsory. Those who wish to avail can do it, but they will not be eligible for the SEBC quota,"" Chavan said. Under a 2018 state law, Marathas have been provided reservation in jobs and education under the SEBC category. However, the Supreme Court earlier this year stayed the implementation of quota for the Maratha community under the SEBC category, a ruling which has been challenged by the Maharashtra government. The next hearing of the case before a constitutional bench of the apex court is scheduled on January 25. Earlier in the day, BJP MP Chhatrapti said the state government does not seem to be confident of winning the legal battle over the issue of Maratha quota under the SEBC category. ""The state seems to have no confidence of winning the legal battle for SEBC reservation quota in the Supreme Court. If the court strikes down the state's SEBC quota law, the state government will be responsible for it,"" he said. The Rajya Sabha member said, ""The EWS quota is for everyone from open/general category, who is economically weaker. This quota is not solely for the Maratha community, but the SEBC reservation is meant for the Maratha community."" "
"GUWAHATI: The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) on Saturday, despite welcoming the Assam governmentâs decision to give land pattas to landless indigenous people, called it a âpolitical gimmick to appease a certain section of the societyâ. âWho is an indigenous? The state government has provided no such definition,â AIUDF general secretary and spokesperson Aminul Islam told TOI. He added, âIt is nothing but a political gimmick. It is also funny that Prime Minister Narendra Modi allocated land pattas to the homeless indigenous people, but never specified as to who an indigenous person is. It is part of BJPâs divisive agenda to establish the land policy, 2019, which completely violates the earlier land policies. By this, only a section of people will get land while Bengali Hindus and Muslims, and people from the tea and Nepali communities will be denied land.â The 2019 land policy, which overhauls a three-decade-old land law, allocates land to landless indigenous people without specifying who an indigenous is. Guwahati-based social scientist and the director of the North Eastern Social Research Centre, Father Walter Fernandes, told TOI that normally, the local sub-division officer gives out the pattas and the fact that the Prime Minister is distributing land-allotment certificates has become a âbig jokeâ now. âThey are trying to create a new tamasha out of it. The land is their right which should have been handed over to them long ago. There is a serious problem in the land laws of Assam which are very ambiguous. And what makes it more dangerous is that they are using this very defective system to get votes,â Fernandes said. He added that the new land policy will marginalise lakhs of poor tribal people and ethnic minorities. Human rights lawyer Aman Wadud, while welcoming the governmentâs step, asked as to why âonly one kind of peopleâ were getting land pattas. âIt is nothing but appeasement politics. The state canât create different categories of citizens as it is against the Indian Constitution. The landless â both Muslims and Hindus â who have lived in the riverine area of the state for long should get the land pattas irrespective of religion, caste or creed,â Wadud added. "
"AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Friday rejected an application filed by the Gujarat Congress working president Hardik Patel for temporary lifting of a bail condition prohibiting him to leave Gujarat so that he could attend important political events in Delhi and brief his lawyers in the Supreme Court. Earlier this year, the court had imposed the condition that Patel cannot leave Gujarat without prior permission from court while granting bail after his arrest for skipping court hearings in the 2015 sedition case. Rejecting Patelâs request, additional sessions judge B J Ganatra said that he is a political leader and if he feels like meeting and consulting with other leaders and for this a meeting is required, it is advisable to arrange online meeting or virtual meeting in this time of corona. The court also noticed that Patel had not supplied any schedule of meetings that he had to attend. The court also observed that Patel could not say whether there is any election declared in the country. The court also did not accept Patelâs argument that he needed to brief his lawyers about pending Supreme Court cases. It said that he had not supplied details about listing of his cases. The court made it clear that Patel can go out of the state and the court would permit, if it finds the reasons genuine for his visits. Moreover, the court refused to accept the assurance given by Patelâs advocate that he would not breach any bail condition and remain present during court proceedings. The court said that it has full respect for the lawyer as an office of the court, but he cannot take guarantee for his clientâs behaviour. Patel is facing a trial for sedition charge for the violence that took place during the Patidar reservation movement in 2015. "
"DHAR: Six persons were injured in a clash between Congress and BJP workers in bypoll-bound Badnawar town of Dhar on Sunday night. Two of them are in critical condition. Police have registered a case of attempted murder against six persons. Badnawar police station in-charge CB Singh told TOI that after campaigning ended on Sunday evening, they received information about a clash between two groups. On reaching the spot, they found six persons, who had returned from campaigning in rural areas, injured and two cars damaged near Chopati square. The injured were taken to Civil Hospital where doctors referred two of them to Dhar district hospital. Singh said that on basis of statements of the injured, six persons â including former nagar panchayat president Abhishek Modi and block Congress president Niranjan Singh Pawar â were booked under IPC 307 and other sections. Congress IT cell district president Ashwin Patidar, former corporator Sajid Khan, Tinkoo and Arjun Chohan were also among those, who were booked under IPC 307 and other sections. Congress Dhar president Balmukund Singh Gautam accused BJP of using police and administrative machinery to win the election. âWe will protest against it,â Gautam said. Dhar BJP chief Rajeev Yadav said: âI think they (Congress) have accepted defeat, and such reactions are a result of their frustration.â "
"BERLIN: Germany midfielder Leon Goretzka evidently doesn't believe the increasingly outdated adage that sports and politics don't mix. The 25-year-old Bayern Munich player has gained a reputation as an ethical campaigner for taking stands against racism and anti-Semitism. Now, he's taking aim at the far-right Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) political party for its continued opposition to coronavirus restrictions. Infection rates across Germany are higher where the AfD enjoys its biggest support, particularly in the eastern state of Saxony. âThe corona-crisis in particular made it more obvious what kind of party this is. For me it's no alternative, but a shame for Germany,â Goretzka told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday. âSchande fÃ¼r Deutschlandâ (shame for Germany) was trending on Twitter in Germany late Sunday, likely due to reactions from AfD members such as Malte Kaufmann, who suggested Goretzka should âshut his cheeky mouth and play football.â By Monday, âGoretzkaâ was trending, too. Goretzka told Welt am Sonntag that he had been threatened by AfD supporters for his past political statements. âBut above all there has been a lot more encouragement. You have to fight against this opposition in order to improve something. We have to make it clear to people that we live in a democracy that can't be destroyed by anything or anyone. Hate comments tend to make me position myself even more clearly,â Goretzka said. In March, Goretzka and Bayern teammate Joshua Kimmich launched their âWe Kick Coronaâ fundraising campaign to help social and charitable organizations continue their work through the pandemic. They donated 1 million euros ($1.2 million) and encouraged others to contribute more than 5 million euros ($6.1 million) in total. In August, the fund contributed 75,000 euros ($92,000) to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp memorial in Poland. The funds facilitated an exhibition on athletes deported to Auschwitz and an international conference on remembrance, education and dealing with wrongdoing incorporating racism and intolerance today. Goretzka said at the time that it's ""a matter close to our hearts to help ensure that the culture of remembrance is upheld even in the corona pandemic.â Goretzka had already visited the Dachau concentration camp memorial near Munich in February, posting pictures on social media with the hashtags âNie Wiederâ (never again), and âNeverForget.â Last month, Goretzka met 99-year-old Holocaust survivor Margot FriedlÃ¤nder in Berlin. FriedlÃ¤nder is the author of a book entitled âVersuche, dein Leben zu machenâ (Try to Make Your Life) based on her experiences as a child, when she was arrested while on the run in Berlin and brought to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic. âDespite all the suffering she experienced, she has remained such a positive person. She says she loves people,â Goretzka told Welt am Sonntag. âAfter what Ms. FriedlÃ¤nder lived through, it's actually unimaginable. She even brought her Jewish star (yellow badge) along. These are moments that you literally freeze.â Goretzka said FriedlÃ¤nder told him as he was leaving that âwe have to be the ones to make sure that something like this never happens again. That's her mission, that's why she fights every day.â "
"THANJAVUR: Union Minister VK Singh on Sunday said the on going protests by farmers against the three Central farm laws was ""more political"" in nature and underlined the NDA government's intent to ensure the welfare of the ryots. Speaking to reporters here ahead of his interaction with farmers, the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways claimed that ""actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months."" He sought to allay fears on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and other issues, saying MSP will carry on while contract farming will only benefit the farmers. ""Lot of misconceptions are being given where farmer issue is concerned. Farmers all over India mostly are happy, actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months,"" he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured the benefit goes to the farmers, Singh said, adding, ""the present agitation actually is more political than about farmers."" Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting for the last 25 days outside Delhi against the recently enacted three farm laws, with five rounds of talks with government so far failing to break the deadlock. Singh further said that other political parties, whether Congress, AAP or the NCP led by Sharad Pawar, all of them wanted that farmers should have the freedom from the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) and ""they didnt want them tied up to these mandis."" He said Modi has the ""highest regard"" for the farm sector and assured the government was with the farmer and pointed out at the various schemes including insurance and soil card to benefit them. ""The government wants the farmer, who feeds the nation, to feel protected, to get the benefit of the government's protection so that his income can be doubled,"" he said. ""...the farmer must understand that there are people who are misleading them and that is why I have come here to explain to our farmers that things are good, not as being given out by people,"" he said. The legislations in question aim at protecting the farmer and one of them says the farmer is free to sell his produce anywhere he wants with ""India being one market"" for him, Singh said. ""This is beneficial to the farmer since he can get better price.. what happens in the mandi is price is decided by the middlemen, the commission agents,"" he said. The farmer has now been ""freed from this,"" but some were insisting ""we want the mandis."" ""Mandis are going go stay. No problem in that. A voice is raised on Minimum Support Price. The bill (Act) says minimum support price will stay,"" Singh added. ""So this misconception that has been created in the minds of our farmers friends needs to be taken away,"" he said. On contract farming, he said the government has ensured the farmer gets the benefit irrespective of the price fluctuation and is especially in a position of advantage when the prices go up. ""Land is free from this contract and is provided protection...the farmer is provided protection from any exploitation by a contractor,"" the minister said. Singh later tweeted he attended a Kissan Sammelan Programme here. ""Having interacted with people here, one can feel that farmers are excited about the #FarmBills2020 brought by the @narendramodi government and feel that these historic reforms were long due. #GenerallySaying,"" he said in the tweet. He further tweeted some political parties,""to hide their historic incompetence,"" were adamant on misleading farmers about bills which will bring welfare and prosperity to them. "
"MIDNAPORE: Home minister Amit Shah said on Saturday that revolutionary Khudiram Bose is as much a pride for the whole of India as he is of Bengal, hitting out at those indulging in ""narrow"" politics of regionalism. Garlanding the statue of Bose at the freedom fighter's ancestral residence here, Shah said that he has inspired the youth of the country with his slogan 'Vande Mataram' while he was hanged by the British in 1908. ""I want to tell those who are doing narrow politics in Bengal that Khudiram Bose is as much a pride of India as he is of Bengal,"" he said. The BJP leader said that those indulging in politics of regionalism should overcome it. Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and other leaders of her party have often accused the BJP of bringing in ""outsiders"" to West Bengal ahead of assembly elections, likely in April-May next year.

"LUCKNOW: A day after Samajwadi Party (SP) sprang a surprise by supporting an independent MLA as the 11th candidate for 10 Rajya Sabha seats, the spotlight remained on party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday too following rumours that Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs who rebelled against the party candidate earlier in the day were in touch with SP. By late evening, sources in SP confirmed BSP MLA from Mungra Badshahpur constituency (Jaunpur) Sushma Patel and her husband had met Akhilesh and one more senior BSP leader was seen moving with an SP MLC in the latterâs SUV. The MLC in question is a close aide of Yadav. BSP MLA Aslam Rainee, the rebel who led the four MLAs against the party candidate, denied meeting Akhilesh but said he would surely reach out to him and CM Yogi Adityanath, if they invited him over a cup of tea. âWhen I was unwell, they called up to enquire about my well-being but my party leadership never did. I will certainly go to meet them if they invite me over a cup of tea,â Aslam said. On Tuesday, the focus of RS elections shifted on SP when the party extended support to independent candidate Prakash Bajaj who filed his nomination signed 10 SP MLAs as proposers. His candidature was however rejected on Wednesday on techincal grounds. "
"Aurangabad: The state home department on Wednesday amended the earlier GR meant to withdraw political cases against activists, and has said that the cases registered prior to December 31, 2019, may also be withdrawn. The extension of the cut-off date will pave way for the withdrawal of cases registered against political functionaries and workers, especially those from Congress and NCP, who were in the opposition between 2014 and 2019. Earlier, on March 14, 2016, the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led state government had issued the GR that allowed the withdrawal of similar cases registered May 2005 and November 1, 2014. That decision led to the withdrawal of hundreds of cases against members of the BJP and Shiv Sena, who had been in the opposition during the stipulated time period. Authorities said these cases are withdrawn using special powers granted to the state under section 321 of the CrPC. However, cases involving casualties as well as losses to public and private properties of over Rs 5 lakh are not considered. The proposal to withdraw the cases is prepared by a high-power committee comprising commissioner/superintendent of police along with the district collectors. These committees have been instructed to regularly hold meetings and send a monthly report to the state government. The proposals are then sent to the state-level sub-committee for forwarding it to the state for further action. Additional director-general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh said, âWe already have the data on the cases registered. In the light of the amended GR, we will compile the data in specific categories afresh.â The cabinet sub-committee, formed under the ministry of finance and planning by the previous government, too has been withdrawn. The state home minister has been appointed the competent authority to recommend the case withdrawals. The state is already in the process of withdrawing non-serious cases linked to the Maratha quota and Bhima-Koregaon incident, said an officer. The demand for withdrawing the cases against those protesting against the now-scrapped Nanar project, farmer related protests, NRC and Aarey project have been made for almost a year. "
"NEW DELHI: While ballot is being cast in Kashmir for the penultimate phase of District Development Council (DDC) elections, votes are being counted in Kerala for the civic polls on Wednesday. At both these places, the BJP has experimented with inclusive politics. In Kashmir, where Muslims are in a majority, the BJP has sent senior party leaders for campaigning. On the other hand, in Jammu, where Hindus are in a majority, the Hindus leaders are canvassing for the party candidates. According to the 2001 census, the Kashmir Valley had a population of 54.77 lakh. While Muslims constituted 97.16 percent of the total population in the Valley, Hindus were a mere 1.84 percent. In the Jammu region, the total population according to the 2001 census was 44.30 lakh, out of which Muslims constituted 30.69 percent while Hindus were 65.23 percent. Former Union minister and BJPâs national spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain has been camping in the Kashmir Valley for the past 25-odd days and campaigning in favour of the party candidates. Union minority welfare minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi also campaigned for the BJP candidates in the Kashmir Valley though he did not camp there. In Jammu, where Hindus are in a majority, Union ministers including Smriti Irani and Jitendra Singh canvassed for the BJP candidates. The DDC elections, which started on November 20, are being held in eight phases. Six phases are already over. The last phase of polling is on December 19. Counting of votes would take place on December 22. The elections are significant as they are being held for the first time after Article 370 was nullified in December 2019. The same trend was witnessed in Kerala as well. The BJP banked upon its Christian and Muslim leaders for the civic elections. The BJP deputed three of its leaders from Kerala itself and all belonging to the minority communities - national vice-president AP Abdullakutty, a Muslim; and national spokesperson Tom Vadakkan and Rajya Sabha MP KJ Alphons, both Christians. According to the 2011 census, 54.73 per cent of Kerala's population is Hindu, 26.56 per cent Muslim while 18.38 percent Christian. Christians and Muslims together constitute 45 per cent of the total population while the remaining 55 per cent are Hindus. Moreover, in an unprecedented development, the BJP put up over 600 Muslim and Christian candidates - 112 Muslims and 500 Christians - for the panchayat, municipalities and corporarion elections which were held on December 8, 10 and 14. The three leaders said the outreach to the minorities was to send across a signal that the BJP is a national inclusive party, to shoot down the alleged propaganda of the Congress and the Left parties that the minorities will not support it, to respect the sentiments of the Muslim and Christian community leaders for contesting these elections and to expand its base in the southern state which faces assembly election in the next six months.

"Amidst the ongoing political fiasco in Rajasthan, which culminated in the removal of deputy chief minister and PCC president Sachin Pilot from his ranks, one cannot help but draw parallels with similar political disorders in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and look into the law to understand where the lacunae lies. Public projection by rebel MLAs of withdrawing support to the state government is not the first attempt of its kind and certainly not the last. The history of what is now known as âpolitical defectionâ can be traced to the days of the Montford Reforms, but most conspicuously highlighted by the infamous case of Gaya Lal who crossed the floor of the house several times within a fortnight, which provided the impetus to push for a law on anti-defection. In the wake of the need to curb the evil, a âCommittee on Defectionsâ was constituted in 1967 under then Union home minister YB Chavan to study the ills of political defections, which noted that the lure of office played a dominant part in decisions of legislators to defect. The committee recommended that a member should be bound to the party under whose aegis he/she wins the election and therefore such a defector should be barred from holding a ministerial post. Accordingly, through a Constitutional Amendment, the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution was introduced which disqualified MPs and MLAs who voluntarily give up their party memberships or disobey party directives. While the law punished disloyalty to the party, neither did it prohibit renunciation of membership of the legislature, nor post defection ministerial appointment. Even under subsequent constitutional amendments, while post defection ministerial appointments were restricted till such time the remainder term of the member expired or he was re-elected to the House, whichever was earlier, there was no bar to resigning as MLAs or MPs. As a corollary, with reduced strength of supporting members, the council of ministers can be shown to lack the support of the House. There is, therefore, a need to resolve the issue by making suitable amendments to the law to prevent resignations as MPs and MLAs as a means to circumvent the law and prohibit post defection ministerial appointment for at least 5 years so as to discourage the thoughts of changing political allegiance.

"PATNA: Decks have been cleared for expansion of the recently formed cabinet in Bihar and the same would take place in near future, chief minister Nitish Kumar said here on Monday. He, however, debunked speculations in a section of the media during the course of the day that it was likely to take place on Tuesday. ""Not tomorrow......you do not worry we would duly inform people in advance. I cannot say whether it will take place after two days or ten days. But, it will be sooner rather than later"", Kumar told reporters who approached him with frenetic queries about cabinet expansion. The state cabinet can have up to 36 members and at present it has only 13, besides the chief minister. Kumar had been maintaining that the same did not take place for want of a 'prastaav' (proposal) from the BJP which has the largest number of MLAs in the ruling NDA. NDA sources say that there had been a tussle between Kumar and the BJP over the issue of representation of his JD(U) and the saffron party. While the BJP is said to have been demanding a lions share, Kumar is said to have been keen on a formula in which the saffron party and the JD(U) had equal representation. It has been the contention of the JD(U), which had been the senior coalition partner in the state until the assembly elections, that it has not lost its support base as evident from its vote share and that the steep decline in its tally was to be blamed on the rebellion from LJP headed by Chirag Paswan whom the BJP failed to rein in. On Sunday evening, state BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal, accompanied by deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi both from his party had called on Kumar at his official residence where the differences over the issue appear to have been ironed out. The formula agreed upon by the two parties was, however, not known. The NDA in Bihar has altogether four constituents BJP, JD(U), former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhis Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and Bollywood set designer turned politician Mukesh Sahnis Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). At present, the BJP has seven members in the cabinet, including the two deputy CMs while the JD(U) has only four, besides the chief minister. Manjhi's son has been accommodated from HAM while Sahni has been made a minister despite having lost his seat in assembly polls. The BJP has given Sahni the legislative council seat vacated by former state minister Binod Narayan Jha, who has now become an MLA. Sahni filed his nomination for the council seat during the day. Speculations are rife in the political circles that BJP national spokesman Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, who has been fielded by the party in the by-poll on the legislative council seat vacated by former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, could get a berth in the state cabinet.  When a question in this regard was posed to Hussain by the media persons, he refused to make any direct comment and merely said as a disciplined soldier of the BJP he has always been obeying party's order.

"TIRUPATI: Elected representatives and officials attending the meeting of the Andhra Pradesh assembly privileges committee at Sri Padmavathi guest house in Tirupati were taken aback when Nagari YSRC legislator and APIIC chairperson RK Roja literally 'cried' for attention by accusing officials of resorting to protocol lapses. The actress turned politician complained to the privileges committee chairman Kakani Govardhan Reddy that she was being sidelined by officials who were blatantly flouting protocol norms. She also alleged that she wasn't being invited to TTD programmes and meetings and that she wasn't getting the respect she deserves as an MLA. The ruling party MLA also flagged some development works related issues concerning the Nagari assembly constituency which she represents. Speaking to reporters, Kakani Govardhan Reddy said RK Roja brought some protocol related lapses to the committee's notice and that the matter was immediately resolved after Chittoor district collector Dr Narayana Bharat Gupta assured to sort out the protocol related issues. ""She also brought some development works related issues concerning the Nagari assembly constituency which needs to be addressed at the state level. We will take all these issues to the notice of the state government"", asserted the Privileges committee chairman. "
"BELAGAVI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said with Narendra Modi as Prime Minister and BS Yediyurappa as chief minister, Karnataka has a double engine government to drive growth in the state. ""With Modi at the Centre and Yediyurappa in the state, Karnataka has a double engine driving its growth and development on all the fronts. With political stability, the state is set for progress in the coming years,"" said Shah in Hindi at a public rally in Karnataka's Belagavi, 500km northwest of Bengaluru. Addressing a mammoth gathering of over 1 lakh people in the district ground at the valedictory of the ruling BJP's Janasevak Samavesha, Shah said Karnataka had strengthened the hands of Modi and Yediyurappa by voting the party to power in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections since 2014. ""By ensuring victory of the BJP in 25 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats from the state in the May 2019 general elections, the people have ensured absolute majority for the BJP at the Centre, which enabled Modi to scrap Articles 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir and free Muslim women from Triple Talaq,"" recalled Shah. Thanking the people for the ruling party's win in 14 of the 17 state assembly by-elections held in December 2019 and November 2020, Shah said even in the recent gram panchayat elections, 55 per cent of the candidates supported by the party had won. ""I appeal to the people to ensure the party wins 75 per cent seats in the ensuing taluk and zilla parishad elections for all-round development of the state,"" exhorted Shah. Shah also lauded the Yediyurappa government for controlling the coronavirus pandemic in the state and reducing positive cases and fatality rate over the last 10 months, Shah urged the people to get vaccinated without fear. ""Do not get misguided by the Congress leaders on the safety and efficacy of the two vaccines, which are made in India. They are safe to take,"" said Shah. ""We know you (Congress leaders) cannot do anything other than protest. but at least don't stop the ones making efforts. Both vaccinations developed in India are completely safe,"" reiterated Shah. Shah, who was on a 2-day visit to the southern state since Saturday, visited the residence of late Union minister of railways and 4-time Belagavi Lok Sabha member Suresh Angadi in the city and paid floral tributes to him. Angadi died of Covid-19 at the state-run AIIMS hospital in New Delhi on September 23 at the age of 65. ""Angadi was a dedicated karyakarta (cadre) and politician who served the nation and party with utmost devotion,"" Shah told the bereaved family members. Shah also unveiled the advanced simulation centre at KLE Hospital in the city. "
"NEW DELHI: AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday claimed that BJP was just doing âdrama all dayâ and playing âdirty politicsâ. While the mayors of the BJP-run corporations have been protesting for their âpending duesâ, AAP has alleged that North Delhi Municipal Corporation is involved in a scam worth Rs 2,500 crore, which, Bharadwaj claimed, is bigger than the 2010 Commonwealth Games scam. AAP has recently levelled a series of corruption allegations in the running of the municipal corporations, where the election is due in 2022. âWhile the mayors of the corporations are sitting outside the residence of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the commissioners of the civic bodies are on leave for the past 15 days. They have left the running of the corporations to the grace of god,â the Greater Kailash MLA claimed. âIn the coming elections, BJP will drop sitting councillors and give tickets to new faces due to corruption. The party is yet to give a single answer on the allegations raised by AAP. Earlier too, we exposed how CBI had arrested a BJP councillor for taking a bribe of Rs 10 lakh. BJP did not respond to that matter either,â he alleged. Taking a swipe at the protests by the mayors and several councillors, Bharadwaj said people of Delhi were sure that the BJP-governed civic bodies would not work for them any more. âBe it sanitation work or cleaning roads or maintenance of parks or handling the monkey menace, none of these work is being done by them,â he said, claiming that Delhiites had decided to throw BJP out of power in the next polls. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called the allegation of scam baseless. âThere is a budget proposal of the north corporation commissioner to waive off South Delhi Municipal Corporationâs Rs 2,500-crore rent dues. AAP is calling this a scam, which is ridiculous and false,â Kapoor claimed. He added that instead of releasing the corporationsâ dues worth Rs 1,300 crore, Delhi government was using wild allegations to divert peopleâs attention. "
"Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday lashed out at AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying he was exploiting the ongoing farmersâ agitation to further his partyâs electoral agenda in Punjab. Amarinder said unlike the AAP government in Delhi, âwhich had been thriving on Ambani crumbs and touting its power reforms under the Reliance-run BSES as its biggest achievement,â the Congress government in Punjab had neither signed any agreement with Adani Power nor was even aware of the private playersâ bidding for power purchase in the state. The Punjab chief minister added that the Kejriwal government in Delhi was âshamelessly notifyingâ one of the black farm laws on November 23, when farmers were preparing to march to Delhi for protest. Now, they are indulging in theatrics by announcing that they would be sitting on fast in support of the farmersâ hunger strike on Monday, quipped Amarinder. âAt a time when our farmers are braving the winter cold on the roads outside your city and many of them are dying fighting for their rights, all you can think of is how to make the most of the opportunity to promote your political interests,â Amarinder said to his Delhi counterpart. The Punjab chief minister also slammed AAP Punjab in-charge and MP Bhagwant Mann saying he was making allegations without verifying facts about the power purchase situation in Punjab. He said Mann was just a comedian who no one took seriously. "
"Thiruvananthapuram: Continuing his tirade against central agencies, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said the agencies were âworking overtime for their political bossesâ. The CM said he would soon write a detailed letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard. Addressing a virtual news conference from Kannur, Pinarayi said the agencies were hell bent on putting the state governmentâs prestigious projects under the cloud of suspicion. âIn that effort, they donât bother even if the real culprits behind the gold smuggling case escape,â the CM said. âDid the government ever try to save anybody connected to the gold smuggling case? Immediately after the incident came to light, the government had asked the Centre to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated probe into the case. A letter specifying this was sent by the state government to the Centre on July 8. At that point, the government had no prejudice against the central agencies. The state had promised them all help,â the CM said. âThe agenciesâ target has become obvious now. It doesnât call for a detailed analysis to ascertain their aim,â Pinarayi said. âJust look what happened to former Union minister P Chidambaram and present Karnataka Congress president D K Sivakumar... Late Congress veteran Ahmed Patel was another person who was hounded by the Enforcement Directorate and now his son and son-in-law are also on their radar. The Punjab chief minister's son is another one. The others in the Congress who have come under the agenciesâ scanner include Priyanka Gandhi, Robert Vadra, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ashok Gehlot and others,â Pinarayi said, adding that the central agencies were overstepping and abusing their mandate to muzzle or cut to size political opponents of the BJP government at the Centre.

"PATNA: A heated exchange was witnessed here on Friday between Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and journalists when they nettled him over a high-profile murder case that rocked the state capital earlier this week. Kumar was talking to reporters after dedicating to the public the first phase of 'Atal Path', a Rs 379.57 crore elevated multiple lane road project that promises to drastically reduce traffic congestion in a major part of the city. As the chief minister began to speak about the improvement in infrastructure since he assumed power a decade and a half ago, he was interrupted by journalists who insisted that law and order has deteriorated, citing the example of a young official of a private airlines having been gunned down outside his residence in the city Tuesday evening. ""Please do not mix up the issues of development and crime,"" Kumar requested and then snapped, when reporters persisted, saying ""your projection will demoralise the state police which is doing its job. I had myself summoned the DGP and gave necessary directions"". Responding to their contention that the police was not able to prevent crime, he retorted ""does a murderer seek permission before he commits the offence? Do you have any necessary inputs to share? If so, please go ahead"". ""Bihar has one of the lowest crime rates across the country. Please have a look at other states before painting a grim picture. And do you remember how bad things were when for a decade and a half the state was ruled by pati-patni (husband and wife an allusion to Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi),"" a visibly irritated chief minister said. Some of the senior journalists said they were all too willing to share their inputs with the police but felt hamstrung as the DGP did not pick up the phone and the person receiving calls simply noted down details of the caller with the promise that the officer will call back which never happened. The chief minister then telephoned the DGP S K Singhal himself and directed him to spruce up the mechanism for communication with journalists. A hastily issued order from the state police chief ensued, enlisting mobile and landline numbers which media persons could dial to contact him. After the drama in the state capital, the chief minister left for Rajgir, a tourist spot about 110 km from here. He dedicated to the public 'Venu Van', a sprawling ancient park, said to be in existence since the time of the Buddha, which has been given a facelift by the department of environment, forestry and climate change. He also dedicated to the public 'Ghora Katora Park', yet another tourist spot in the central Bihar town, the original seat of power of the ancient kingdom of Magadh which was later shifted to Pataliputra, which is now known as Patna.

"NEW DELHI: BJP president JP Nadda on Thursday accused West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee of doing politics of appeasement and vote bank in the state. ""On August 5, the foundation stone of Ram Temple was laid. It was the wish of crores of Indians and on August 5 its 'Shilanyas' was done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji but it is very sad that on August 5 Mamata didi imposed a lockdown in the state. However, on July 31, on Bakri Eid, the lockdown was lifted. This vote bank and appeasement politics which creates anti-Hindu mindset is Mamata didi's politics in West Bengal,"" Nadda said while addressing West Bengal BJP state executive meeting via video conference. Nadda further said, ""I was happy that lockdown was lifted on July 31, but what was the cause for imposing lockdown on August 5. It is the politics of appeasement and vote bank."" ""I urge party members to make people aware of this politics of vote bank and appeasement by Mamata ji. Tell people that she does not have affection for people of the state and she does politics for the sake of maintaining her position,"" he added. The state legislative assembly elections are scheduled to take place next year in West Bengal. "
"A growing number of Tamil Nadu political parties are losing their state party status and in turn their symbols. The upcoming 2021 assembly election is crucial for the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK). If the party with Vijakant at the helm does not get the requisite votes it will lose the state party status and join an unenviable list of parties like the MDMK and the PMK that have lost state party status over the past few decades. If it fails to secure 8% vote share or 6% and two MLAs in the forthcoming assembly elections, Vijayakantâs party would lose the state party status and its poll symbol âmurasuâ would be withdrawn. Tamil Nadu, as of now, has only three state parties â the AIADMK, the DMK and the DMDK. It was with a stellar performance, by securing 7.88% vote share and 29 seats, in the 2011 general elections to the state assembly that the DMDK made its presence felt in Tamil Nadu. The party, which was launched in 2005, had 8.38% votes and won one seat in 2006 assembly polls. It did not win any seat, but got 10.08% votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, but slid to 5.19% votes in 2014 LS polls that came down to 2.19% in the last LS polls. The DMDK has not won a single seat in the polls after 2011. But by virtue of the EC rules which stipulate that the commission would review the performance of a party for continuing or withdrawing its recognition only after two general elections to the LS or state legislative assembly on the basis of which the party secured its national party or state party status, the DMDK has retained its symbol thus far. Since the party retained its state party status based on the 2011 assembly polls, it is on life-support till the 2021 general elections. Many parties across the country have gone through similar situations. Liberal amendments to party symbol rules, issued by the Election Commission (EC) on May 14, 2005, gave a reprieve to the MDMK and the PMK, which were facing the threat of derecognition owing to poor show in the polls. These parties, however, lost their state party status and symbols in later years. The PMK won 18 MLAs and polled 5.65% vote share in 2006. In the subsequent LS polls in 2009, it increased the vote share to 5.71%, but lost all seats. In 2011, the party secured 5.23% vote share and won three MLAs. Though it won an MP in 2014, the vote share slid to 4.45%. Contesting alone in 232 seats in 2016 assembly polls, it improved the vote share to 5.32%, but lost all seats and lost deposit in 212 of them. Finally, the PMK lost its state party status in 2016. Thanks to the commissionâs rule of giving preferential allotment of old symbols to political parties, the PMK managed to secure mango symbol in 2016 general elections. The MDMKâs saga has never been inspiring. Vaikoâs party secured the state party status by winning four MPs in the 1999 LS polls, but it could secure only 4.65% votes in the 2001 assembly elections and lost deposits in 205 of the 211 seats it contested. The party lost the state party status in 2010 and failed to contest in the 2011 general elections. The TMCâs story is different as it was merged with the Congress in 2002, after the death of G K Moopanar. Though G K Vasan revived the TMC by breaking away from the Congress in 2014, it never measured up to the original TMC in strength. All the parties that lost the state party status slid to a category called registered unrecognised parties that vie for one among the 198 election symbols offered by the EC at the time of polls. Across India, there are 2,301 registered unrecognised parties, which 179 â close to 8% â are in Tamil Nadu. Many of them remain only on paper and tracing their addresses would be quite a task for the EC. Strange are the names of many of them. For instance, there is an All Prisonerâs Party registered in Tamil Nadu. Another party is christened Anna MGR Jayalalithaa Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. There is one named after father and mother â Appaama Makkal Kazhagam â and another one for lovers â Indian Lovers Party â and someone has named a party as brief as Patriot. The EC has repeatedly sought powers to deregister political parties for acts of omissions. Many of them remain only on paper, said former Chief Election Commissioner N Gopalaswamy. âThe Supreme Court, in 2001, said the EC has powers only to register parties and doesnât have powers to deregister them, because the law does not permit it. Since then, every CEC has been writing letters to get the law amended to give powers to deregister political parties as well. But the government is not acting. If you have powers to do, you should have powers to undo too,â said Gopalaswamy. Still, the EC, in 2017, released a list of political parties that were deregistered between February and December of 2016 as they did not contest in any polls from 2005 to 2015 as per the commissionâs records. Inquiries by the respective state chief electoral officers showed that some parties are no longer in existence. Interestingly, of the 255 parties that were delisted by the EC, 37 â about 15% â were from Tamil Nadu. Email your feedback with name and address to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com "
"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanthâs entry into politics continued to draw mixed reactions from political parties. Some were skeptical, some diplomatic and some downright rude. When his reaction was sought, AIADMK deputy coordinator K P Munusamy said, âSome individuals are being projected by those who longed to put an end to the Dravidian movement.â Minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji, known to drag himself into controversies, rejected suggestions that there was external pressure on the actor from the BJP to launch a party. At Kolathur in Chennai, DMK president M K Stalin said anyone could enter politics as it was their democratic right. âLet him (Rajini) launch a party and announce his policies. I will comment then,â he said. Asked about reports of Rajinikanthâs key political advisor, Tamilaruvi Manian telling the actor not to align with the DMK, Stalin said he did not receive any such information. At a party meeting in Tiruttani, Munusamy said the Dravidian movement had been steering Tamil Nadu for five decades and certain elements were continuously striving hard to destroy it. âWhat were these actors doing when Puratchi Thalaivi (Jayalalithaa) was ruling the state. Were they brave? Did they have the courage? Did they show any intention (to launch a party). They trembled when they heard our leaderâs name,â Munusamy said. Efforts are being made by some to project these actors in a bid to end the Dravidian movement, Munusamy said. Bhalaji took a dig at the media for dragging the BJP into Rajinikanthâs political entry. âCanât he think for himself ?â the minister asked, adding that everyoneâs objective was to defeat arch-rival DMK. DMK women wing secretary M K Kanimozhi said actor Rajinikanth cannot split the DMK votes in the upcoming state assembly election. While touring in Thondamuthur and Coimbatore North assembly constituencies as part of Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural (Stalinâs voice for a new dawn) programme, the DMK leader said she would comment when Rajinikanth starts his political party. âAnyone can launch their political outfit. But they cannot split the DMK votes and it wonât affect the DMKâs growth,â she said. "
"Panaji: Goa Forward Party on Monday slammed the state government for interfering in the functioning of the police and investigations. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that Goaâs deteriorating law and order situation is the result of the governmentâs apathy and unwillingness to address social issues created by the pandemic. âGoa police should be competent to anticipate and prevent crime before it happens,â said Sardesai. âWayward political and ministerial interference in police transfers are replacing efficient officers with pliant stooges whose inefficiency will put lives and property in danger.â Sardesai said that because of the pandemic lives and livelihoods have been lost and the financially weak do not have enough to tide over the time till a vaccine is found. He said police officers are transferred or appointed based on directions from the government . "
"CHENNAI: A section of Rajinikanth fans held a rally at Valluvar Kottam in the city urging the actor to take the political plunge. While Chennai city police had granted permission to the fans to hold the protest, it had limited the number of people participating in the protest to 200 and the time allotted for the same was one hour from 11.00am. #TamilNadu: Members of #Rajinikanth's fan club stage demonstration at Valluvar Kottam in #Chennai to request the acâ¦ https://t.co/heA5iApOZR— TOIChennai (@TOIChennai) 1610251497000But fans started assembling in larger numbers earlier and started the protest.

Soon after the statement, a section of fans assembled in front of his house and staged a dharna on that day. "
"NEW DELHI: Glowing tributes were paid to B R Ambedkar on his death anniversary on Sunday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying his thoughts and ideals continue to give strength to millions. Ambedkar, known as the chief architect of the Constitution, passed away in 1956. His death anniversary is observed as 'Mahaparinirvan din'. ""Remembering the great Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on Mahaparinirvan Diwas. His thoughts and ideals continue to give strength to millions. We are committed to fulfilling the dreams he had for our nation,"" Modi tweeted. President Ram Nath Kovind said Ambedkar strived for a society based on justice and equity. ""Tributes to Babasaheb B R Ambedkar on his death anniversary. Our nation's chief architect of the Constitution, he strived for a society based on justice and equity. Let us all take inspiration from his vision and values, and resolve to imbibe his ideals in our lives,"" he tweeted. Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu paid floral tributes to a portrait of Ambedkar at the Raj Bhavan in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, an official release said. ""It is the duty of all of us to realise his (Ambedkar) dream of a socio-economically inclusive democracy,"" Naidu tweeted. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said Ambedkar gave the nation a futuristic and all-encompassing Constitution that paved the way for development, prosperity and equality. âI bow before Babasaheb on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas, who gave the nation a futuristic and all-encompassing Constitution that paved the way for development, prosperity and equality in the country,â Shah said. ""Following the footsteps of Bababsaheb, the Modi government is committed to work for the welfare of deprived sections who have been excluded from the development process for decades,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said working to make India free of all forms of discrimination is the only truthful way to pay homage to Ambedkar. ""Today we remember Dr Ambedkar's contribution to nation building. Working to make India free from all forms of discrimination is the only truthful way to pay homage to him,"" Gandhi said in a tweet. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said Modi has made significant contributions to get global honour for Ambedkar. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done the work of developing places associated with Babasaheb, and linking the future generation with his philosophy,â Adityanath said. ""Whenever there will be deliberations on independence, equality, justice, and friendship, Babasaheb's name will be taken with respect,"" he added. Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray paid floral tributes to Ambedkar at 'Chaitya Bhoomi', the Constitution architect's memorial in central Mumbai. The Governor and the chief minister visited the Dalit icon's memorial at Shivaji Park in Dadar area and paid respects to him. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and state Energy Minister Nitin Raut were also present. NCP chief Sharad Pawar too paid respects to Ambedkar at his memorial. Later, in a tweet, he lauded Ambedkar for giving the nation its constitutional values. Last month, Thackeray had said that people should not congregate at Ambedkar's memorial on his death anniversary this year considering the COVID-19 crisis, and pay their tributes from wherever they are. He had also welcomed the Mahaparinirvan Din Coordination Committee's appeal to Ambedkar's followers that they should not come to Mumbai on December 6 given the prevailing pandemic situation. Every year, thousands of people from across the state converge at 'Chaityabhoomi' on December 6 to pay respect to the country's first law minister. Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati recalled the efforts of the socio-political reformer and jurist to establish an egalitarian social system. In a series of tweets and a release, Mayawati said Ambedkar worked hard all his life and faced all sorts of struggles. She hailed his role in drafting the Constitution. The BSP president also hit out at the opposition for questioning the various projects constructed in the name of Ambedkar when her party was in power in Uttar Pradesh, saying they were a small gesture to acknowledge his contributions. Mayawati went on to describe the BSP as the ""sole representative party"" of the humanitarian movement of Ambedkar. Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and other leaders from the state too paid tributes to Ambedkar. ""Remembering Baba Bhimrao Ambedkar, the father of the Indian Constitution, on Parinirvan Divas,"" Mishra tweeted along with a photograph of Ambedkar. The chief minister said Ambedkar's ""principles and work will always be an inspiration"". Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje tweeted, ""Dr. Ambedkar's principles, ideas and his personality are the inspiration for all of us. He fought against lifelong social injustice and instilled a sense of harmony in the society."" Congress leader and former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, state BJP president Satish Poonia and other leaders paid respects to Ambedkar. A wreath laying programme was held at the state Congress headquarters in Rajasthan while floral tributes were paid to Ambedkar's portrait at the state BJP office. In Tamil Nadu, Governor Banwarilal Purohit paid floral tributes to a portrait of Ambedkar at the Raj Bhavan in Chennai. Chief Minister K Palaniswami hailed Ambedkar as a ""social justice revolutionary"" and lauded his efforts to end untouchability. DMK President M K Stalin also paid homage to Ambedkar and hailed him as ""this century's new Buddha"" and a guide to all. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar said Ambedkar's philosophy, thoughts and ideals continue to inspire and give strength to the people of the country.

"KOCHI: Green politics and conservation of environment has become a prominent topic in election campaigns in some of the places in the district. Many areas in the district are facing the consequences of the pollution caused by industries or quarries and people have come forward to support green politics in such places. In Parakkadavu grama panchayat, Kathikkoodam Action Council, a forum which has been fighting against the pollution caused by a factory at Kathikkodam, has fielded its own candidate in one ward. âWhile we have fielded Jeena Sabu as the candidate for ward 13, we have a couple of candidates supporting our cause in both LDF and UDF. We expect that this will help strengthen our agitation against the pollution caused by the Nita Gelatin factory. The entire Chalakkudy river has been polluted as waste water from the factory is being discharged into the river,â said Kathikkoodam Action Council leader Jaison Panikkulangara. In Maradu municipality, M J Peter, a leader of Ayani Thodu Samrakshna Samithi, is contesting elections from ward number 12. âRampant encroachment upon Ayani Thodu and its tributaries is one of the major reasons for waterlogging in the area. In ward 12, at least 400 families, who constitute around 90% of the total families in the ward, are suffering from waterlogging during rainy season. We have been raising protest against the encroachments and unscientific manner in which canals are being constructed,â Peter said. âWe decided to contest the civic polls as political party leaders turned a deaf ear to our demands,â he said. In Elamkulam division of Kochi corporation, K T Cheshire, an environmental activist, is taking on the candidates of both the LDF and UDF. âAuthorities have taken no steps to evict the encroachments on the backwaters. I have lodged more than a dozen complaints with various courts and legal bodies like ombudsman and vigilance demanding eviction of encroachments,â Cheshire said. âKochi corporation authorities constructed a bund reclaiming backwaters under the cover of Padmasarovaram project. This has been causing waterlogging in the area. Similarly, they reclaimed 803 puzhapuramboke (waterbody) at Elamkulam for helping a housing society floated by affluent people. It is to question such deeds of the authorities that I am contesting the civic polls,â he said. In Ayyambuzha near Angamaly, residents are protesting against the Gift City project mooted by the government. âThe authorities are trying to acquire hundreds of acres of agricultural land. However, we have decided not to part with our agricultural land. So, we have been conducting strike in our area against the project. We havenât fielded our own candidates. But, we will cast our votes in favour of those supporting our cause,â said Jose Chullickaran, convener of the action council formed by the residents. "
"Lucknow: UP minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh on Saturday accused the Opposition of misleading farmers and using them to regain lost political ground. He accused the Opposition parties of only pretending to champion the cause of farmers even though they were the real reason for their plight since independence till 2014. It was only when Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he said, that farmers were given priority. With no resolution to the farmersâ protests in sight, the ongoing budget session of Parliament has also been affected with Opposition parties demanding a discussion on the stand-off between the government and farmers. âThe government expedited implementation of projects that were pending for several decades by putting them under irrigation scheme. It was the PM who implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and not Congress that sat over the report for years,â Singh said. Enumerating activities undertaken by the state government for farmers, Singh said that farmers are getting 1.5 times the cost of their crops while procurement of seeds and fertilisers has been made much easier. He added that both the PM and chief minister Yogi Adityanath were committed to doubling the income of farmers and, therefore, farmers were in a much better situation currently than they were in the past when they were exploited by successive governments who used them as vote banks. âIn the Union budget, special attention has been given to improving condition of villages and farmers. This year, Rs 40,000 crore has been allotted for rural infrastructure while there is plan to have 1,000 modern mandis. The Prime Minister Ownership Scheme will also ensure that villagers have authentic ownership papers for their properties which will deter the practice of illegal occupation of land or properties and facilitate loans for rightful owners,â he said. "
"Kanpur:Taking a dig at the opposition, senior BJP leader and Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said âgumrahi (misleading) gangâ is conspiring to hijack farmersâ agitation and doing cheap and dirty politics over it. âThis âgumrahiâ opposition with its âconspiracy type suitcaseâ, is using the shoulders of the farmers to fire its own gun and trying to defame the country,â said Naqvi while addressing reporters at Circuit House here on Saturday. He further said, âsuch conspiracy contractors are trying to spread misinformation and have always been defeated by the people of this country.â âThe people of the country, however, have rejected all such characters comprising of criminal conspiracies and political hypocrisies of some elements having vested interests, and have expressed trust in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,â said Naqvi. He added, âThese are the same elements who have been creating ruckus on the so-called intolerance in the country, raising questions on surgical strike on Pakistan, created confusion over CAA, and opposed steps taken for the well-being of people during the Covid-19 pandemic.â He also attacked international Pop star Rihannaâs tweet, wherein she extended support to the protesting farmers. âTo prove our honesty, we donât need a certificate from any international celebrity or organisation,â he said. âItâs peopleâs mandate which helped win BJP-led NDA in 2014 and then in 2019. The people have supported the policies of the Prime Minister by supporting the BJP in assembly, panchayat and local bodies elections in different states and union territories,â he said. Naqvi said the Union Budget 2021-22 is a gazette of the glorious path of âAatmanirbhar Bharatâ and will ensure development with dignity of cross-sections of the society. "
"BENGALURU: Tamil superstar Rajinikanth will not click in the southern state's politics, where the ethos of Dravidian culture has always manifested, senior Congress leader M Veerappa Moily claimed on Friday. The former Union Minister recalled that the Congress could not get ""independent existence"" in Tamil Nadu and always aligned with either the AIADMK or DMK. ""I don't think the Rajinikanth politics will click because the ethos of Dravidian culture has always manifested in the politics of Tamil Nadu,"" Moily, who was in-charge of Congress affairs in Tamil Nadu several years ago, told PTI. ""Any political party in Tamil Nadu cannot survive without the affiliation to a Tamilian party, regional party,"" the former Karnataka Chief Minister said. Rajinikanth, Moily said, has already given an impression that he is more or less aligned with the ""ideals"" of the BJP, adding, ""that's why it (his party) cannot take-off."" ""Unless Rajinikanth again nurtures himself from out of the ethos of Dravidian culture, I don't think he will have any (political) future,"" he said. Rajinikanth announced on Thursday he would launch a political party in January 2021 to contest in the Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. "
"Bolpur: State fisheries minister Chandranath Sinha raised the âcut-moneyâ issue at a Trinamool Congress public meeting on Tuesday, days after party leader Udayan Guha harped on the subject. The minister, while criticising Trinamool workers for not involving the panchayat sub-committees while implementing the work plan, said: âWhy arenât you giving importance to the sub-committees? You are not involving sub-committee members because your share will get reduced. We thus stand a divided lot while the RSS is gaining ground.â According to party sources, the Trinamool MLA from Bolpur is not happy with âthe ways of the partyâ under Anubrata Mondal in Birbhum. There is a rumour that the partyâs Birbhum president may try to field his daughter from Bolpur in the coming assembly polls. In such a situation, Sinha may get a Trinamool ticket from neighbouring Murarai constituency. "
"PATNA: The Election Commission has doubled the base time for political parties for election-related programme on Doordarshan and All India Radio (AIR) in order to encourage contactless campaigning in Covid times. A lottery was held at the office of the chief electoral officer of Bihar on Monday night for allotment of airtime to the political parties. The political parties would get altogether 2160 minutes on DD and AIR each for the election campaigning from October 15. BJP has been allotted the maximum 427 minutes, followed by RJD 343 minutes, JD(U) 323 minutes, Congress 182 minutes, LJP 157 minutes, RLSP 125 minutes, BSP 119 minutes, CPI 109, CPI (M) 98, NCP 97, National Peoples Party and Trinamool Congress 90 minutes each. Additional chief electoral officer Sanjay Kumar Singh on Tuesday told TOI that the minutes allotted to each political party were calculated on their performances and several other factors in past elections. âItâs not that the parties can run whatever campaign as per their wish. The contents of the campaign will undergo scrutiny and have to be as per the model code of conduct,â he said. DD (Bihar) programme head Dr Raj Kumar Nahar said after their screening committee approves the scripts, the programme is recorded and then aired at the time slot allocated to the political parties. âPolitical parties will not have to pay for running the election campaigns on DD or AIR. Party representatives are handed over coupons for airing their programmes,â he said. "
"NEW DELHI: On a day when 15 MPs from different political parties tried to reach out to the protesting farmers at Ghazipur border, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) - umbrella body of the unions opposed to the central farm laws - on Thursday reiterated its stand of being apolitical but said the support of political parties to this movement was welcome. âThe support of political parties and leaders to this movement is welcomed, but in no case, the SKM's stage will be allowed for political leaders,â said Darshan Pal, farmer leader and one of the working group members of the Morcha. Though it has been the stand of the SKM right from the beginning ever since they gathered on Delhi borders on November 26 last year, farmer leaders on condition of anonymity shared that they cannot outrightly tell the political leaders not to come at protest sites at a time when their support is actually needed to make the agitation a pan-India movement. They also privately recognised the importance of the left parties-linked farm organisation, All India Kisan Sabha, in carrying forward this movement with the help of the group's ground-level cadre. âThe leader of any political party is not allowed to speak from any stage of SKM,â said Darshan Pal. His remarks could be seen as an attempt by the Morcha to guard the movement from allegations of it being funded by political parties and carried out at their behest. âThis movement is completely farmers movement and we oppose all the baseless allegations against the farmers,â said Darshan Pal on behalf of the SKM. Fifteen MPs including SADâs Harsimrat Kaur Badal, NCPâs Supriya Sule, DMKâs K Kanimozhi and Tiruchi Siva, TMCâs Saugata Roy, and leaders from RSP, IUML and National Conference on Thursday visited Ghazipur. They were, however, not allowed by the police to cross the barricades and reach the protesting farmers who were gathered on the other side of the fence at the protest site.

Many of the political leaders including Rashtriya Lok Dalâs (RLD) Jayant Chaudhary, Delhi deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Partyâs (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut earlier visited the Ghazipur protest site and met the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on different days in the past six days.

"BENGALURU: BJP legislators demanded more funds for the development of their constituencies on Monday as they met chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who sought to dispel notions that he was inaccessible. The round of pre-budget meetings began in the morning, with many BJP MLAs expressing concerns about dissatisfaction among their constituents over pending works. âThe discussions were informal, but we did put forth our views on the lack of funds for constituencies. We hope the chief minister takes note of it and increases funding for development works,â said a BJP MLA from the Mumbai-Karnataka region. Other MLAs echoed the sentiment, asking Yediyurappa how the government planned to move forward. âIn most of the meetings, the shortage of funds was the main worry. We explained to them that the pandemic had dried up our resources and that the first challenge was to revive the economy,â said a minister, who was part of the deliberations. Yediyurappa reportedly told party MLAs that considerable allocations for development works would be made in the new budget, expressing confidence that Karnatakaâs economy would bounce back. In a sign of tension in state BJP, disgruntled voices like Umesh Katti, Veeranna Charantimath and Murugesh Nirani were unusually withdrawn and quiet during the meetings, according to party functionaries. For the past few months, Yediyurappa has been battling speculation that the BJP high command plans to replace him. The delayed cabinet expansion has further complicated matters. Though senior BJP figures have repeatedly said that Yediyurappa would complete his full term, the chatter about leadership change has not died down. After Mondayâs meetings, all senior ministers avoided commenting on what was discussed with MLAs. "
"CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanthâs associate and Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam founder Tamilaruvi Manian on Tuesday said the actor could not enter electoral politics now, but has not said he would never enter politics. He has also not disbanded the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM), Manian said in a statement. âIf tomorrow Rajinikanth says he is entering politics, Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam will associate itself with him on his journey. If Rajinikanth does not enter politics also, it will continue to function as a sister organization,â Manian said. Interestingly, this was the first statement Manian made after December 30, 2020, when he had announced that he was quitting politics forever and would never return until his death. His statement came a day after Rajinikanth expressed his inability to enter electoral politics by launching his own party on December 29, 2020. âPolitical forces are trying to wean away RMM functionaries. While some of them have joined other parties, several others are looking for sanctuaries like migratory birds. While I do not want to fish in troubled waters, the partyâs general council will meet on March 7 in Tirupur,â Manian said. "
"JAIPUR: The Supreme Court on Monday postponed the hearing on the Special Leave Petition filed by BJP MLA Madan Dilawar to January 7. Dilawar challenged the high court order dated August 24 asking the assembly speaker to decide on the merger of the six former BSP MLAs with the Congress on merit. The apex court asked lawyer representing Dilawar why the SLP was filed in the apex court when they could have appealed in the high court itself against the decision. A single-judge bench of Justice Mahendra Kumar Goyal, while disposing of the writ petition filed by Dilawar, asked him to approach the assembly speaker. Dilawar had challenged the merger of six MLAs â Sandeep Yadav, Wajib Ali, Deepchand Kheria, Lakhan Meena, Jogendra Awana and Rajendra Gudha â with the Congress illegal. The high court order on August 24 held that the merger allowed by Speaker C P Joshi does not fall under the category of a âdecisionâ setting aside the plea of BJP MLA Madan Dilawar to declare the merger illegal. It reasoned the order dated September 18, 2019, cannot be held to be the decision on the claim of merger by the six BSP MLAs. The six MLAs had contested and won the 2018 assembly elections on BSP tickets and defected to the Congress in September 2019. The MLAs applied for merger on September 16, 2019 and the Speaker issued an order on September 18, 2019, without a hearing of the party, it was alleged. On August 4, the BSP and Dilawar filed a petition in the high court seeking immediate stay on the merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress. The BSP had also prayed to suspend the effect of the order of assembly speaker dated September 18, 2019, whereby he declared that six elected representatives of the BSP have merged with the Indian National Congress. The BSP had maintained that the merger was unconstitutional because the party did not merge with the Congress neither at the national level nor state level. As per law, parties merge, not legislators. "
"JAIPUR: The Congress government, which discontinued former BJP governmentâs popular meal scheme âAnnapurna Rasoiâ and relaunched it as Indira Rasoi, seems to be caught on the wrong foot. The scheme was launched at a time when the government was facing a major financial crisis and it has failed to become as popular as the government would have wanted it to be. Annapurna Rasoi was introduced by former CM Vasundhara Raje on December 15, 2016. It was launched amid fanfare and was touted as a flagship scheme of the Raje government. The budgetary allocation of the scheme was kept at Rs 245 crore per year. It hit a dead end with the formation of new government in December 2018. It was relaunched on August 20 to mark the birth anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. It was renamed as Indira Rasoi or Indira Kitchen after former PM Indira Gandhi and the rules were rehashed to project it as free from corruption. Raje expressed her anger over the move and called it an act of âvengeance.â News reports claiming that rasoi vans were not seen at designated places and questionable food quality has given the opposition a fresh ammunition to attack the government. âWe understand that the name of the scheme was changed by CM Ashok Gehlot to please the Congress family. But the problem is that they have failed to serve the purpose of delivering the food on time and at the right place. Soon after relaunch, the scheme ran into trouble as several mobile vans stopped delivering food. The menu has been slashed and due to poor quality of food it is not finding takers,â said BJP state president Satish Poonia. He challenged the state claim of providing meals to 1.50 lakh persons every day. Justifying the renaming of Annapurna Rasoi to Indira Rasoi, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas told TOI that his party had brought fundamental changes in the scheme to provide relief to over 4.5 crore people per year. âUnlike the BJP which had a centralised food preparation system, the food is being prepared at several places in order to provide fresh and hot meals. Every day, the food passes through rigorous quality checks. I invite BJP leaders to eat food from any place before they question its quality,â said Khachariyawas. "
"HYDERABAD: With thousands of farmers continuing their protest against the Centre's new agri laws, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said they were for the welfare of farmers and called their agitation apolitical. Speaking to reporters, he said, ""The new farm laws are meant for the welfare of farmers. After a long time the farmer is going to come out of a locked system. Whoever wants to oppose it politically let them do it. I have never said the farmers protest is political and would never say (that it is political)."" Shah has already appealed to the protesting farmers to shift to the Burari ground in the national capital to stage their protests and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. Replying to a query, Shah also criticised AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi over his reported remarks on what action the NDA government had taken over charges that Pakistanis, Rohingyas and Bangladeshis were illegally staying in Hyderabad. Shah asked Owaisi to give in writing on removing those staying illegally to initiate government's action against them. ""When I take action they (Owaisi and other parties) create ruckus in the Parliament. Have you not seen?"" he asked. ""Let them once give me in writing to expel Rohingyas and Bangladeshis.. then I will initiate action. It should not just be a speech limited to elections. ""When there is discussion over the matter in the Parliament, who takes their side? the people of the country know it,"" Shah added. During the poll campaign for December 1 city civic body polls, both AIMIM and BJP had engaged in heated exchange of statements over alleged presence of illegal migrants inthe Old City here. "
"JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleged that the BJP has been indulging in negative politics. The statement of many BJP leaders on corona management and the future of the government has lowered the level of political discourse. Gehlot said opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria predicted that the life of the current government is only for six months, while former minister Arun Chaturvedi said there is all chance of a mid-term poll in the state. Union minister Arjunlal Meghwal said the state government has become shaky and Jaskaur Meena said for money the MLAs could go to any direction. The chief minister said these reflects an anti-democratic thinking of the opposition, Gehlot said in a statement. The BJP leadersâ statements indicate that the BJP is trying to destabilize the government by using money and muscle power, he alleged adding that the BJP tried it earlier also but due to the unity and commitment of Congress MLAs they had to face failure. He said the video of the Congress MLAs who joined BJP in Gujarat establishes that the MLAs were paid Rs 10 crore on joining the BJP. Gehlot said the opposition party is indulging in this kind of activities when the state government efforts in Covid management has been appreciated all over the country and by the prime minister himself. But the BJP leaders in the state has been trying to frighten the people with their scare-mongering statements which was very unfortunate, said the chief minister. He said the corona cases were shown an increase in the state due to increased interaction of the people during the Diwali festival, cold and marriage season. tnn "
"CHENNAI: Even as the state braved a cyclonic storm, it is back to politics for parties, including the ruling AIADMK, considering there is hardly any time for the May 2021 assembly election. DMK chief M K Stalin is scheduled to resume the virtual public meeting âTamilagam Meetpom (Retrieve Tamil Nadu)â on November 29 in Tirupur and on December 2 in Krishnagiri. DMK youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin will continue his suspended campaign âVidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural (Stalinâs voice for awakening)â in the delta region from Saturday. âIt will all be indoor meetings and interactions with targeted audience such as coconut farmers,â said a close associate. Poll strategists are evolving plans to set the narrative. âRetrieve Tamil Naduâ campaign was held in 53 out of 77 party district units so far, covering several lakh cadres and voters and will be completed by mid-December. âThe virtual campaign is effective, which is why our leader wants to continue it.

Since it is not restricted to cadres, the public also get to see the leader at close quarters and enjoy his speech,â DMK MP T K S Elangovan said. In his hour-long speech, Stalin hits out at the AIADMK-BJP combine for their alleged misdeeds, corruption and anti-Tamil policies. The Krishnagiri meeting may be put off by a few days given the new weather formation in the Bay of Bengal. As for the AIADMK, besides cyclone relief work, the ruling party hopes to strengthen its base by appointing members for its young men and womenâs wing, a 25-member booth level womenâs committee and inclusions in the votersâ list. âWith ministers and senior leaders being appointed as zonal in charge, meetings continue to pep up cadres,â said a senior minister. Meanwhile, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam took a dayâs break and attended marriages of party functionaries in Salem and Theni before returning to Chennai.

"BENGALURU: Expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala was discharged from a hospital here on Sunday after recovering from Covid-19, days after she was set free by the prison officials on completion of her jail term in a corruption case, authorities said. Sending a strong signal, Sasikala, a close aide of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, travelled in a car that sported the AIADMK flag from the hospital, with the ruling party questioning the propriety of her action when she had been ousted from the party. The AIADMK has time and again made it clear that the 66- year old Sasikala would not be taken back and her release would not have any impact on the party, which is keen retain power in the assembly elections, expected in April-May. It has already declared incumbent K Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate for the polls. Sasikala was expelled from the party in September, 2017 along with her nephew TTV Dhinakaran and others by the general council of the combined AIADMK under the leadership of Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam after the two merged their respective factions. On Sunday, the AIADMK in its twitter handle said the use of its flag by Sasikala was against the law and quoted senior party leader D Jayakumar. ""How Sasikala, who is not even a party member could use the party flag? This is against the law,"" Jayakumar, who is also the Fisheries Minister, said. Defending Sasikala, Dhinakaran, who is the general secretary of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam floated by him in March, 2018 as an arrangement to retrieve the AIADMK, claimed ""she (his aunt) is the general secretary of the AIADMK."" Cases relating to her so-called 'expulsion' and connected matters were pending before the court in Tamil Nadu, he told reporters, adding ""I have already told you that legal fight will continue (to retrieve the AIADMK)."" The very purpose of floating the AMMK was to retrieve the AIADMK in a democratic way and 'Thiyaga Thalaivi Chinnamma' (leader of sacrifices, junior 'Amma') would continue legal efforts to win back the party, he said. Dhinakaran said as per doctors' advice she would stay back here and take rest for a week before returning to Chennai. Political analyst Sumanth Raman tweeted ""#Sasikala coming out of hospital in a car with an AIADMK flag on it seems to be a clear signal of her intentions. Game on."" Soon after she was discharged, Sasikala reached a resort near the scenic Nandi Hill at Devanahalli in North Bengaluru. Sasikala was admitted to the Victoria Hospital after she tested positive for COVID-19 recently while under judicial custody. Prison authorities here had formally released her on January 27 after she completed the four-year jail term in a Rs 66 crore disproportionate assets case. On the advice of doctors, she remained in the hospital and was discharged on Sunday after her latest test reports came negative for Covid-19, hospital officials said. A huge crowd of her supporters greeted Sasikala as she came out of the hospital. More than 300 police personnel were deployed in the area to ensure law and order, police said. Sambasivan, one of her supporters from Hosur in the border district of Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu, told PTI that this was like a festival for him. Sasikala's release comes ahead of the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and the course of action taken by her would be keenly watched. The Supreme Court sentenced her to four year simple imprisonment on February 14, 2017 at a time when she was set to take over as the chief minister subsequent to her election as the AIADMK legislature party leader. After the sentence that also barred her from contesting elections for six years after completion of the term, she chose Palaniswami to be the chief minister. Before coming here to serve the sentence, Sasikala had made a dramatic vow at the 'samadhi' of Jayalalithaa, though she did not openly declare what it was all about. "
"HYDERABAD: Away from the political rallies, voters across greater Hyderabad are giving voice to another campaign, fast gaining ground on and off social media. Their concerted appeal: Say no to hate. Despite differences in political ideologies, people from across social strata and background say they are concerned over the discriminatory tone of contesting parties â getting louder in the final lap of campaigning. âCampaign for the GHMC elections getting hotter by the day. And bitter too,â posted Mahesh D, summing up the sentiment of a large section of the electorate. Another long-time resident, V B J Chelikeni Rao, said: âItâs the first time I am seeing a local election being fought like this.

"NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged on Thursday a scam in the distribution of bio-decomposer for preventing burning of paddy straw in Delhi and demanded a CBI inquiry into it.  Khera claimed that Rs 10 crore was spent on advertisements of Pusa bio-decomposers by the Kejriwal government, while the actual cost of distribution of it was Rs 23.60 lakh, including Rs 75,780 as cost of the solution.  No reaction was immediately available from the government or the ruling AAP.  ""We demand a CBI inquiry into this scam of Pusa bio-decomposer, initiated by the so-called revolutionary chief minister of Delhi,"" Khera said in a press conference held at the party office.  He also alleged that despite the claim that the solution would decompose paddy straw, it failed to do so.  The Delhi government adopted the bio-decomposer developed by the Pusa Institute of Technology and arranged its free-of-cost sprinkling at around 800 hectares of fields where non-Basmati rice is cultivated to prevent burning of paddy straw by the farmers.  Citing RTI replies, Khera claimed that 1,200 farmers applied for the bio-decomposer but only 310 in 39 villages could get it from the government.  The AAP government held paddy straw burning in neighbouring states as main source of rise in air pollution in Delhi during winters and strongly advocated use of Pusa bio-decomposers to check it. "
"HYDERABAD: The Congress on Sunday urged governor Tamilisai Soundararajan not to turn Raj Bhavan into a den of politics. âI agree that Raj Bhavan should not be an adda for politics, but the governor should also not indulge in politicking and have a partisan attitude,â AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan said in a letter to the governor. âOn the pretext of a coronavirus pandemic, the governor did not give an appointment to the MPs, MLAs elected by the people. But she gave an opportunity to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to meet her. Going with this, it is clear that the governor, TRS and the BJP are working as one team,â said Manickam Tagore, AICC general secretary in-charge of Telangana. âThe governorâs decision not to allow AICC in-charge Manickam Tagore, TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy, and others to submit a memorandum against the centreâs farm bills was definitely a political decision,â Sravan told a media conference after releasing the copies of the letter sent to the governor. âWe respect you and people are happy with your working style. But you refused to meet our leaders, citing fear for Covid-19. You didnât even allow us to meet the public relations officer or even agree to leave the memorandum at the gate of Raj Bhavan. You didnât allow us to do so and you got us arrested,â Sravan said. âThe governor should be apolitical but you made fun of us by calling our efforts a drama. You as a governor should also not play politics,â he said. He also wondered how Tamilisai Soundararajan and her husband allowed CM KCR to visit them to congratulate and felicitate Soundararajan on receiving the Dronacharya award. âYou were photographed with the chief minister without maintaining physical distancing, comfortably forgetting the fear of Covid-19,â he alleged. "
"Vadodara: Godhra, the ground zero of 2002 Gujarat riots, could also be the ground zero from where the Asaduddin Owaisi led AIMIM tastes some success in its debut in Gujarat. This seems to be a distinct possibility not only because of the high minority population in the town but also because the BJP and Congress have not been contesting on the minority-dominated wards in the municipal election there.Godhra where the 2002 Sabarmati Express carnage took place triggering riots across the state has seen an unstable and inefficient municipality. It has 11 wards that elect 44 councillors most of whom are independents. Out of the 44 seats 20 seats are in the five wards in minority-dominated areas. Since BJP and Congress did not field candidates here, all the corporators from here were elected as independents in 2015. Five members of the majority community were elected on other seats in the town taking the tall of independents to 25. The BJP won on 18 seats and Congress won on one seat.The AIMIM, expectedly, has become active in these circumstances. State general secretary of the party Abdul Hamid Bhatti said that persons from Godhra had been in touch with the party since quite some time. âWe are set to contest the polls from Godhra and will put up a good show and even be in a position to establish majority,â said Bhatti. He added that five former corporators had already joined the party and many others would do so in the coming days.But the AIMIM is willing to give tickets to persons from other wards too. âPresently, we are collecting profiles of probable candidates. We want to contest on all seats in 11 wards,â said Hanif Kalandar who leads he party in Godhra."
"AYODHYA: AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisiâs statement that the Ayodhya mosque on 5acre land was âharaamâ (un-Islamic) has triggered an unprecedented bonding between Hindus and Muslims, who unitedly criticised what they called âpolarisation agenda of the Hyderabadi politicianâ. Cementing communal harmony and holding aloft Ayodhyaâs syncretic moorings, clerics and seers called out Owaisi for trying to create rift to serve his politics. Talking to TOI, mahant of Tapaswi Chavni, Paramhans Das, said, âI strongly advocate construction of the mosque in Ayodhya. Offering prayers cannot be illegal anywhere as every part of the world was created for worship of God. Also, the proposed land is not disputed and mandated by Supreme Court. Owaisi is trying to create confusion with rhetoric and building walls between communities.â Muslim representatives also objected to Owaisi's statement. One of the oldest litigants in the Ayodhya title suit, Iqbal Ansari, said, âOwaisi has no right to call anybody âmunafiqâ (hypocrite) or âzaalimâ (tyrant). He will face tremendous opposition from Muslims when comes to Uttar Pradesh to seek votes. The proposed 5acre land is not in any manner a barter or an exchange. We fought a prolonged legal battle, but lost. Supreme Court on its own gave the land for building a mosque,â he said.Another prominent Ayodhya cleric, Mukhtar Ahmad, said, âOwaisi is not a mufti (Islamic legal authority). How he can issue a fatwa that the land for proposed mosque is haraam (un-Islamic). He has no right to term anyone munafiq or zaalim.â "
"PATNA: The unexpected meeting of all five MLAs of Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM and the lone MLA of Chirag Paswan-led LJP with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar here on Thursday, especially ahead of the cabinet expansion in the state, has triggered a strong speculations in political circles that these MLAs might change their loyalty and join the ruling JD(U) in days to come. Political analysts says they are giving more weightage to the speculation this time because the Bahujan Samaj Partyâs lone MLA in Bihar, Mohammad Zama Khan joined the ruling JD(U) only last week after having a âsimilar meetingâ with the CM at the latterâs official residence at 1, Anney Marg, here. Soon after meeting the CM, Zama Khan went to the residence of the JD(U)âs state working president and education minister Ashok Choudhary and announced his joining the JD(U). At the same venue, the independent MLA Sumit Kumar Singh also announced his support to the ruling JD(U). Sumit too made his declaration after having a meeting with the CM at the latterâs residence. Though the AIMIM state president and MLA Akhtarul Iman, who led the partyâs delegation of all five legislators to the CM residence on Thursday, claimed that they met the chief minister on the issue of âdevelopment of Seemanchal regionâ, the partyâs youth wing president Aadil Hasan told TOI on Friday that the AIMIM conveyed to the CM that âOwaisiâs party will extend support to Nitish Kumar only when he (Nitish) leaves the BJP and comes out of the shadow of saffron party.â âOur party (AIMIM) has a clear-cut stand on the issue of extending support to Nitish Ji. We will not support Nitish Kumar until he leaves the BJP. The AIMIM chief Owaisi too has made it clear during an election rally in Seemanchal region last year,â Hasan told TOI over phone. Iman claimed the AIMIM delegation met the CM to seek a special package for development of the Seemanchal region from where all five party MLAs won the last assembly election. However, a senior JD(U) leader, who did not want to be identified, told TOI on Friday that the development of Seemanchal region was just an alibi. The AIMIM MLAs met the CM with some other reasons which could not be disclosed right now. âWait for some days. Everything will be known to the public,â he said. âDuring his initial meetings with the JD(U) leaders, Zama Khan too had been giving similar excuses,â said the JD(U) leader. Hours before meeting all five MLAs of the AIMIM, the CM also had a meeting with the lone LJP MLA from Matihani (Begusarai) Raj Kumar Singh on Thursday. Singh too told media persons that he called on the CM for âsome development worksâ in his constituency. Only four days ago, Singh had visited the residence of the JD(U)âs state working president Ashok Choudhary during a book launch event. During a conversation with media persons, the lone LJP MLA had categorically said that the CM Nitish Kumar is the NDA leader in Bihar. The JD(U) had won 43 seats in the 2020 assembly polls. With the joining of the lone BSP MLA Zama Khan, its tally in the 243-member assembly has reached to 44. If five MLAs of the AIMIM and the lone MLA of the LJP follow the footsteps of Zama Khan, their move will not only increase the ruling JD(U)âs tally in the assembly, but also scuttle the RJDâs plan to form the government with the support of the smaller allies like the AIMIM, the HAM(S), the VIP and the LJP. The RJD-led Mahagathbandhan has a total 110 MLAs in the assembly. The RJDâs CM candidate Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will require at least 13 more votes to reach above the majority mark of 122. Once the five-member AIMIM changes its loyalty, it will be very difficult for Tejashwi to reach the magic figure of 122, political analysts point out. ""Thus, by luring the AIMIM team, the ruling JD(U) will scuttle Tejashwi's plan to become CM at least during the current assembly,"" a JD(U) leader said. "
"NEW DELHI: The BJP on Friday slammed the opposition parties for boycotting President Kovind's address to the joint sitting of Parliament, calling it ""unfortunate"" and noting that he as the constitutional head of the country is above political differences. Lashing out at Congress, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said its ""arrogance"" is the ""real problem"" as it believes that it is bound to rule the country despite not having the popular mandate. Prasad said the party has not condemned the violence and alleged insult to the national flag at the Red Fort during the farmers' tractor rally on January 26. Giriraj Singh, Union minister and BJP MP from Bihar's Begusarai said that the Opposition is shredding the dignity of democracy by not attending the President's address.  Meanwhile, members of various opposition parties raised slogans in Lok Sabha demanding repeal of the three new farm laws on day one of the Budget session. As soon as the House paid tributes to late Union minister Suresh Angadi and 26 former members, including Jaswant Singh, Tarun Gogoi, Motilal Vora, Ahmed Patel and Ram Vilas Paswan, members from the Congress, DMK and the Left parties entered the Well of the House raising slogans. That Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu raised slogans during Kovind's address was very painful and unfortunate, he said. A total of 16 opposition parties on Thursday announced a boycott of the Presidentâs address to Parliament scheduled for Friday, and accused the Centre of âorchestratingâ the mayhem in the capital to discredit farmers. The statement â signed by Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Mallikarjun Kharge, Jairam Ramesh, Sharad Pawar, Farooq Abdullah and T R Baalu among others â said lakhs of farmers had braved odds for over two months to protest peacefully at the Delhi borders, during which 155 farmers had lost their lives. The opposition said the controversial farm laws were an âassault on rights of the statesâ and âwill effectively dismantle the edifice of national food security that rests upon MSP, government procurement and distribution systemâ.

"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump met with US House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in Florida Thursday amid a tug of war over the Republican Party's future, with congressional leadership appearing eager to present a united front with the former president. Winning back the House of Representatives from Democrats in 2022 was the primary topic of the meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, according to a readout provided by Save America, a political action committee linked to Trump. ""President Trump's popularity has never been stronger than it is today, and his endorsement means more than perhaps any endorsement at any time,"" it said. McCarthy, an ally who encouraged Trump's baseless election fraud claims, distanced himself from the outgoing president after Trump was accused of inspiring his supporters to storm the US Capitol earlier this month. He declared that Joe Biden was the winner of the November election and that Trump ""bears responsibility for (the January 6) attack on Congress by mob rioters."" But on Thursday McCarthy appeared back in Trump's graces, as the men grinned broadly in a handout photograph taken in an ornate room reminiscent of a European palace. ""Today, President Trump committed to helping elect Republicans in the House and Senate in 2022,"" McCarthy said in a statement that also attacked Democrats for ""impeaching a president who is now a private citizen."" ""A united conservative movement will strengthen the bonds of our citizens and uphold the freedoms our country was founded on,"" McCarthy added. House Democrat Katherine Clark expressed shock that McCarthy was re-aligning with Trump after the ""seditious"" Capitol assault. Despite ""active threats of violence,"" she said, ""Kevin McCarthy's response is a photo op with the treasonous instigator."" With Trump impeached for an unprecedented second time, and the Senate girding for his trial, it was unclear how much political clout Trump would retain beyond his presidency. But recently several Republicans, following polling showing strong party support for Trump, have signaled they will remain in the brash billionaire's orbit -- or at least not publicly break with him. Pro-Trump Republicans will hold huge sway in the coming years. They are a large enough contingent to influence the Republican primaries. But should Trump be cast out and they abandon ship, the party would be severely weakened in its attempts to challenge Democrats for congressional control. ""You have the Trump wing of the party, wanting to purge those who have stood up to the president's lies, (and) you have the establishment wing of the party wanting to purge the party of Trump,"" Republican former congressman Carlos Curbelo told MSNBC. ""Right now, it's clear that the Trump wing is dominant."" "
"NEW DELHI/BATHINDA: Farmers unions agitating for repeal of the central agri laws may continue to publicly resist the presence of politicians at their platform but they are now looking for their support to take the protest forward. The development comes at a time when the chances of resuming talks with the Centre appear quite bleak and they need to keep up the spirits of their supporters. News of Delhi policeâs investigation against farm leaders since the Red Fort violence on R-Day has sent the agitationâs leadership searching for a new plan. Discouraging news from the Chilla and Ghazipur borders on Wednesday night, of cane charge and disconnection of power supply, has increased the anxiety at Singhu and Tikri camps. Confronting the taint of being called ""anti-nationals"", the frontline unionists face the challenge of lifting the protestersâ morale to keep the stir going. The circumstances had changed and the new plan must be more calculated, with marches ruled out, farm leaders said. The talks option, however, would be difficult unless unions consider forgoing the repeal demand. Though unions, barring those linked to Left parties, are weighing their words at this juncture, there are some who want to explore the option of consultations at the political level while broaching the idea of a demand of joint parliamentary committee to probe the Red Fort incident during the tractor rally. ""The movement can no longer be apolitical. After all, the demands are political in character where members in Parliament will have to step in either to repeal the farm laws or to enact a law to give legal guarantee to purchase at minimum support price (MSP). Farmersâ unions will have to take political support to reach their goals,"" P Krishna Prasad, secretary of the Left-aligned All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), said. The AIKS is represented in talks with the government by its leader and former CPM Lok Sabha member Hannan Mollah, who is also working group member of the AIKSCC, a platform which plays a key decision-making role in the farm unionsâ umbrella body Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). The entire process of talks, however, has taken a peculiar turn where most leaders who have been part of the negotiations will now have to join the police probe on the violence issue as they have been named in the FIRs. ""Talks option is always open if the unions reconsider the governmentâs proposal to take forward the discussion through a joint committee after putting implementation of the laws on hold for 18 months. Police probes can happen simultaneously. The law will take its own course,"" an official said. The farm leaders, however, want to tread carefully, given their options might be limited. They can engage in talks with the government independently but it remains to be seen if those who had, in internal discussions, expressed the desire to consider the governmentâs proposal of deferring implementation of the laws find the space to push their suggestions. Sensing the undercurrent of differences in opinion which may harm their unity, the national working group of the AIKSCC, which represents around 500 farmer organisations from across the country, on Thursday issued a statement, appealing to all the farmer leaders of the country ""to unite and not give-in to the desperate diversionary and divisive attempts."" Seeking to keep its flock together, it said, ""The AIKSCC represents the interest and concerns of its constituents and thus firmly stands with the demands of the farmer organisations agitating in unison for repeal of three anti-farmer acts, legal guarantee of MSP and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020. These are non- negotiable."" The 19-member working group of the AIKSCC includes Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Kavitha Kuruganti, Hannan Mollah, Avik Saha, Kiran Vissa, Medha Patkar and Raju Shetti. "
"NEW DELHI: Ahead of presentation of the Union Budget in Parliament, the ruling BJP on Thursday said it will be a game changer and usher in a new era of economic growth in the country. Citing a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report which projected India to grow at 11.5 per cent in 2021, BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishan Agarwal said the country's economy has witnessed a 'V' shaped recovery after being hit by the pandemic. Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, Agarwal along with the party's another spokesperson Zafar Islam said the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) figures and labour force participation also point that the economy is witnessing a 'V' shaped recovery. ""Good economics is good politics that has been the motto of the Narendra Modi government. Working with the same theme, the Union Budget 2021 will be a game changer,"" Agarwal said. Echoing similar sentiments, Islam said the budget will usher in a new era of economic growth in the country and will be an important step in making India self-reliant. Both the leaders said all economic parameters are pointing that the country's economy has gained momentum and set to move to another level under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. "
"Ranchi: JMM on Thursday named party president Shibu Sorenâs son chief minister Hemant Sorenâs younger brother Basant Soren as the partyâs candidate for the prestigious Dumka assembly constituency, the family bastion for decades. Dumka goes to the polls along with Bermo segment on November 3. Basant will file his nomination papers on October 12, the party said in a statement. Hemant had won the seat in last yearâs state polls, but he chose to retain Barhait. Basant (42), is the youngest of JMM chief Shibu Sorenâs four children. A resident of Bokaro, he currently heads JMMâs youth wing and this will be his debut into electoral politics. In the past, he has been the campaign manager for both Shibu and Hemant on several occasions. Basant, who was in Ranchi on Thursday, did not respond to TOIâs calls and messages. If Basant manages to win, he will become the fourth person from the family to have entered the state assembly. Shibuâs elder son Durga represented the Jama constituency, another legacy seat in Santhal Pargana, from 1995 to 2000 and was seen as the natural successor to Shibu, until he died at the age of 39 due to various ailments in May 2009. Durgaâs widow Sita now represents the seat in the assembly. Hemant on Thursday morning summoned his sister-in-law Sita Murmu (Soren) to inform her about the decision to field Basant in Dumka. Sita had recently accused a section of JMM leadership of conspiring against her in an open letter to party chief Shibu. JMMâs spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said, âThe decision (to nominate Basant) was taken on the basis of evaluation done by the chief minister, who is also the working president of JMM, during his three-day visit to Dumka last month. He interacted with a cross section of voters and JMM workers and sought their opinion on the candidate for Dumka.â Basant had accompanied Hemant on all his programmes in Dumka. Actively involved in politics for years, Basant had contested the Rajya Sabha election in 2016, but ended up losing to BJPâs Mahesh Poddar. Emphasizing that Basantâs fortunes will be reversed this time, Bhattacharya said, âSanthal Pargana is JMMâs home. It is the place where Guruji (Shibu) launched his movement against the mahajans and drug addiction. JMM workers in Dumka were also in favour of fielding Basant as the candidate to maintain Gurujiâs legacy.â The Dumka seat has, for the last few years, been the turf of battle for supremacy between JMM and BJP. While Hemant lost to the saffron partyâs Lois Marandi in the 2014 assembly election, he won the seat back in the 2019 state polls even amid speculations that his party has lost hold in the region as indicated by Shibuâs defeat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. âWe are hopeful that our candidate will win with a bigger margin than the assembly polls. We also hope Congress announces its candidate for Bermo soon,â Bhattacharya added. "
"GUWAHATI: Leaders of the All Assam Studentsâ Union, who have remained âapoliticalâ all throughout their lives, finally took the plunge into politics with general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi heading out to join the newly-floated Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP). Gogoi, in his last public speech as Aasu general secretary on Saturday, said a prolonged fight for an âerror-freeâ National Register of Citizens and implementation of the all-important Cause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord are on their agenda. âDue to imposition of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) by the Centre, Assamâs language, culture and political rights are at stake. In such a crucial time, our biggest concern is how to take ahead the mass movement against CAA. Our standpoint is clear â Assam wonât take the burden of even a single illegal foreigner on its land,â Gogoi added. He said all foreigners, irrespective of their religion, who entered the state after March 24, 1971, must be deported as per the Assam Accord signed with the Centre and the state government. Gogoi called upon the people of Assam to resist the âfascist forcesâ that were responsible for imposition of CAA to end the supremacy of the indigenous tribes and communities of the state. When asked about how he plans his new innings, Gogoi, without divulging much details, said, âI had decided my future course of action long ago. I had already declared my decision to hand over the charge to the younger generation. I will always do whatever is good for Aasu, and Assamâs social life and society.â Aasu central committee vice-president Chittaranjan Basumatary and chief organising secretary Raju Phukan, along with a number district-level leaders, have already joined AJP. Speculations are that president Dipanka Kumar Nath will also join AJP as he is one of the most vocal proponents of a political alternative to the BJP-led coalition. On the other hand, chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya is in a dilemma over his future. Samujjal, who is known to be the face of Aasu, had announced that he will quit the body during the Duliajan convention. However, he has taken some time as he said he âneeds to talk to his conscience following the demand of the delegates to not leaveâ. Reacting over Samujjalâs decision, AGP president Atul Bora, said, âSamujjal Bhattacharyya has sacrificed a lot, unlike many new leaders in Aasu who are after power. People can expect a lot from him. With his stature, he could easily have become an MLA, MP or minister, but he continued serving Aasu.â "
"KOLKATA: Extending solidarity to the farmers' protest demanding repeal of the three new farm laws, at least 10 political prisoners of a correctional home here started a hunger strike on Sunday. In a statement released from the Dumdum Central Jail, the protestors described the laws as anti-farmer and alleged that the BJP-led Central government passed the agri laws taking advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation. They also hit out at the BJP-led central government claiming that the laws will actually benefit corporates. Sources in the state correctional department said that eight other political prisoners lodged in Berhampur Central Jail in Murshidabad district will start fasting from Monday on the same issue. Thousands of farmers have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for nearly a month, demanding repeal of three agri laws enacted in September and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP). While the government has presented these laws as major reforms aimed at helping farmers, protesting unions have maintained these Acts will leave them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the mandi and MSP system. "
"LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused the BJP-led state government of hurting the 'foundation of democracy' by dissolving village panchayats without conducting elections for them. Yadav's allegation prompted a rebuttal from UP BJP vice-president and party's in-charge of panchayat elections Vijay Bahadur Pathak who said Yadav had been the state's chief minister and should know that the panchayat elections could not have been held amid the Covid-19. Pathak also expressed the UP government's commitment to holding the panchayat elections within six months. ""The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has dissolved the village panchayats without conducting the fresh elections for them. Major elections are being conducted, but the government has been finding itself unable to hold elections of the smallest units of public representation. How will this government run Uttar Pradesh?"" Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi on Sunday. ""The BJP must not hurt the foundation of democracy,"" the former UP chief minister added in his tweet. Rebutting Yadav's claims, Pathak told , ""Akhilesh Yadav had been the chief minister of UP. He should know that elections should have been conducted at the stipulated time."" ""He should also know that the elections have been delayed because of the anti-Covid protocol. The UP government is committed to holding elections within six months for which preparations are already going on,"" said Pathak. He also said that those who are accusing the government of not holding the elections for these ""smallest units of public representation"" had actually crushed them for their own vested interests. ""The BJP has faith in democratic values,"" Pathak said. The Uttar Pradesh has a total of 58,758 'gram panchayats' and as many panchayat heads. As per a state government notification, the five-year tenure of 58,660 'gram panchayats', barring 88 of Gautam Budh Nagar and 10 of Gonda districts, where gram panchayat elections were held later, ended on December 25. Following the expiry of terms of village panchayats, the state government has appointed assistant developments officers of districts as panchayat administrators of their districts, vesting in them the powers of panchayat committees and village panchayat heads.

"BENGALURU: Congress on Thursday sought to capitalise on the speculation that BJP is planning a change of guard in Karnataka, saying chief minister BS Yediyurappa may have to leave office after the Bihar assembly elections. At a rally, Siddaramaiah claimed he had learned from his sources in Delhi that the BJP top brass would ask Yediyurappa to step aside after the Bihar verdict. Another Congress politician, RV Deshpande, also took a swipe at Yediyurappa. âBJPâs Basanagouda Patil Yatnal was a minister in the central government. If he has spoken about the corruption in the BJP government (in the state), then it must be true. When the Siddaramaiah government was in power, BJP called it a 10 per cent administration. So, what percentage is the Yediyurappa government? If this continues, I am certain that he will have to step down,â Deshpande alleged. Meanwhile, in RR Nagar, HD Kumaraswamy of JD(S) alleged that Congress legislators created a difficult environment for him when he led the coalition government. âIt was extremely suffocating and hostile,â he claimed, adding that a legislator threw a bunch of papers on his desk and asked him to sign them. "
"SIRA: Since 1957, the Sira assembly segment in Tumakuru district has elected a Congress or a JD(S) candidate. In the past three elections, BJP was a distant third. But it has put up a stronger fight this time, making the November 3 bypoll a three-party contest for perhaps the first time in Siraâs electoral history. BJP and JD(S) have fielded political newcomers CM Rajesh Gowda and Ammajamma, respectively, whereas Congress has turned to its old warhorse and seven-time legislator, TB Jayachandra. JD(S) MLA B Satyanarayana was the sitting legislator of Sira before he died in August. The party is hoping his supporters will transfer their votes to Ammajamma, his wife. Sira, which has a sizeable Vokkaliga population, is one of the most backward constituencies in Karnataka, and BJP believes it has a good chance of winning, considering that a BJP government is at the Centre and in the state. In the past few weeks, the party has sent a number of ministers for canvassing in Sira. The campaign is led by deputy chief minister Govind Karjol and chief minister BS Yediyurappaâs son, BY, Vijayendra, who has been camping there for the past 20 days. BJP functionaries said a similar strategy produced results in KR Pete, which was considered a JD(S) bastion. Farmers in Sira grow mostly ragi, groundnut and horse gram. A severe shortage of water for drinking and irrigation has long plagued the region, and farmers depend completely on good rain. Water availability is a major talking point among electors, who expect the winning candidate to ensure adequate supply to Kallambella, Sira and Madaluru water tanks. All three parties have promised to deliver on this count by bringing water from Hemavathi Dam. 2 candidates, 1 issueJayachandra, who was the minor irrigation minister in the Siddaramaiah-led government, has repeatedly mentioned the Madaluru tank in his speeches, blaming BJP for not completing the project. âI took the initiative of starting canal works, so the Madaluru tank can get regular inflows. The project got stuck after I lost the assembly election in 2018. If elected, I will ensure it is completed,â he said. Rajesh Gowda has made a similar promise: âAs our party is in power, I will get this done, if I am elected.â The JD(S) campaign, which struggled initially, is back on track with the entry of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda, who is camping in the constituency. âBJP and Congress want to win this bypoll with the help of their money and muscle power. But we are fighting for peopleâs cause, and I am sure they will support us,â he said. All three parties have fielded candidates from the Vokkaliga communityâs Kunchitiga sect, which means neither can use the caste card exclusively. The constituency has more than 2.1 lakh voters. Kunchitgas number 40,000 and Gollas/ Yadavas 25,000. BJP has tried to woo the latter by forming Kadu Golla Development Corporation. But it hasnât worked as expected because only a few sects of the community are likely to benefit from the move. Gollas are also upset that BJP didnât give the bypoll ticket to DT Srinivas, who heads the Karnataka Golla Yadava Sangha. âThe votes of Dalits, Kurubas and Muslims, totalling about 40,000, will also hold the key,â said Enjirappa, a former president of Sira talukâs Primary Land Development Bank. "
"BENGALURU: Congress and BJP have employed contrasting bypoll strategies to build voter support in the segments where they lack a strong base. In the Sira assembly constituency, which has traditionally backed JD(S) and Congress, BJP studied the demographic data and framed its campaign messages accordingly with the hope of flipping the seat. In RR Nagar, where BJP is thought to have the edge, Congress has followed a âtop-to-bottom approachâ: Bengaluru Rural MP DK Suresh and senior legislator R Ramalinga Reddy are enlisting the support of local community leaders who enjoy respect among voters. Some Congress functionaries claimed the party had approached 9,500 to 10,000 local influencers. Those who can deliver more than 30 votes are contacted directly by Suresh and his team. The exit of the partyâs 2018 winning candidate, N Munirathna, virtually left it without a network of cadres in RR Nagar. Rebuilding this network would have taken time, so Congress opted for the said strategy. Munirathna has entered the RR Nagar contest on a BJP ticket this time. The two bypolls will be held on November 3. The campaigning ends on November 1 as per the model code of conduct. BJP and Congress started the groundwork for the bypolls two months ago. BJP sent its state general secretary and MLC, N Ravi Kumar, to Sira to gauge public mood. CM Rajesh Gowda, a new political entrant, is the party candidate here. BJP functionaries said Kumar grouped voters in three categories: people who will certainly vote for the party; people who may support it after some convincing; and those who will need a serious prod. He made the analysis based on caste, age and sex. âAfter assessing the factors, we sent teams to target each voter group,â said a BJP worker. Compared to RR Nagar, Congress is well placed in Sira. It has fielded former minister TB Jayachandra, who has a long association with the constituency. For JD(S), the challenge is to retain its Vokkaliga support base in both constituencies. It has fielded Ammajamma and V Krishnamurthy in Sira and RR Nagar, respectively. The party is banking on the appeal of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy. "
"BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa will hit the campaign trail in Tumakuru district on Friday, ending speculation that he had decided to keep a low profile this time. He will address rallies in Madaluru village and Sira town to boost the chances of BJP candidate CM Rajesh Gowda. Yediyurappa is expected to make a series of promises to voters, from extending more funds to the Sira assembly constituency to appointing bypoll winners from BJP as ministers. The latter may put him in a tricky spot as a number of cabinet hopefuls have been waiting for months. The November 3 bypolls wonât affect the governmentâs stability, but the stakes are still high for Yediyurappa as there is persistent speculation in political circles that the BJP high command is considering leadership change in Karnataka. The Sira battle may be more important to him than the RR Nagar one as his son, BY Vijayendra, is part of the campaign team in Sira. A victory will help Vijayendra strengthen his position as the state BJP vice-president and perhaps convince the top brass that he could carry forward Yediyurappaâs legacy. The chief minister will join the party campaign amid the oppositionâs claims that his government has failed to contain Covid-19 cases and indulged in corruption. During the assembly session, Congress had questioned his family membersâ alleged interference in government affairs. Yediyurappa rejected the allegations and dared opposition members to fight the elections on these issues. Earlier, there were reports that Yediyurappa, who recovered from Covid-19, may not campaign because of bad weather. Last week, he conducted an aerial survey of flood-affected districts and it was thought that hectic campaigning by road would affect his health. The bypoll battle is in the final stretch and campaigning will end on November 1. Parties are pulling out all stops to deliver their messages to voters in the two constituencies. On Thursday, there were huge BJP and Congress rallies in Sira. The Congress rally was led by DK Shivakumar. Senior BJP functionaries have been holding public meetings almost every day. In RR Nagar, deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan was conducting door-todoor canvassing for the party candidate, N Munirathna. "
"CHIKKAMAGALURU/ HASSAN: BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel claimed that some groups were involved in the attack on BJP leaders in Bantwal. Speaking to the media here on Thursday he said, âI do not comment on anyone or any particular group. It is not an isolated incident as there was no personal enmity. The incident appears to be a planned one. It was an attempt to murder. I appeal to the state government to direct the police department to investigate the matter and bring all those involved in the attack into the books. Miscreants, irrespective of their affiliations, must be arrested.â Speaking on the assembly by-election, Kateel said, âBJP has a comfortable 117 seats to run the government. Weâre not worried about the by-election. Moreover, we donât have any understanding with any political parties in the election.â âDKS should verify his previous statementsâ BJP national general secretary CT Ravi on Thursday slammed KPCC chief DK Shivakumar and asked him to check his earlier statements about RR Nagar BJP candidate Munirathna. Ravi said, âDK Shivakumar verbally attacked Munirathna while campaigning. The Congress leadersâ double-standard has been exposed by their statements.â âAccording to Congress leaders, Munirathana was a good Congressman during the 2018 election. Now he has joined BJP and has become a criminal in their eyes. Shivakumar had praised Munirathna in 2018. If he has doubts, he should check his earlier statements,â Ravi added. âWhy did Shivakumar rush to Mumbai when Munirathana and others stayed in a private hotel after expressing displeasure over their leadership? Shivakumar performed drama on the streets in Mumbai. Former CM Siddaramaiah promised a cabinet berth to Munirathna but didnât give it to him. Now he is blaming Munirathna for political mileage,â Ravi said. Meanwhile in Hassan, former minister H D Revanna has alleged that BJP and Congress have tied up to take on JD(S) in the Sira by-election. âCongress is indirectly helping BJP in the governance, and it is its leaders who are responsible for BJP to get power. The association continues in Sira by-election too,â he said, adding: âTo get to the helm of affairs in Hassan CMC, BJP has indulged in corrupt practices. The member who is set to become CMC president had contested the elections by producing a false caste certificate. We will move the court in this regard .â "
"KARWAR: Former minister and senior JD(S) leader Anand Asnotikarâs announcement on Thursday, wherein he declared his support to the BJPâs candidates in the elections to the posts of president and vice-president of the Karwar City Municipal Council (CMC) came as much as a surprise to the saffron party as it did as a shock to his party and followers. Observers of local politics are of the opinion that it is in keeping with Asnotikarâs efforts to inch closer to the ruling BJP. Rumours have been floating around for months about Asnotikarâs desire to rejoin the BJP. His efforts are allegedly being thwarted by Uttara Kannadaâs BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde. However, in announcing the backing of four JD(S) councillors in the Karwar CMC, in addition to the support of two Independents, Asnotikar is reportedly trying to garner the goodwill of the BJP top brass. Nitin Pikle is the BJPâs candidate for the post of the Karwar CMC president. In the 31-member CMC, 11 councillors belong to the BJP and Congress each. Although the BJP declared Nitin Pikle as its candidate for the presidentâs post of the CMC, dissenting voices with the party rose questioning the choice. Shilpa Naik and Nanada Sawant of the saffron party moved the Karnataka high court questioning the post being reserved for a member of the general category. They appealed to the court to direct the state government to reserve the post to a member of the backward community (A) category. On the other hand, many of the aspirants for the post of the CMC chief have raised the banner of revolt. The Congress, meanwhile, has decided to wait to see how the BJP succeeds in burying these differences before staking claim to the top posts in the urban local body. Asnotikar had, during BS Yediyurappaâs second stint as the chief minister starting in 2008, served in the state cabinet. But he was disqualified as an MLA after he revolted against Yediyurappa before the Supreme Court reinstated him as a legislator. Although he contested the assembly election as a BJP candidate again from Karwar assembly constituency, he lost to Satish Sail, an Independent, by a huge margin. Asnotikar subsequently sought the BJPâs ticket in the 2018 election but Hegde opposed his candidature and the saffron party fielded Roopali Naik. After he was snubbed by the BJP, Asnotikar contested the election as a JD(S) candidate but lost to Roopali. Asnotikar is allegedly trying to rejoin the BJP, and is reportedly seeking entry to the legislative council. The election to the top posts in the Karwar CMC is scheduled on Sunday. "
"THANE: Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Saturday said the Shiv Sena never plays politics when it comes to work ""unlike others"". ""For us, politics is limited only to elections. Once elections are over, we get back to work but others always indulge in politics. Let them do that,"" Aaditya Thackeray said while speaking at a programme at Kalyan in Thane district to launch a girder for the Patripul Rail Overbridge (ROB). ""Like this project which faced many hurdles before seeing the light of the day, other projects will be undertaken by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to ensure development of the state,"" he said. Aaditya, son of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, further said the 'Samruddhi Mahamarg' or Mumbai-Nagpur expressway project is likely to be completed next year. ""Every month we take stock of various projects, like MTHL (Trans-Harbour Link), Coastal Road, Worli-Sewree connector etc,"" he said. Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde said the Patripul ROB would open for traffic after 30 days. ""This ROB is a New Year gift for citizens of Kalyan- Dombivli,"" he added. "
"BENGALURU: Despite the prevailing pandemic, a large number of voters exercised their franchise in the biennial Karnataka legislative council elections for four graduatesâ and teachersâ constituencies on Wednesday. Political parties had expected a low turnout. Elections to four constituencies saw a collective turnout of 71% at the 5pm end of voting and political parties claimed it to be the highest ever. This is the first election in Karnataka after the pandemic struck. The South-East Graduates constituency recorded 75% voting followed by North-East Teachers (73%), West Graduates (70%) and Bengaluru Teachers (66%). In all, the fate of 40 candidates was sealed. Counting of votes will take place on November 2. Voting began on a subdued note in the morning but picked up pace after 11am. The majority of voters voted after 2pm. Voters were seen in long queues before polling stations, maintaining social distance and wearing masks. Before being allowed to enter polling stations, the voters were sanitised, and their body temperatures checked. The election commission had reserved the last hour (4pm to 5pm) for Covid-19 patients but it received a tepid response. âOnly three Covid-positive patients cast their votes,â official sources said, adding that the overall polling percentage in almost all constituencies saw a big increase compared to previous elections. âThe high voter turnout is encouraging. Safety measures were taken at all polling booths. The turnout is 30% more than previous elections to these constituencies in 2014,ââ they added. These elections are crucial for the ruling BJP as it lacks a majority in the council to pass crucial bills. The government could not pass amendment bills in the recently held monsoon session of the legislature despite getting it passed in the assembly. In the council with a strength of 75 members, Congress has 28 members, BJP 27, JD(S) 14, one independent, one chairman and four vacant seats. "
"BENGALURU: Revenue minister R Ashoka has emerged as BS Yediyurappaâs go-to man for important decisions and matters, especially the ones related to Bengaluru. In the seven months of the pandemic, he has solidified his position as a senior cabinet member after reportedly losing some influence in a political tussle over steering development policies in the tech capital. Ashoka seized some key moments to lift his brand, from overseeing Bengaluruâs Covid-19 response during the absence of K Sudhakar, now the health minister, to ensuring the appointment of revenue secretary N Manjunath Prasad as the new BBMP commissioner. While Yediyurappa officially holds the Bengaluru development portfolio, Ashoka now appears to be the de facto in-charge. After the heavy rains in the city recently, he accompanied the chief minister to affected localities and the optics suggested that he was leading the overall relief work. In the past decade, Bengaluru development has become one of the most coveted portfolios. After BJP formed the government last year, the question of who will head this department became a major point of friction among legislators and cabinet members, especially Ashoka and deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan. Finally, Yediyurappa played it safe, retaining the portfolio. After the pandemic erupted, he started relying more on Ashoka, who also enjoys the confidence of BJP MLAs from Bengaluru. âItâs very easy to approach him and he has the experience of managing people. We have a better equation with him than with some other senior ministers,â a BJP legislator said. Another MLA said that the outcome of the RR Nagar bypoll could bolster or weaken Ashokaâs standing. Ashoka is in charge of the campaign in this assembly segment. On the reported power struggle between Ashwath Narayan and Ashoka, BJP insiders said that the former had not been able to capitalise on some opportunities he got. Turf war affecting projects?Opposition parties claim the turf clash will hurt Bengaluruâs development. âThe chief minister must take a decision to hand over the portfolio to another or he should take more interest. While we cannot comment on the internal politics of BJP, the city must not suffer,â said Congress MLA and former Bengaluru district in-charge minister R Ramalinga Reddy. Ashwath Narayan said there was no tussle, insisting that Yediyurappa was in sole control of Bengaluru development. âHe is in charge of the district and its development. The BBMP commissioner and administrator report to him. However, I am involved in policy-related matters as part of my duty and service to the city,â he said. "
"VIJAYAPURA: MLA for Nagthan assembly constituency in Vijayapura district Devanand Chavan of the JD(S) has charged deputy chief minister Govind Karjol of indulging in politics of revenge. âI defeated Karjolâs son Gopal in the assembly elections and he is extracting revenge by withholding funds for my constituency,â said Chavan, accusing the deputy CM of abusing his power by interfering in the functioning of departments such as police, food and others in Nagthan constituency. âKarjol is only listening to his followers. Many projects have received the governmentâs nod, and tenders have been awarded to private companies, but officials, acting at the behest of Karjol, are not commencing work on any of them. As a result, people in my constituency have not received a single rupee in compensation despite having suffered in the flood,â Chavan added. "
"DHARWAD/ KARWAR: Contrary to the expectation, 70.11 per cent of the voters turned out to exercise their franchise in the election to Karnataka Legislative Council from West Graduates Constituency on Wednesday. In the previous election in 2008, voter turnout was 49.48%. Considering the decline in the number of registered voters and the pandemic, political observers had expected the polling percentage to be less, but they were proved wrong. Polling was peaceful, and no untoward incident was reported. Gadag recorded the highest polling at 74.59%, followed by Uttara Kannada at 71.08%. Dharwad district saw 68.65% turn out while Haveri registered 67.89% voting. Of the 74,278 voters, 52,080 of them exercised their franchise, according to the election officer. Polling, which began on a sedate note in the morning at the 146 polling booths set up in the four districts, picked up pace by 1pm. At 1:15 pm, 24.89% polling was recorded with Alnavar registering the highest of 38%. Post-lunch, graduate voters rushed to polling booths and by 4pm, the voter turnout was 57.96%. When polling concluded at 5pm, the voter turnout had reached 70.11% according to official sources. Unlike in the assembly election where the turnout of female voters is more, male voters outnumbered women in this election. While 61.54 female voters exercised their franchise, 71.93% male voters cast their votes. As the election is being conducted during the pandemic, the Election Commission had taken extra precautions to ensure neither the voter nor poll officials are infected. Thermal scanning and pulse oximeters were arranged at all the polling booths and every voter was screened. Those in quarantine or suspected Covid-19 cases cast their vote in isolated rooms reserved in every booth. Counting of votes will be held at UAS s on November 2.

"JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday accused the BJP of 'using' a Muslim leader in an attempt to topple his government while ignoring the community when it comes to fielding election candidates.  He made the charge while accusing BJP Rajya Sabha MP Syed Zafar Islam of being involved in alleged horse-trading during the revolt in July by a group of Congress MLAs led by former deputy CM Sachin Pilot.  Gehlot said ""not one ticket"" was given to Muslim candidates during the last assembly elections in the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and yet, he added, ""A Muslim was being used to bring down the government.""  But he did not elaborate on the MP's alleged role during the attempt to ""destabilise"" his government earlier this year.  The chief minister alleged that union ministers Amit Shah, Dharmendra Pradhan and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat were among those involved in the ""conspiracy"" to destabilise the state's Congress government.  Addressing a press conference here, Gehlot claimed he has proof that the state BJP leadership was also involved.  Replying to another question on Pilot's rebellion, the CM said, ""Forget and forgive"".  The Congress leadership in Delhi intervened to patch up the differences between the two factions after Pilot and 18 other MLAs rebelled.  The BJP has in the past rejected the charge against it, saying the Gehlot was blaming the opposition for a problem within the ranks of his own party.  Gehlot had called the press conference Friday to highlight the achievements of his government in the last two years.  AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra and state ministers were also present.  Reacting to the claim that his government has not fulfilled the election promise of waiving farm loans, Gehlot said the opposition is misleading people.  He said loans from cooperative and land development banks have been waived but the nationalised banks are under the Reserve Bank of India, and asked why the Centre doesn't intervene in this.  He said the state government has even offered to shell out 50 per cent of the amount involved in waivers by nationalised banks.  He accused the BJP government at the Centre not caring about the concerns of farmers who are protesting against the farm laws.  Dotasra said the party will begin on Monday a ""Kisan Samvad"" programme of meetings with farmers across the state. "
"LUCKNOW: Paying tributes to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the eve of his 95th birth anniversary, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that he was a much loved public figure, who remained connected with people whether he was in power or in the opposition. Addressing a âkavya sandhyaâ organised by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Foundation, the CM said that Vajpayee entered politics in 1957 and was active till 2006. During this time, he had a deep impact on Indian politics. âVajpayee kept the sensitivity of a poet and a writer alive even in politics. He used to say that politics should be based on values and ideals and implemented it in his life as well. He will continue to inspire people forever,â he said. The CM said that Vajpayeeâs poetry symbolised nationalism, moral values, ideals and struggles. He had a dream and it is finally being realised now. He worked as an assistant to Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee who had vowed to end Section 370 from Kashmir. That has finally happened, he said. "
"MANDYA: Illegal stone mining in Baby Betta, a hillock about 11km from Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoir in Mandya district, has triggered a political slugfest with parties blaming each other for the menace. HD Kumaraswamy of JD(S) on Sunday accused the BJP government of allowing illegal mining and claimed that he completely stopped the activity in Mandya district during his tenure as the chief minister. BJP workers countered him on social media, reminding him of allegations against JD(S) member and former minister CS Puttaraju, who owns mining units in Baby Betta. In 2017, Puttaraju was slapped with a fine of Rs 90 lakh for carrying out illegal mining on the hill. BJP workers also recounted how HD Deve Gowda protested at a mining unit in Nagamangala taluk last year after claiming that district in-charge minister KC Narayanagowda had harassed JD(S) members who were in the mining business. At the time, farmer leaders had criticised Deve Gowdaâs stance to support mining, pointing to a report by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre that highlighted the dangers of mining close to the dam and recommended a complete ban. The report drew attention to the fact that seismic activity recorded within the radius of the reservoir on September 25 was linked to blasts at nearby stone quarry units. The reservoir is the main water source of Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya and other districts. Congress and JD(S) activists on Sunday questioned the BJP governmentâs alleged failure to tackle the problem, circulating videos of an election speech in which Yediyurappa had vowed to end illegal mining in Baby Betta. The speech was made before the KR Pete bypoll in 2019. That year, mining was completely banned at Baby Betta after a study highlighted the risks. Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh raised the issue in the Lok Sabha. âIâve got reports that illegal mining work is affecting the KRS dam. I have instructed officials to take immediate steps to stop it,â Yediyurappa said on Sunday. "
"PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Even after two weeks of abrupt cancellation, the Pimpri Chinchwad administration and ruling party BJP has failed to announce the new dates for the affordable housing draw. The scheme, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), offers 3,664 flats in Charholi, Ravet and Borhadewadi for Rs7 lakh for which the civic body had received over 47,000 applications. Ruling party leader Namdev Dhake told TOI, âWe are trying to invite at least one Union minister for the draw and even if they are available online, it would be enough. We are hoping to organize it within the next 10 days.â On the cancellation, he said, âWhat happened earlier this month was very unfortunate. The administration was pressurised by guardian minister Ajit Pawar to reschedule the programme so that they could get the credit.â Civic commissioner, Shravan Hardikar, who was unavailable for comments despite repeated attempts on Sunday, had told TOI last week that the civic body was going to organize the lottery âvery soonâ.

"Jaipur: The BJP on Wednesday accused the Ashok Gehlot government of failing to execute the central governmentâs rural development schemes due to political reasons and depriving people of benefits. The opposition party exuded confidence of winning the panchayat samiti and zila parishad elections scheduled to be held later this month. Union minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal while releasing a black paper on the Congress government alleged that the state government did not implement schemes like the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojna, Shyama Prasad Mukherji Urban Mission and PM housing scheme deliberately as they were named after Jan Sangh stalwarts. Meghwal said the Congress government ignored public interest and had been indulging in the pursuit of its mutual interests, depriving the needy by disrupting the public interest schemes run by the central government. âThinking that the popularity of the BJP government (at the Centre) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is increasing in rural areas, the state government did not implement them (central schemes),â Meghwal alleged in a press conference at the party office here.

"CHENNAI: Actor Vijay has, yet again, distanced himself from the political aspirations of his father film director S A Chandrasekhar. In a public notice on Saturday, the actorâs advocate, S Kumaresan, said his client will not be responsible for rumours and any consequence that could occur to anyone through the activities of Chandrasekhar and his Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, Virugambakkam. He noted that Chandrasekhar, without his clientâs authorization, registered a political party in the name âÃll India Thalapathy Vijay Makkal Mandramâ and registered a society âVijay Makkal Iyakkamâ on June 8, 2020. On November 5, 2020, Vijay issued a public notice disapproving of the activities of his father and requested his fans to not be involved in the political party or society or a movement organised by Chandrasekhar. The notice said Vijay did not authorise the activities of Chandrasekhar and that he had been strictly intimated through a legal notice to stop using Vijyayâs name in the party/society as well as his photos in public meetings. Appropriate legal measures were initiated on the activities of the All India Thalapathy Vijay Makkal Mandram and Vijay Makkal Iyakkam, it said. "
"NEW DELHI: With assembly elections in West Bengal months away, Kolkata turned into a political battleground on the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Subhas Chandra Bose as the ruling Trinamool and the BJP went all out to appropriate the legacy of Netaji. While the BJP celebrated the day as ""Parakram Diwas"", the TMC observed it as ""Desh Nayak Diwas"". TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee kicked off the celebrations with a grand procession in Kolkata. Before the commencement of the 7-km procession from Syambazar area in the northern part of the city, Banerjee blew a conch shell and a siren was sounded at 12.15 pm, the time when Bose was born on this day in 1897. She took a dig at the BJP for remembering Netaji only at the time of elections. 'Don't insult': Mamata refuses to give speech at Netaji event after sloganeering in PM Modi's presence""We do not celebrate Netaji's birthday only in the years when elections are scheduled. We are celebrating his 125th birth anniversary in a grand fashion,"" she said. The BJP glitz, on the other hand, was led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who visited the city and spoke about the ""new India"" that is taking shape today. PM Modi wondered how this new India would have made Netaji proud. ""Netaji had dreamt of strong India, from LAC to LOC we are following his footsteps. Whenever our sovereignty was challenged, we have given a befitting reply,"" PM Modi said at an event organised at Victoria Memorial. The Prime Minister said that Netaji is the biggest source of inspiration for the dream of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-reliant India) and 'Sonar Bangla' (Golden Bengal). ""Netaji would have been proud that the government he dreamt of is fighting a pandemic with vaccines developed by it,"" Modi said. Referring to the question that Netaji had asked his nephew Sisir Bose before his daring escape from house arrest, Modi said, ""If today Indians place their hands on their hearts and feel Netaji's presence, they will hear the same question: Will you do something for me? This task is to make India self-reliant."" Noting that Netaji had identified poverty, illiteracy and diseases among the biggest problems of the country, he said the society will have to come together to solve these problems. ""Bengal needs to play an important role in the quest for Aatmnirbhar Bharat, just like the role that Netaji played in the freedom of the country. Aatmnirbhar Bharat has to be led by Aatamnirbhar Bengal and Sonar Bangla,"" he said. Hailing Netaji as the embodiment of India's power and inspiration, Modi said that the country has decided to celebrate the freedom fighter's birth anniversary as 'Parakram Diwas' to honour his indomitable spirit and selfless service to the nation. Mamata on the other hand fired several salvos at the Centre as she paid homage to Bose at his ancestral home. The West Bengal chief minister criticised the Centre for abolishing the Planning Commission, which, according to her, was conceptualised by Netaji. ""Why the national Planning Commission, which was conceptualised by Netaji in independent India, was dissolved? Why the demand for a national holiday on Netaji's birthday by our government has not been yet met?"" Mamata said in her brief speech at Netaji Bhawan. ""A monument, named after Azad Hind Fauj, will be erected at Rajarhat. A university named after Netaji is also being set up which shall be funded entirely by the state, and will have tie-ups with foreign universities,"" she tweeted. She also asked, ""Who has given the name 'Parakram'? We are celebrating the day as 'Deshnayak Diwas' here because it has a history. Rabindranath Tagore had described Netaji as 'Deshnayak'. That is why we have today used the name to link the two legends of Bengal,"" she added. (With inputs from agencies) "
"MUMBAI: The credit for the BJP's political growth in Maharashtra goes to late Bal Thackeray and the Shiv Sena, party MP Sanjay Raut said on Saturday. Speaking to reporters after paying tributes to the Sena founder on the occasion of his 95th birth anniversary at his memorial in ShivajiPark in central Mumbai, Raut said the BJP would not have been able to expand its base in rural areas of Maharashtra if Sena had not aligned with that party. ""The credit for the rise of today's BJP goes to Balasaheb. If Shiv Sena takes a different political stand in the interest of the country and Maharashtra, that doesn't mean the party has deviated from his (Bal Thackeray's) ideology,"" Raut said, in a veiled swipe at the BJP. The Shiv Sena used to be one of the oldest allies of the BJP in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) before it walked out of the fold in 2019 while accusing its former ally of not honouring a pre-poll promise in Maharashtra. In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena-BJP government had first come to power in 1995. Both the parties again shared power, though with changed equations, from 2014 to 2019 with Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP being at the helm, before they fell out after the 2019 Assembly polls on the issue of sharing the post of chief minister. Since then, the BJP has been accusing the Sena, which shares power with ideologically incompatible NCP and Congress in the state, of diluting Bal Thackeray's ideology of Hindutva for the sake of power. ""Every party needs to take a political stand in the interest of that particular state, the country and its people. What is important is staying that course and succedding...and the Shiv Sena has done that,"" he said. Raut, also the chief spokesperson of the Sena, said Bal Thackeray would have been happy with the way the Sena and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are working in the state. ""Uddhav Thackeray is a popular chief minister in India.... Balasaheb would have been happy,"" he added. Raut said that Bal Thackeray's ""ideology"" was that all parties should go beyond politics and come together in the interest of the state Several Sena leaders, including film actor Urmila Matondkar who joined the Uddhav Thackeray-led party recently, paid their tributes.

RJDâs Tejashwi Prasad Yadav led the explosion of outrage, calling it a violation of the right to free speech and daring the CM to arrest him. âIf the government, ministers or officials are indulging in corruption, why shouldnât people raise it? Why is he scared of a democratic exercise?â he said, demanding that the order be revoked immediately. NDA & JD(U) defend circular on social mediaTejashwi, who alleged that Nitish was following in the footsteps of the FÃ¼hrer, went on to dare the CM to arrest him as he had accused the BJP-led government of protecting liquor smugglers. On Thursday, the EOUâs additional director general, Nayyar Hasnain Khan, had issued a circular to all departments, asking them to report âcybercrimeâ as defined in the order so that necessary legal action could be taken against such people or entities. According to the circular, âcontinuous informationâ was arriving about some people and organisations making derogatory and misleading comments on social media against the government, ministers, MPs, MLAs and officers. âFor such acts, it seems proper to take legal actionâ¦ EOU is the nodal agency for cyber crime in the state,â it states. Khan told TOI that the communication had been misinterpreted as an attempt to curb freedom of speech. The ADG claimed the circular was meant to merely make various departments aware of the need to approach EOU in the event of social media misuse. NDA functionaries defended the governmentâs order. BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal said: âWhy should anyone be afraid if one is not posting anything wrong?â he said. JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said everyone had the right to express oneâs opinion, but the use of defamatory language or wrong information could not be allowed. CM Nitish Kumar has forgotten freedom of expression is a fundamental right. If the government, ministers or officials are indulging in corruption, why shouldnât people raise it?

Sirsa and a few others have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy). According to the FIR, the case was registered for cheating and embezzlement of Gurdwara funds up to the tune of Rs one crore by making huge unjustified payments against purchase of tents, blankets and tarpaulin from sham companies. The FIR was registered after a complaint was received against Sirsa and others by one Bhupinder Singh. Speaking to TOI, Sirsa said: âIt is a malicious attempt to ruin my reputation and a political vendetta being meted out on me like this. The alleged incident mentioned in the FIR took place when Manjit Singh GK was the signing authority and the president but strangely his name is missing from the FIR. I am aware that this is just the beginning of a failed attempt to stop me from serving farmers who are the annadata of our nation. Many such cases can be slapped to stop me but all such attempts will fall flat.â âThis is a witch hunt launched by the opponents with the support of the government but they have forgotten that it is the truth that always prevails as said by Guru Sahiban,â added Sirsa.

"Chennai: Come January 27, the ruling AIADMK-led by O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami is all set to put up a united show ahead of the assembly election. The Jayalalithaa memorial and its unveiling ahead of an election is expected to help the AIADMK leadership strike a chord with its dedicated voters. Every district secretary has been directed to make the ceremony a grand success with cadres, functionaries and the public joining the celebrations from across the state. The political leadership decided to inscribe on Jayalalithaaâs gravestone, her popular slogans that steered the party and government -- âAmaithi, Valam, Valarchiâ (peace, progress and prosperity) and âMakkalal Naan, Makkalukkaga Naanâ (By the People, For the people) in Tamil and English. The two leaders have sought to take exclusive âownershipâ of the memorial by unveiling it themselves and installing a plaque with their names etched on it for posterity. Speaker P Dhanapalâs name would find a place too. âThe memorial is an exclusive party and state government affair and the leaders would like their names on the plaque,â said a source. The state government had not been too keen on inviting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to declare it open like it was considered earlier. The iconic Rs 80 crore memorial complex will be the rallying point for the AIADMK leadership and cadres who has overcome some trying times in the last four years. The unveiling day events have been lined up to coincide with the day when Sasikala would be officially âreleasedâ from Bengaluru prison -- a calculated move on the part of the CM and his deputy. Incidentally, Sasikala is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in a Bengaluru hospital. At the party's general council meeting recently, Palaniswami invited the partymen to attend the opening ceremony at the Marina, along with families, as a sign of gratitude to the departed leader. âThe memorial adds glory to our leader. The state government has been implementing all welfare schemes initiated by her,â said AIADMK deputy coordinator K P Munusamy. "

Common people and opposition parties cadre posting their views on various local issues on social media platforms are being targeted and harassed,"" said Pawan Kalyan while addressing a press conference on the sidelines of his 2-day visit to Tirupati.

"CHENNAI: With the assembly election approaching, Dravida Kazhagam and 10 like-minded organisations have joined together under the banner of the Federation of social justice protection movement to campaign against BJP and its Hindutva ideology. The core members of the federation dubbed the AIADMK as a 'puppet' in the hands of the saffron party and added that the forthcoming election is not an electoral fight between the Dravidian majors, but it is going to be a fight between ideologies - Dradivian and Hindutva. The members of the committee wondered why the BJP was not talking about development and issues related to people's daily needs, but rather focus on communal and religious issues. The federation would start its campaign on January 30 in Coimbatore, followed by conferences in Trichy and Madurai on February 7 and 20 respectively. The campaigns aim to unmask BJPâs policies that have an egregious impact on social justice, which is the cornerstone of the development of Tamil Nadu on various fronts. âInitially, these organisations joined together to take on Rajinikanthâs spiritual politics and it's possible impact on social justice that prevails in the state. Since the actor decided against taking the political plunge, we will now focus on the Hindutva forces that are trying to spread their wings in the state,â said prof Suba Veerapandian , chief coordinator of the federation. The assembly poll is beyond electoral battle, he said, adding that the BJP has been trying to ride at the back of the AIADMK to make an inroad in the Dravidian turf and âsow the seeds of hatredâ in the name of religion and bring back the old-class and caste system in TN. âWe will unmask their hidden agenda and educate the people on safeguarding the Dravidian ideology that gave equal opportunities for all sections of the society,â he said. Periyarist Ovia, a core-member of the federation, said they would focus on the Centreâs policies that derailed the development of the state, particularly Tamil Nadu. âThe BJP are trying to uproot the century-old Dravidianism and its policies that paved the path of development of the state in different spheres. We will talk about how DMKâs policies that reflect Dravidian ideologies helped the state to march towards equality and development among all sections of the societies. Meanwhile, we will create awareness about the anti-poor policies of the Centre and how the BJP has enslaved the AIADMK party and trying to enforce its agenda,â she added. The campaign would also focus on how the ruling AIADMK government had failed to protect the interest of the state on various fronts. Several dalit activists, Periyarists and Dravidian leaders would be participating and talking extensively and touch topics on the socio-economic condition of the BJP-ruled states and how they were thrashing out the working class and poor.

"GUWAHATI: The ruling BJP and most of the opposition parties have urged the EC team headed by chief election commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora to hold the upcoming assembly election well ahead of Rongali Bihu â the biggest festival in Assam celebrated mid-April. Only Congress has demanded that polls be held after Bihu. A high-level EC team headed by the CEC is in Assam on a three-day visit which would conclude on Wednesday. The EC delegation is reviewing the poll preparedness as the five-year term of the current Assam assembly will end on May 31. âWe want the elections before Bihu or to be scheduled in such a way so that it does not hamper the Rongali Bihu celebrations. From BJP, we have informed the EC team that the elections should be held in three phases. Last time, assembly election was held in two phases and before Bihu. If Bihu festivity collides with elections, the polling percentage or voter turnout may go down,â said Assam BJP vice-president Jayanta Malla Baruah. Baruah, who was present in the meeting, hoped that polling percentage will go beyond 90% in the upcoming elections. âWe want at least 90% voter turnout so that the actual mandate comes,â he added. âSince Assam has got about 5.5 lakh new voters this time, adequate arrangements should be made for voting in view of the Covid protocols. Advanced arrangements of polling stations must be done and voters should be intimated about it,â Baruah said. BJPâs ally Asom Gana Parishad, on the other hand, has sought election in two phases. âAGP has requested the EC delegation to hold the assembly polls before Bihu in two phases. We have suggested maximum polling stations in view of the Covid situation,â said AGP leader Ramendra Narayan Kalita. He added that the EC has been urged to direct the government officials concerned to seize illegal arms. The opposition AIUDF has urged the poll panel to complete the election schedule before Rongali Bihu. âBihu is our main festival. Elections should not effect Bihu celebrations. People should get ample time to celebrate their very own festival,â AIUDF general secretary Aminul Islam said. He added that the concerns over EVM tampering should be adressed. âMany people have objections over EVM use though the EC has already decided not to go back to ballots,â Islam added. The CPM has demanded strict monitoring of the social media to stop communal hatred and curb use of money power. Advocate Hamidur Rahman, who represented Congress, said the the elections should be held after Bihu in three phases. âAfter enjoying the Bihu, the elections should be held. We have also demanded experienced, honest and sincere officers as election observers. Besides, counting of ballots should be held as early as possible and more deployment of police personnel must be ensured at polling stations,â he added. "
"NEW DELHI: The BJP has questioned senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singhâs decision to send a cheque for Rs 1,11,111 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi towards the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and has asked him not to ""politicise"" the matters of faith. Talking to timesofindia.com, senior BJP leader and former Rajya Sabha member Prabhat Jha said be it Lord Ram or any other religious figure, one should not play with the sentiments of people. Reacting to Digvijaya Singhâs offer for donation, Jha said there should not be any controversy after the Supreme Court decided the Ramjanmabhoomi matter in favour of Ram Lalla and earmarked land in the templeâs favour. Jha, who was a Rajya Sabha MP from Madhya Pradesh, said, âDigvijaya Singh comes from Raghogarh in MP. Ragho ji means Lord Ram. There is a temple of Lord Ram in his home. He worships and believes in Lord Ram in his home but does shallow politics and says objectionable things outside. The whole world knows that the donation has to made to Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) trust but he deliberately is acting like a novice.â Jha, a former BJP national vice-president, further said, âDigvijaya Singh will realise the dangers of doing politics with religion. What will happen when gods also start doing politics with him?â Digvijaya has sent a cheque to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a donation for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. The crossed account payee cheque from Digvijaya Singhâs State Bank of India account is for payment to Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Singh also wrote a letter to the PM and said, âSince I do not know in which bank and account the donations for Ram temple construction is to be deposited, I am sending my contribution of Rs 1,11,111 (Rupees One lakh, eleven thousand, one hundred and eleven only) via cheque number 601147 to Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust along with this letter. I hope you will get it deposited in the right account.â He further wrote, âLord Rama is the centre of my and my ancestorsâ faith. That is why I cannot even think of my existence without Lord Rama. In my home in Raghogarh in Madhya Pradesh, there is a Ram (Raghoji Maharaj) temple for 400 years where the deity is worshipped every day. Ram is present in every drop of my blood and yet I have never utilised him in my politics. I get solace from this and save my religion from trading. I have never utilised Lord Rama for politics and will never do it.â Digvijaya Singh quoted Mahatma Gandhi and said, âReligion is no test of nationality but a personal matter between a man his God.â Mentioning VHP, he said, âI also want to request you to urge VHP to present before the public, accounts of the funds collected in the past.â "
"Jallikattu, the traditional sport of Tamils is not the same anymore. Since 2017, after the ban on it and the subsequent peopleâs protest that shook the political circles, it has slowly turned into a political podium. The three recent events held in Madurai were used by different political parties to showcase their affiliation to the sport in a bid to connect with the people. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was one of the first national leaders in recent times to watch jallikattu at Avaniyapuram. Then there was DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin making his presence felt by showering the winners with gold coins. Though Alanganallur in Madurai has the smallest arena to conduct the games in the entire southern region, it has become the most hyped event in past couple of years with Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami making an appearance in 2020 and this year. BJP state president L Murugan too had planned to attend the Alanganallur event but cancelled it later. The face of deputy CM O Panneerselvam is referred to as the ""Jallikattu nayaganââ (hero of jallikattu) in political posters that decorate the venues, not because he conquered the game, but because he was instrumental in passing an ordinance for the games in 2017, after lakhs of people in Tamil Nadu protested against its ban. Ironically, many of the protesters from the villages who fought for the games to happen again do not have the luxury to enjoy them, as they are embroiled in legal cases because of the protests, and also because of the restrictions imposed in the form of limited passes for the audience. ""Even 10 years ago, we came whenever we wanted watched the game and returned home, but now the barricades and police have made it difficult for the common man to see the game,ââ said S Shankar of Sivaganga, 45 who has been attending jallikattus for more than 25 years. The presence of political leaders has meant the actual sport and rituals around it are overshadowed. Because of the CMâs presence at Alanganallur, 716 of the 1,366 bulls could enter the arena as the inauguration was delayed by more than an hour-and-a-half. ""It is a rule that the village temple bull has to be unleashed first into the arena and no attempt should be made to catch it, but this year because of the time constraint it could not be done. This hurt the sentiments of villagers who also protested about the violation,"" said a villager. Villagers said the token system had also become corrupt and more than 30 bulls from Valasai village were not given a chance as people with political clout and money wriggled in. With politics coming in, there is more pomp and show. The prizes include cars, bikes and gold coins, but the villagers allege that the jallikattu committees swindle money and give inferior quality prizes to the winners. Ganeshamoorthy of Kuravankulam said he had taken four gold coins that his son Vijayan won to a jeweller to value them. ""I was told that the 1g gold coin contained 90% copper,"" he said. ""They can give us cash instead of these cheap coins, as it demeans our efforts,ââ said T Raja a bull tamer. "
"Pudukottai: Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram on Monday suggested that actor Kamal Haasanâs Makkal Needhi Maiam join the DMKâCongress alliance for the upcoming assembly elections in Tamil Nadu as nothing can be achieved by remaining alone. Speaking to reporters in Pudukottai on the sidelines of a party meeting, Karti said it was impossible to succeed in politics as it happens in cinema where the protagonist becomes rich within a song. âTherefore, it will be a pragmatic decision if Kamal joins DMKâCongress alliance,â he said. âThe Congress party believes in secularism and liberal politics. Since Kamal Haasan also speaks on same lines, he should be comfortable in aligning with the coalition in which Congress is an integral part,â he said. âWhen people donât like two major coalitions in the poll fray, they tend to vote for parties like the MNM and the Naam Tamilar Katchi. While their vote share is not significant, these votes can only be considered protest votes and these are not positive votes,â he said. If the parties like MNM wanted to succeed in the mainstream politics, they should be part of a coalition, he added. To a question on issues among parties in the coalition, he said friction in multiple party coalition is obvious before election. More parties are likely to join the DMK alliance in the coming days and issues would be sorted out by deliberations, he said. "
"PUNE: Most senior leaders of all political parties emerged victorious in the gram panchayat polls in Pune district on Monday. However, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Ashok Pawar from Shirur tehsil failed to retain his village gram panchayat of Wadgaon Rasai, losing to Shiv Sena and BJP-backed panels. Similarly, former Zilla Parishad member Mangaldas Bandal-supported panel lost to NCP panels in Shikrapur. Although the NCPâs Pune district president Pradip Garatkar claimed to have won in 518 villages, the party lost Hinjewadi gram panchayat to a new panel. The Shiva Sena, Congress and BJP leaders fought together against the NCP panel. But the party won 15 seats out of 17 in in neighbouring Maan village. Senior Sena leader and former MP Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil said, âWe have managed to clinch major gram panchayat in Junnar, Ambegaon, Shirur and to some extent in Khed tehsil. We fought separately in many villages in Junnar and Ambegaon tehsils and the results are in our favour.â Ganesh Bhegade, BJP president for Pune district, claimed that the party sponsors panels have won in about 200 gram panchayats, mainly in Maval, Indapur, Shirur and Khed tehsil.

"NAGPUR: Tejashwi Yadav's performance in the recently-concluded Bihar election is nothing short of excellent. He put up a brave front against BJP and the ruling National Democratic Alliance in Bihar, just like his cricketing days. However, while he was holding one end, Tejashwi ran out of partners at the other end. With little more support from allies, he could have become the youngest chief minister of Bihar. Tejashwi played his junior cricket for Delhi and shared the dressing room with the current Indian captain Virat Kohli. Vidarbha cricketers fondly remember their encounter with the Rashtriya Janata Dal leader. After all, he bagged four wickets in their Elite Group Cooch Behar match against Vidarbha in 2007-08 season in good batting conditions at Emerald High School ground in Indore. While he could not save his team from a 10-wicket loss, Tejashwi left his mark as an off-spinner. There was a buzz around Tejashwi even before the match started. The then Under-19 skipper Viraj Kadbe, who played exceedingly well for his 198, remembers that match well. ""He was there in the junior circuit for four five years. Once you are part of a team for three four years the oppositions know about you. However, that was the first time he was playing against us. He bowled well in that match,"" Kadbe told TOI. ""It was a good batting track and there was something in it for fast bowlers but there wasn't much in it for spinners. Uska tappa achcha tha (He would bowl in the right areas consistently). He would use his height well and get good bounce. He wasn't a big turner but was accurate. I completed my hundred hitting him for a boundary,"" he added. Tejashwi bowled 29 overs and took four wickets giving away 105 runs. After bowling out Delhi for 243, Vidarbha piled up 531 in their first innings and won the match by 10 wickets. Tejashwi didn't do much with the bat. ""He was more of a bowling all-rounder. He was a quiet guy and never showed at any moment that he was a son of Lalu Prasad Yadav. I batted for almost six hours and it was Delhi's skipper Yogesh Nagar who was calling the shots. He was just another Delhi player following the instructions of his captain,"" he said. Former Vidarbha left-arm spinner Sumit Ruikar, who dismissed Tejashwi in the first innings, remembered how he would come to the ground accompanied by gun-totting security guards. ""We were told that he didn't travel with his teammates by bus due to security reasons. The guards would roam around the ground. I remember during our batting, while chatting to us, guards the guards told us 'Bahut achcha ladka hai. Sabko bahut izzat deta ha' (He is a very cultured boy who respects all). He hit me for a boundary on the first ball he faced but I had the last laugh,"" Ruikar said. Incidentally, Tejashwi's lone First Class match also came against Vidarbha in 2009-10 season. After his junior days with Delhi, Tejashwi represented Jharkhand where he played one First Class, two List A and four Twenty20 matches. He was part of Delhi Daredevils squad in 2008-09. Tejashwi also had a hundred in junior cricket and his most memorable performance came in the final of Vijay Merchant Under-17 against Mumbai. It was his unbeaten 95-ball 89 that helped Delhi take crucial innings lead against Mumbai. In the second innings, he remained unbeaten on 49 to help Delhi win the championship. Besides Kohli, Ishant Sharma also played that match. "
"NEW DELHI/NANDIGRAM: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced that she will contest the upcoming assembly election in the state from Nandigram, the home turf of former TMC heavyweight Suvendu Adhikari. The decision is being seen as an open challenge to Adhikari, the former aide of Mamata Banerjee who left her party to join the BJP. Shortly after Mamata's announcement, Adhikari expressed confidence that he will defeat Mamata by 50,000 votes and claimed that he will quit politics if he is unable to do so. Earlier today, Banerjee told her supporters in Nandigram that it has always been a lucky place for her. ""I have always started my campaign for the assembly polls from Nandigram. It is a lucky place for me. So this time I feel that I should contest the assembly polls from here. I request our state party president Subrata Bakshi to approve my name from this seat,"" Banerjee said. Bakshi, who was on the podium, swiftly accepted the request. Banerjee said she is not worried about those joining rival parties as they were hardly around when the TMC was formed. In an apparent dig at Adhikari, the TMC chief added that these leaders left the ruling party to protect the money ""they have looted"" in the last few years. Nandigram was the scene of massive public protest against ""forcible"" land acquisition by the then Left Front government for creation of a special economic zone. The protracted and often bloody protests added to Banerjee and her party's political heft and catapulted the TMC to power in 2011, marking the end of the Left Front rule of 34 years. Adhikari, an influential state leader with a mass base, is considered the face of the movement in Nandigram. The TMC supremo's decision to pick Nandigram will set up a keenly-contested clash with Adhikari. After switching over to the BJP, Adhikari has often accused Banerjee of having forgotten the people of the area who helped her gain power in the state. Banerjee is at present the MLA from Bhawanipore in south Kolkata. ""If possible, I will contest from both Bhawanipore and Nandigram. Nandigram is my elder sister and Bhawanipore is my younger sister. I will give a strong candidate from Bhawanipore also, in case I don't fight from that seat,"" she said. Banerjee said she would never allow ""a handful of people"" to sell out Bengal to the BJP. ""Those who have left the party have my best wishes. Let them become president and vice president of the country. But don't you dare to sell out Bengal to the BJP. As long as I am alive, I won't allow them to sell out my state to the BJP,"" she said. TMC sources said Banerjee's announcement will galvanise party workers in East and West Midnapore districts and adjoining areas who were feeling rudderless after Suvendu Adhikari quit the party. Without naming Adhikari, Banerjee said he will have to fight the local TMC leaders first before even dreaming of winning the state. She recalled the struggles she waged in Nandigram and Singur over forcible land acquisition by the Left Front government, and asserted the BJP was committing the same mistake by trying to undermine the farmers' protest at Delhi's borders. ""No one should undermine the farmers' struggle. The BJP is trying to undermine it and will face the same consequences like the Left did because of Nandigram and Singur,"" she said, and reaffirmed her opposition to the three farms laws. ""The CPM tried to snatch away the land of the farmers. The BJP is trying to snatch away the crops of the farmers,"" she said. Attacking the BJP for inducting a raft of leaders from rival political parties, Banerjee said it had turned itself into washing powder where tainted leaders come out clean after joining the saffron camp. ""BJP is the biggest junk party in the country. BJP is not a political party but washing powder. It's using moneybags and intimidatory tactics to lure or coerce TMC leaders into joining them,"" she alleged. Referring to the desertions from her own party, she said the BJP might have ""bought a few leaders but cannot buy the people of Bengal"". Banerjee asserted the TMC will win a third straight term in office and the BJP will be decimated. The TMC supremo alleged the BJP has bought off some media houses which are coming up with fake surveys favouring the saffron party in the assembly elections. Suvendu Adhikari switched over to the BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah last month, in a reflection of the importance the leader from Nandigram has in the saffron party's scheme of things for the West Bengal elections. He also persuaded his younger brother Soumendu, who was removed as Kanti municipality administrator, to join the BJP. His another younger brother Dibyendu and father Sisir Adhikari are TMC Lok Sabha members from Tamluk and Kanthi. Both gave Banerjee's rally a miss. The Adhikaris wield considerable influence in at least 40-45 assembly segments in East and West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia, Jhargram, parts of Birbhum â mainly in the Junglemahal region and areas in minority-dominated Murshidabad district.

"ERODE: Former president of Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) EVKS Elangovan on Thursday said actor Rajinikanth will meet the same fate as actor Sivaji Ganesan did when he tried his hand at politics. After participating in a protest against the Centreâs new farm laws, Elangovan told reporters in Erode that with each passing day, only Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs beard was growing instead of the countryâs economy. Elangovan said the Centre had betrayed farmers by bringing in the three controversial farm laws. Elangovan said the BJP will not win even a single seat in the 2021 assembly election in Tamil Nadu. âPeople of Tamil Nadu will not accept the BJP,â he said. He said the AIADMKâs alliance with BJP will affect its chances of victory in the election. "
"Pune: Political parties in the Pune Municipal Corporation will find it tough to gain mileage by putting up their leadersâ names and party signs on public works. A new policy for naming public works is being finalised. The civic administration has planned a standardisation of the naming public amenities. Name plates or their colours will not have any links to any party. The colour codes and size of the plates for the names of roads and direction signs will be fixed for synchronization. âWe are drafting the policy. The aim is to make sure wastage of public funds stops. Defacement of the city areas can be reduced with this move. A standard set for naming public projects and signages will improve the aesthetic value of public furniture,â additional commissioner of PMC Suresh Jagtap said. Various rules and regulations pertaining to the sky-sign department and municipal acts will act as the base for the policy. It will be sent to the all-party committee for approval, after which the policy paper will go to the standing committee and general body for a final stamp. It is expected to be implemented by the next fiscal. Many elected members have built arches, bus stops or bridges in their wards along with distribution of benches and garbage baskets which have been painted to align with party colours."
"CHENNAI: The state government on Tuesday accused the Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP of taking law into its own hands and trying to take out âVetrivel Yatraâ despite denial of permission. âThey are continuing with the procession despite denial of permission in complete violation of law and Covid-19 protocols,â advocate-general Vijay Narayan told the Madras high court. The yatra has nothing to do with temples. It is not a temple visit as claimed by the party. It was completely a political visit, the AG said. Opposing the submissions, advocate V Ragavachari, representing the BJP, contended that the state is taking a double stand by permitting other political parties, including the opposition party, to organise such events while denying permission for BJP. âWhat about Thevar Jayanthi? Were all Covid-19 protocols followed during the event?â, he asked. A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha, however, expressed their dismay and said: âyou (BJP) should have kept quiet during the past three days when you have approached the court for relief. But you have chosen to proceed with the rally. What are you trying to portray to this court? Not only cadres, all your leaders also participated in the rally.â Noting that the BJP is technically asking for equality in illegality, the judges said the state should act balanced manner while in permitting such events. The court also told BJP not to forget the danger of Covid-19 and said it was concerned about the safety of the public. As the advocate-general informed the court that the BJPâs fresh representation had also been rejected, the court granted liberty to BJP to challenge the rejection order and adjourned the hearing to December 2. Earlier, Vijay Narayan, submitting a status report filed by the state director-general of police, said: âOn November 6, BJP state president L Murugan commenced the yatra without permission accompanied by 250 persons in 100 vehicles. We can produce videos which show none of the participants was wearing masks. Even the state president was not wearing the mask properly.â The BJP president is carrying a Vel during the procession which is a weapon under the Arms Act and possessing the same is prohibited,â advocate-general Vijay Narayan said. He also informed the court that though gathering of up to 100 persons is permitted from November 16, processions are still prohibited as the lockdown has been extended till November 30. Accusing the state government of not acting in a balanced manner in permitting such gatherings, "
"LUCKNOW: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said on Thursday that the problem of unemployment was not a political issue, but a humanitarian one and promised to extend all possible help in the matter. Holding a video conference with around 50 youths, who hailed from different districts of Uttar Pradesh and had cleared the test for teaching posts but have not got their appointment, Priyanka Gandhi said it was her belief that the government would have to listen to the voice of the youth. ""We will have to fight from the roads to the legislature. The Congress is not going to back out on this,"" a party release quoted Priyanka Gandhi as saying. ""This is not a political issue for us, but a humanitarian matter. This is a question of justice."" The Congress general secretary assured the youth that her party would extend all possible help in this matter. The video conference, which lasted for over one-and-a-half hour, was attended by over 50 youths, state Congress media convenor Lalan Kumar said, adding that event was a part of the dialogue over unemployment. Speaking to Priyanka Gandhi, a woman candidate said she had given the exam in 2016 and was happy on her selection, but has still to get appointment. The woman said she had faced depression for two years and her family was facing immense hardships because of this. One of the youths said he was somehow earning his livelihood by giving tuition, but that has also stopped because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, while another said his marriage was called off as he did not get the job. The youths said they worked hard and performed well in the exam, but the government is ""continuously changing rules"", according to the statement. During the interaction, Priyanka Gandhi also sought their views over reports that the state government was mulling a five-year contractual service for employees of Group B and C. "
"NEW DELHI: On the first day of civic employeesâ indefinite strike, AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak claimed that it was due to BJPâs politics that the employees were not getting salaries on time. âAll 1.25 lakh employees of the three municipal corporations have gone for a strike. From the security guards to the PAs of the mayors, everyone is on strike and this is happening because of the corruption of BJP,â Pathak alleged on Monday. BJP does not have the right to stay in power in the municipal corporations if it cannot pay salaries and pensions, he added. âPeople have no money for their family, children, medicine or any other need. The massive corruption by BJP has finished the corporations and the people of Delhi are suffering along with the employees of the corporations,â Pathak alleged, accusing BJP of trying to defame Delhi government by not paying the dues for months. âThe corporations have enough money but they do not want to pay the salaries. BJP does not want to do anything constructive. What it wants is to politicise the matter and blame Aam Aadmi Party falsely,â Pathak claimed. Calling Pathakâs strike claim totally false, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed normal work by municipal staff was witnessed in all three corporations on Monday. âSince early morning, sanitation workers are working normally, teachers took online classes, hospital and health centres saw normal work and all offices worked to normal strength,â Kapoor said. All employees can be paid if Delhi government pays the corporations their dues, he added. "
"Pithoragarh: Muted celebrations took place to mark the centenary of Coolie-Begar movement in Bageshwar on Makar Sankranti due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Termed as the âbloodless revolutionâ by Mahatma Gandhi, it was on January 14, 1921, that the farmers of Kumaon rose in revolt against the Coolie-Begar system of the British government.Owing to Covid-19 this year, the centenary year saw only religious activities, whereas political activities and traditional trade fair were not allowed by the district authorities.During the event, which coincides with the Uttarayani Mela held in Bageshwar, people performed rituals on the banks of Saryu river and took a holy dip.âThe Coolie-Begar movement anniversary usually attracts an array of political parties who organise public events every year. But this year, there were restrictions due to the coronavirus,â said Chandra Sekhar Dewadi, a local resident.""Some of our workers threw copies of the three farm bills into the river and started our party's year-long programme to celebrate the centenary of the Coolie-Begar movement,"" said Lalit Pharswan, ex-Congress MLA. The Coolie-Begar system was an exploitative practice in which families of farmers were forced to provide free labour to British officers, soldiers, mountaineers and surveyors. The village headmen also used to maintain a register of coolies.In 1921, thousands of farmers marched to Bageshwar and took an oath that they will no longer work for the British as part of the dominating practice."
"BEGUSARAI/PATNA: Driving around for over a thousand kms in areas in Patna, Arwal, Nalanda, Mokama and Begusarai districts, chances are that you frequently bump into left voters. They are an enthused bunch in these elections. While a thoughtful Lal Das Ravidas of Okri village in Jehanadadâs Ghoshi constituency thinks that their party has a realistic chance this time, the party also has its appeal in first time voters like Roshan, a Rajput in Teghra Market in Begusarai, who to convince his family members also to vote for the party. Lal Mohan Chauhan in Paliganj constituency in Patna district is voting for the party as he is angry with the present government and thinks that the left candidate in his area is likely to win. The small CPI office at Teghra in Begusarai is bustling with animated discussion among party members- mostly elderly men. âThe revival of the left in Bihar is not an isolated event. It is part of the global reaction to the rise of right wing politics and growing income inequality and economic hardship for a large number of people,â concludes Sanatan Prasad Singh, Member of CPIâs district council, who is confident of a left win in Teghra. Teghra was the seat of CPIâs founding member in the state, Chandreshakhar Singh, and later leaders like Surya Narayan Singh, whose efforts turned Begusarai a stronghold of left politics in Bihar. This region was popularly known as mini-Moscow or Biharâs Leningrad and the party won 11 consecutive terms from Teghra (named Barauni- 1967 to 2005) from 1962 to 2005. Despite being a traditional stronghold, the left party was struggling to win this seat in the past two elections, partly due to delimitation and partly to alliances. âIn the last two elections, the winners were part of an alliance. This time, we are in an alliance, and hence we stand the best chance to win,â adds Singh. While voters like Pappu Singh, who belong to the Bhumihar community (a caste that has significant presence in this region), say they will vote for JD(U,) there are others like Sunil Kumar and Chand Singh, who are confident of a left win in this . Back in Patna, in the lanes of Jagat Narayan Lal Rd stands Shaheed Chandrasekhar Smriti Bhawan, CPI-MLâs main office in the state. The party is billed to emerge as the largest constituent of the left in the state. The office was vacant when this reporter reached there. âThey are all busy attending meetings,â said the caretaker, sitting next to a life size portrait of Lenin. When asked how her party will perform in these elections where caste and religion based identity have strong appeal among the voters, Kavita Krishnan, CPI(ML)âs politburo member seems confident. âCommunal or casteist ideology is the way people sometimes make sense of inequality in their world. But no person is cast in stone and every human being has a sense of justice and solidarity. Our ideology, which falls out to this good sense, does resonate with the voters,â she added. Krishnan also says that her partyâs and alliance's poll promises that address economic issues like jobs, and equal pay for equal work has support among the youth.  âBJP's attempts to dub us ""anti national"" or ""tukde-tukde gang"" fail to convince anyone. No one calls us that at ground level. In this election, the agenda set by TV doesnât have an echo at ground level,â she says. Krishnan adds that the BJP paints every issue of justice (such as arrests of equal citizenship activists in Delhi) as ""Muslim"" issues; a truly Left politics persuades people that these issues affect us all."" When asked about the national implications of the possible revival of the Left in Bihar, Krishnan points out that issues of human rights and justice that are considered untouchable by many parties are part of the CPI(ML)âs poll campaign. âFor instance, we ask our voters if they believe in promises of a party that evicts the poor from their land but is promising the same poor land in Jammu & Kashmir! We point out that even Bihar demands special state status: erosion of J&K's status and statehood weakens Bihar's rights also. Itâs a myth that a partyâs support that is built on promises about better healthcare and education will wither away if it takes a stand on larger ideological issues like Jammu & Kashmir, NRC or the crackdown on activists across the country. People have not voted for you to become soft bigots,â she adds. âThis election will probably teach everyone one basic principle of politics. Always believe in people, and build a politics that appeals to their best selves"", says Krishnan. In 1995, the left parties (CPI-26, CPM-6 and CPI-ML-6) won 38 seats in the Bihar assembly. Since then, they were going downhill. In 2010, their combined tally was 13, which further reduced to 11 in 2005 and 1 in 2010. In the last election, they had won 3 seats, all CPI(ML). "

"PATNA: With the campaigning for Bihar assembly election coming to an end on Thursday, central leaders of all political parties camping in the state for the last fortnight have started returning to their places. BJP national president JP Nadda left Patna on Thursday night. After holding rallies in Darbhanga, he spent some time with party leaders and organizational members in Patna before leaving for Delhi, said partyâs media centre and war room incharge for Bihar election, Danish Iqbal. âHe held talks with party members and discussed the good response we have received. We are forming the government,â he said. Danish said partyâs star campaigners like Manoj Tiwari, who was here for 20 days, also left Patna on Thursday. âEven Dinesh Lal Yadav (Nirahua) and Ravi Kishan, who drew big crowds, returned,â he said. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan had left on Wednesday and partyâs Bihar incharge Bhupendra Yadav will leave on Sunday. When asked if the leaders felt relaxed with the campaigning ending, he replied, âIn BJP, there is no concept of relaxing. Everyone is back to his work. For instance, all union ministers and senior leaders are now handling their responsibilities.â Four senior Congress leaders, who camped in Bihar for nearly three weeks, also left on Friday. They were Rajya Sabha member Shaktisinh Gohil, incharge of partyâs Bihar affairs, national general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala (partyâs election management committee chairman), Mohan Prakash (election management committee convener) and Pawan Kera (media coordination committee chairman) left on the last day of the campaigning. Former IPS officer and partyâs former Jharkhand president Dr Ajay Kumar, who was managing the strategy, also returned. âYes, you will not find these leaders at Sadaquat Ashram, but local leaders and workers are still there,â Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathhore said.

"KOLKATA: Stressing that there was a need to restore West Bengal's ""lost glory"", Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said the present ""appeasement politics"" in the state has hurt its age-old tradition of upholding the nation's spiritual consciousness. Maintaining that Bengal is the land of luminaries such as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, Shah said the state once used to be the centre of spiritual awakening in the entire country. ""However, the politics of 'tustikaran' (appeasement) has hurt this glorious tradition of Bengal. I hereby call upon the people of Bengal to wake up and perform their responsibilities to bring back the glory of the state."" The top BJP leader, who visited Dakshineswar temple on the second day of his two-day visit to the state, was taken to the sanctum sanctorum of the centuries-old shrine, where he offered puja to the goddess. ""I prayed for the well being of the entire state, the country and its people. We prayed that the country retains its position of glory in the world under the leadership of (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi."" Shah was greeted at the temple by members of state BJP Mohila Morcha, including its president Agnimitra Paul, who blew conch shells and put a 'tilak' on his forehead. The Union minister, after offering prayers, headed to eminent vocalist Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty's music school-cum- residence 'Shrutinandan', where he met his students and family members. "
"MUMBAI: The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra on Wednesday dismissed the opposition BJP's allegations of ""politics of revenge"" and ""muzzling of the press freedom"" in the arrest of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in a suicide abetment case. While slamming the BJP, Sena minister Anil Parab said Goswami had duped a ""Marathi"" entrepreneur forcing the latter to commit suicide two years ago. Watch: Mumbai Police reveal true picture of Arnab's arrestSena leader Sanjay Raut told reporters the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Sena, NCP and Congress has never acted vindictively against anyone since it came to power last year. He also claimed that the state government or any political party had nothing to do with the arrest. Arnab resisted arrest, made false claims of assault: PoliceGoswami was arrested in Mumbai by Raigad police on Wednesday morning for allegedly abetting suicide of a 53- year-old interior designer in 2018. ""Proper procedure of law is followed in Maharashtra. Police can take action against anyone if they have evidence. The state government hasn't acted out of revenge,"" Raut told reporters when asked about Goswami's arrest. ""There is no anarchy in Maharashtra and law of the land is followed,"" Raut said, adding that Mumbai police is a professional force. ""It is not a black day for media. Journalists also should follow ethics. Media is not an investigating agency or court. This observation is of the highest court. We are all journalists. Whoever does anything wrong will be punished by the police,"" he said. Anvay Naikâs wife welcomes police action against Arnab Goswami""The state government or any political party has nothing to do with the arrest,"" the Sena MP said. Taking a swipe at the BJP, Sena spokesperson and state parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab told reporters that Goswami's name was mentioned in the suicide note written by the interior designer. ""The Naik family had moved the court and the case is being investigated. Goswami duped the Marathi entrepreneur Anvay Naik due to which he committed suicide. Earlier, the case wasn't investigated two years agoas per the contents of the suicide note. ""The Naik family then moved court and the probe started. Where does the question of the attack on the freedom of press arise?"" he asked. ""There is no politics of revenge. The BJP is trying to save Arnab Goswami as if their party worker has been taken away by the police,"" Parab said while terming Goswami as the ""BJP's parrot"". ""A Marathi woman became a widow...and the case is being investigated. What is wrong in that? Why is the BJP trying to save him (Goswami)? How can it be called as the state of emergency in Maharashtra when a person booked for abetment of suicide is arrested?"" he asked. Parab said why was the BJP keeping mum on two other persons who were also named in Naik's suicide note and arrested. Meanwhile, Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik termed Goswami's arrest as ""Part 2 of India's Most Wanted"" and recalled the action against a TV crime show anchor who was charged with killing his wife. Suhaib Ilyasi, who had shot into limelight after hosting TV crime show India's Most Wanted was charged with murdering his wife in March 2000. He was, however, acquitted by the Delhi High Court in October 2018. ""Once upon a time there was a show called India's Most Wanted & the Anchor highlighted murders & suicides, the same anchor was held responsible for his wife's murder, Minority Affairs Minister Malik tweeted without naming Ilyasi. ""Here is Part 2 of India's Most Wanted, another anchor doing the same is now responsible for suicide #ArnabArrested, he added on the micro-blogging site. "

"Panaji: Hundreds of supporters and curious onlookers gathered outside Goa Medical College and Hospital on Monday night as news spread that Ayush minister and minister of state for defence, Shripad Naik, was being brought in for treatment after his road accident at Ankola in Karnataka. The ambulance arrived at the hospital at 11.13pm. Goa Police deployed a strong force around the hospital and threw a tight cordon, but as the crowds swelled, police personnel were seen struggling. Chief minister Pramod Sawant was among the first to reach the hospital, while power minister Nilesh Cabral, Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, BJP organisational secretary Satish Dhond, BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade and former South Goa Lok Sabha MP Narendra Sawaikar also rushed to GMC. Deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar also paid a visit to the hospital and left around midnight. Former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar also rushed to GMC around midnight as BJP karyakartas and Naikâs well-wishers kept vigil outside the hospital. Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar was also seen at the hospital. Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane were monitoring Naikâs medical treatment and Sawant even briefed the Prime Ministerâs Office about Naikâs condition. âShripad Naikâs condition is stable and he is responding well to the treatment,â Sawaikar said. Politicians and party well-wishers all appeared grim faced and repeated questioning about the circumstances behind the accident elicited guarded replies that when details are known the press will be informed. Former speaker of the Goa state legislative assembly, Rajendra Arlekar expressed deep regret at the passing away of âbhabiâ as Naikâs wife was fondly referred to as. Arlekar has been very close to the Naik family right from the early days of their foray into politics. Corporation of the city of Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar arrived at GMC to take stock of the situation and said that he would pray for Naikâs recovery. âThe unfortunate part is that Shripad Naikâs wife passed away in the accident,â said Tendulkar. As information trickled out that Naik was stable and responding to treatment, the tension among the well-wishers and party sympathisers began to ebb and the crowd started to thin. "
"Chennai: Actor Rajinikanth has asked his fans not to push him any further to rethink his decision on not entering electoral politics by holding rallies. âI have made my decision. Do not cause more and more anguish by organizing such rallies and trying to pressure me to enter politics. I have clearly explained in my statement why I am not entering electoral politics,â Rajinikanth said in a statement on Monday. Rajinikanthâs statement came a day after a section of his fans held a rally at Valluvar Kottam here to urge him to take a relook at his earlier decision not to enter electoral politics. In a statement on December 29, 2020, Rajinikanth had said that he was unable to enter electoral politics or launch a party owing to his health condition. Though initially shocked by his decision, a majority of his fans and Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) members grudgingly accepted the actorâs decision, since it was made based on his health condition. Rajinikanth also expressed his anguish that some fans along with certain expelled RMM members came together to hold a rally on Sunday. It went against the decision of RMM, said the actor, thanking its members, who did not take part in the rally. While expressing his displeasure over attempts to hold such rallies to push him more, Rajinikanth said he was happy with the way the rally on Sunday was organized, without causing hindrance to the public.

"CHENNAI: Days after announcing that he is quitting politics and will not enter it until his death, Tamilaruvi Manian on Monday agreed to stay on as the founder president of the Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam. Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam, a registered political party, has decided to launch a membership enrolment drive to increase the membership to 10 lakh from the present three lakh over the next six months, a statement from the party said.

Prior to that, as president of the Gandhiya Makkal Iyakkam, he was closely interacting with Rajinikanth and convinced him to enter politics to cleanse the system and bring about a change. "
"JALANDHAR: Hinting at attempting new socio-political engineering, BJPâs Punjab unit organising secretary Dinesh Kumar has said mainly Jat Sikhs had been dominating politically in the state till now and what happened in Haryana politics could be replicated here. He said that 82% (non-Jats) had not got proper share in power. When asked how the BJP intended to expand in Punjab when there was such strong opposition to it due to the farm laws, he replied, âWhen it became Jat versus all others in Haryana, BJP formed the government. If this can happen in Haryana (where Jats dominated politically and most CMs were also Jats), Punjab is not any different. Here also, 82% not-Jat Sikhs have never got an opportunity to have proper share in power.â He claimed that many in Congress were ready to switch to BJP and were just waiting for the current agitation to end. âWe are being told that as we donât have a prominent Sikh face then how can we move ahead in Punjab. But we donât need a Sikh face. Akali Dal, Congress and AAP will give one (a Jat Sikh face). BJP is a party with people from sarv samaaj (all sections) and anybody can be made a leader. For us all options are open. We have Jat Sikhs and other Sikhs too and they are our prominent office-bearers,â Kumar told TOI on Wednesday. âTill now, only Jat Sikhs have been ruling in the state, as only they have become chief ministers. They did not give respectable (power) share to others. We have Sikhs and Jat Sikhs too in the party, and our approach is inclusive,â he said. About the partyâs plans ahead, he said the party had given a very respectable place to Dalits and they would join in big numbers soon. To a query regarding the partyâs expansion plan as it was active in just 20% of the total assembly seats in Punjab, he replied, âSociety thinks in several ways... when there is oppression, polarisation also happens... we are taking all people along, including Jat Sikhs.â Kumar also claimed that a big section in Punjab Congress which was opposed to Captain Amarinder Singh were ready to join BJP. Asked if it was still the case despite farmers agitation, he asserted, âThey are still ready to join us and just want the agitation to get over.â He also asserted that the current agitation was not of the farmers but of the Congress.

"CHENNAI: Enthusiastic fans of Rajinikanth held a well-attended rally at Valluvar Kottam in Chennai to urge the actor to reconsider his decision and take the plunge into politics. The rally, which was organized without the official consent of Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) and against its advice, attracted a few thousand fans who converged from various parts of the state. The slogan ""Va Thalaiva Arasiyalukku; Va Va Thalaiva"" (Enter politics, our leader) rent the air at the rally that lasted a few hours. On December 29, in a statement, Rajinikanth had stated he would not be launching a political party to enter electoral politics, citing his health condition. Chennai City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, while granting permission for the rally on a request from N Ramdas, joint secretary of RMM south Chennai unit and one of the six members of the outfit's state-level disciplinary committee, had restricted the number of people to 200 and the duration of the rally to one hour. But enthusiastic fans landed at the venue much earlier and raised slogans asking their superstar to enter politics. Mobile toilets, a help desk and sanitizers had been organized at the venue. ""We were all shocked when Thalaivar made that statement. But we accepted it due to the truth behind his state of health. But facing the questions from people became difficult, since just three days prior to that we had speeded up the efforts to form booth committees. Hence, we decided to try once again to convince him to rethink his decision,"" Ramdas told TOI. ""While people like me are associated with our Thalaivar for 42 years, some of the RMM district secretaries who came in three years ago asked us not to go ahead with the rally,"" said Ramdas, a founding member of Rajini fans club. ""We are told Thalaivar watched our rally through facebook link and was happy. We still hope he may reverse his decision. He need not come out and issue statements and we can run the campaign on social media and videos from him,"" he added. There was much drama enacted behind the scenes ahead of the rally over the last few days. At least two RMM district secretaries, north Chennai's Santhanam and south Chennai's Ravichandran had issued official statements asking RMM members and office bearers not to participate in the rally, especially since all district secretaries had agreed to abide by Rajinikanth's decision due to his health condition. While all 38 district secretaries circulated such a statement internally, V M Sudhakar, RMM convenor expressed unhappiness that some members were indulging in fund raising to conduct the rally. AVK Raja, RMM central Chennai district secretary, under whose control the rally's venue falls, lodged a formal complaint, requesting the police not to grant permission for the rally. It was withdrawn two days ahead of the rally. ""Having accepted Thalaivar's decision, we felt the rally was unnecessary. But we later gave our consent after the organizers assured us the public would not be inconvenienced. It turned out to be a great rally,"" said Raja. "
"KOCHI: With election commission likely to declare elections to local bodies in a few days, political parties have begun discussions on seat sharing and preparing candidatesâ list for contesting from different divisions of Kochi corporation. While both UDF and LDF hope to assume power in the corporation, BJP expects that its candidates can win more seats in the upcoming elections. âOn Monday, LDF leaders held discussions regarding seat sharing. Once the seat sharing among the constituents is over, parties like CPM will start fixing candidates,â a CPM leader said. LDF will have to also consider the entry of Kerala Congress (M) as a new constituent in to the front. Candidates of Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) also will have to be accommodated. Leaders like former mayor and LJD leader K J Sohan may also contest for the party. Congress also has started discussions for fixing candidates within the party. âThe district Congress committee may come up with preliminary list by weekend. Candidates who could be fixed unanimously will be announced first,â sources with Congress said. Anticipating victory for LDF, many heavyweights in CPM have already started coming up with aspirations to contest the elections. The names of former mayor C M Dinesh Mani, former deputy mayor C K Manisankar, former opposition leader of Kochi corporation and the party district secretariat member K J Jacob and district committee member M Anil Kumar are doing the rounds. But, the party leadership is yet to start formal discussions in this regard. While CPM leaders are competing to contest in the corporation election, many of the senior Congress leaders prefer to contest polls to the assembly. Though the names of many leaders who gird their loins for contesting the corporation elections were out initially, most of them are learned to have backed out. They are expecting that UDF would come to power in the state after the assembly polls which are to be held in April-May next year. They are eyeing for a cabinet berth in the state government to be formed after the assembly election and so, they have chose to stay out of corporation elections. Former chairman of GCDA N Venugopal, deputy mayor K R Premakumar and former welfare standing committee chairman A B Sabu are the leaders who are now in the run up to the mayorâs post if UDF comes to power. BJP which is having two seats â Cherlai in West Kochi and Ernakulam Central â is expecting to win more seats this time. Besides Cherlai, BJP hopes to win Panayappilly and Amaravati seats in West Kochi. "
"NEW DELHI: Describing Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan as ""marginal political players"", senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has said they remain very popular film stars but are unable to attract public opinion to their point of view in political terms. Aiyar, who has been named in three key panels set up by the Congress for Tamil Nadu polls, asserted that superstar Rajinikanth's decision that he will not enter electoral politics will not make a tinker's difference as the state readies for the assembly polls. ""When he (Rajinikanth) said he was going to come into politics, I said it is not going to make a tinker's difference, now that he has decided not to come into politics, I repeat what I said, it is not going to make a tinker's difference,"" Aiyar told PTI in an interview. ""Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth are not anything but marginal political players,"" the former Union minister said. It was different in the old days when people like M G Ramachandran (MGR), Sivaji Ganesan and even Jayalalithaa were involved in films that carried a revolutionary social message, he said. Noting that former Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers M Karunanidhi and C N Annadurai were also deeply involved in cinema, he said the powerful scripts written by Annadurai and extremely powerful dialogues by Karunanidhi that were delivered magnificently by MGR resulted in films in Tamil cinema having in the 1950s the same role as social media is today having in determining the politics of northern India. ""Since these two (Rajinikanth and Haasan) have never used cinema as a medium for a political message, they remain what they are - very very popular film stars, but not people who attract public opinion to their point of view in political terms,"" Aiyar said. He argued that there have been no two actors more popular on the Hindi silver screen than Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna, but ""what flops they were in politics"". The same thing applies in the South, he added. Making a U-turn, superstar Rajinikanth last month announced he will not enter politics in view of his frail health, putting an end to his long-nurtured plans and describing his recent hospitalisation as God's warning. ""Only I know the pain behind making this announcement,"" the 70 year-old actor had said, just days before he was to spell out the contours of his party based on spiritual politics aimed at bringing a total change in the Dravidian heartland Tamil Nadu in the 2021 assembly elections. Haasan had launched Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) in February 2018 and the party had faced the 2019 Lok Sabha elections but could not win a single seat. Haasan, through his ongoing poll campaign, has latched on to the welfare legacy of MGR and has been attacking both the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) over alleged corruption.

"NEW DELHI: After meeting Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said he discussed cabinet expansion with the BJP leadership and briefed them about the results of the gram panchayat election held in the state last month. ""I explained to them in detail the gram panchayat result. We also discussed the cabinet expansion in detail. The names will be cleared as early as possible. 100 per cent this is the last meeting. They are going to clear the names as early as possible,"" said the Karnataka CM. This comes after BS Yediyurappa met Union home minister at the latter's residence in Delhi on Sunday to discuss the political situation in Karnataka. BJP chief JP Nadda and party's in-charge for Karnataka Arun Singh were also present at the meeting. Yediyurappa had arrived in the national capital earlier on Sunday. He told reporters, ""I am going to discuss the political situation in Karnataka. Recently we won gram panchayat elections and local elections in a big way."" The chief minister said he would discuss the candidates for upcoming by-elections in the state. ""Within a month, we are going to face by-elections for vacant seats of Lok Sabha and state assembly. We need to finalise candidates. I will try to meet Nadda Ji as well to discuss all this,"" he said. Responding to preparations for the vaccination process for Covid-19, Yediyurappa appeared confident that the coronavirus situation is under control in the state. "
"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Thiruvavananthapuram Vikasana Munnettam (TVM), the party announced by Awake Trivandrum, a confederation of pro-development organizations and professional organizations, officially came into existence on Sunday. TVM spokespersons, former CEO of Technopark, G Vijayaraghavan and Trivandrum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) president S N Raghuchandran Nair, made the announcement in this regard on Sunday. âClamour of Changeâ is the slogan raised by TVM. Vijayaraghavan and Raghuchandran Nair said in a statement issued here on Sunday that TVM will be fielding its candidates in all 100 wards of the city corporation in the upcoming local-body election. They will be releasing their election agenda in a few days. They intend to release a list of development projects needed for the city and make those projects a topic of discussion among the voters in the days leading to the election. They said that TVMâs formation and the decision to contest in election can be seen as a mark of protest against the major political fronts who have ignored the development of the capital city for years. TVM intends to field youths with good educational qualification and well aware of local issues. Though there has been criticism that ruling parties, irrespective of their political lenience, have always turned a blind eye to the development of the capital city, it was the current governmentâs stance against handing over Trivandrum International Airport to Adani Group that became the trigger for the formation of TVM. The governmentâs stance made way for a strong social media movement in support of development, which saw various organizations coming together against the government. Major industry associations of the city, including Trivandrum Agenda Task Force, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association (CREDAI) and Indian Medical Association (IMA) and peopleâs initiatives like Janapaksham and NRI Returneesâ Association as well as various residentsâ associations and clubs such as Lionâs Club and Rotary Club too have lent their support to the cause of TVM.

"Kolkata: âAs with judges, so with governors, old affiliations of a political kind lapse before the new constitutional responsibility. Most governors, one may note, from 1947 onwards, have risen to their role,â former West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi told TOI on Saturday in an email interview. To emphasise his point, Gandhi cited two examples. âGovernor T N Chaturvedi in Karnataka was an NDA-appointee. Yet no one saw in him any trace of political bias. His term of office was quintessentially constitutional. The late Ram Kapse was an ardent member of the Sangh Parivar but as lieutenant governor of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands during the time the 2006 tsunami hit, he was just one thing and nothing else â a turbine of energy â focussed, calm, strong. There was no politics in what he did. There was only duty, constitutional, conscientious duty,â the former governor said. Elaborating what he perceives to be a governorâs role, Gandhi said: âGovernor is many things in one â a guardian of the Constitution and the laws in the state, a person the chief minister as well as those in the opposition can turn to for consultation and thought-sharing without hesitation, and one who the people of the state look up to, unconditionally, as someone who cares for them. The governor is also one whom the civil services and other constitutional authorities in the state look upon as a mentor.â He added: âIn operational terms, she or he is also meant to be, in President R Venkataramanâs famous description of the role of the President, an emergency light, meant to come on when the âmainâ power line has gone off, and to provide light till such time as that âmainâ power line is restored.â Saying his Bengal tenure was ânot very different from those of most of my predecessors in officeâ, Gandhi said: âBut I want to remember my years amongst the extraordinary people of West Bengal not by the âturbulenceâ I may have witnessed but by the high sense of responsibility and maturity that the then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and then opposition leader Mamata Banerjee showed when they agreed on a certain approach to solving the Singur impasse. That was responsible democracy at work â a tribute to the mature ethos of the state.â Responding to whether he felt gubernatorial positions had become irrelevant, Gandhi replied in the contrary. âOn the contrary, I believe governors today are of greater relevance than ever before because the edge of political competition has become very sharp in our states and the net of alternatives has become extremely tight. This requires the Constitutionâs provisions to be followed in the state with great vigilance, objectivity, and sensitivity to the ethos of the state. The person who heads the state, namely the governor, is uniquely â and constitutionally â positioned and mandated to ensure that,â he said. Sharing his thoughts on âfreedom of expressionâ before India celebrates it 75th year of Independence and the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Gandhi said: âOur independence struggle was fought on the basis that India belongs to its people who belong to no one religion but to many, to no one language but to many, to no one ideology but to the freedoms of belief and expression. We rejected the divisive theory underlying the demand for Pakistan. (Mahatma) Gandhi lived and died for such a united India. Netajiâs Azad Hind Fauj as indeed his political career in its totality clung to the idea of Hindu-Muslim unity. His slogans, his songs, and his statements, each one of them, held the truth that India cannot be free except with respect for its diversities. As we approach the 75th anniversary of our Independence, we must re-affirm that ideal.â On nationalism, Gandhi said: âNo one loved India more than Rabindranath Tagore. But not as what it was but as what it was meant by its higher nature to be. Pride in oneâs desh is like faith in oneâs mother. It is not just about the physicality of oneâs country. It is about the pulsations of oneâs roots. The desh to which I belong and relate to is the India that Dara Shukoh wanted to see beyond the Mughal Empire, that Matangini Hazra, Bhagat Singh and Gandhi gave their lives for. âIt is the India which Tagore portrayed in the words ghora timira ghana nibira nishithe, pirita, murchhita deshe, dusvapne, atankeâ¦ (frightening, dense, dark night, immobilized and terror-struck as in a nightmare) and from which condition he appealed to Mother India to redeem it. And it is the India in which, as he writes in the songâs concluding lines, â¦ratri prabhatila udila robi-chhobi purba udayagiri bhaleâ¦ (as this night ends, there arises on Indiaâs eastern mountain-face, the glow of a new dawnâ¦)â "
"CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, his deputy O Panneerselvam, opposition leader M K Stalin and leaders of various political parties on Saturday condemned the demolition of the memorial established on the premises of the University of Jaffna in memory of the Tamils who died in the civil war in the island nation. The monument, which was established in 2019 at the university, was razed down during the late hours of Friday. The shocking incident took place just two days after external affair minister S Jaishankarâs visit to the neighbouring country. He was in Sri Lanka for three days and left for India on Thursday. Taking to Twitter, the chief minister expressed shock over the demolition that had taken place overnight. âI strongly condemn this brutal act of the government of Sri Lanka, that has caused great pain to the Tamils across the world, and the vice-chancellor for being complicit to the action,â the CM said. Panneerselvam said that demolition had come at a time when fighting was on seeking justice for people, who were killed in hordes in the civil war. The disgraceful act of racists was condemnable as it further hurt the sentiments of Tamils, he said. Coming down heavily on the Sri Lankan government for bringing down the memory, Stalin urged the Union government to condemn it. Tagging the PMO office, Stalin tweeted, âAs a continuation of the destruction of the memorials of Eelam Tamils, the Mullivaikkal memorial in Jaffna university was demolished. I strongly condemn this. The PMOIndia should register condemnation.â He further said, âThis is the expectation of the Tamils across the globe.â MDMK leader Vaiko, PMK leader Ramadoss and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, Tamizhaga Vazhurimai Katchi leader T Velmurugan, AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran and MNM leader Kamal Haasan have also expressed their strong protest against the incident. Vaiko and Velumurugan have announced a protest in front of the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai on Monday. Ramadoss, in a series of tweets, sought the intervention of the Modi government in this issue and also urged it to ensure the livelihood of the Lankan Tamils. He wondered how the Eelam Tamils would live with equality, peace, and dignity when the Lankan government not even allowing the existence of the memorial built for the Tamils, who were killed in genocide. He tagged external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who visited the island nation recently. "
"AMRITSAR: While denying any pressure from SAD(B), Bibi Jagir Kaur, the newly elected president of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) openly dubs SAD(B) as SGPCâs sword arm which being a political panthic party provides political strength to SGPC. After taking over the reins of SGPC, Kaur has focused her attention on creating awareness among Sikhs, especially the youths, about their religious history, Sikh Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of religious living) besides propagation of Sikh guruâs teachings and fighting against illiteracy.

SGPC came into existence after a long struggle and making supreme sacrifices, I have observed that these days many Sikhâs, especially the youth, are not much aware of the struggle made by the community elders, their religious history, or why the sacrifices were made, besides, there is a dire need to make them aware of the Sikh Rehat Maryada which summaries the teachings of Sikh guruâs and outline the Sikh way of living. I was surprised to find that 80 per cent of the congregation didnât even know about the history of Fategharh Sahib is when I asked them during a religious function. I am focusing on making the present day Sikh youth aware of the Sikh history and Sikh Rehat Maryada. During the farmers' struggle on the borders of Delhi, I have sent as many as 200 volunteers of SGPC carrying Sikh religious books to propagate about Sikh Rehat Maryada, Sikh history and Sikh guruâs teaching in a group of five to ten persons. Q. Has the SGPC failed in delivering its duties to the extent that a need is being felt to even tell the Sikh community a way of life?A. I wouldnât call it a failure but of course, there are forces that are hell bent upon misleading the people by telling lies and creating confusion among them, and for a temporary period of time they have been successful. It is just that under their influence, a few Sikhs have forgotten about the Sikh Rehat Maryada though they have full faith in Sikh gurus and are regular at Gurudwaraâs, wear Sikh symbols. Like several deraâs have their own maryada and when Sikhs start going to those deraâs they get confused. But now SGPC has taken up the task to make the youth aware of the Sikh Rehat Maryada and its significance in the life of a Sikh. Q. There is rampant abuse of drugs these days in Punjab; can SGPC be of any help to check the malpractice among youth?A. We have to first understand the genesis of drug abuse; I hold illiteracy and unemployment responsible for drug addiction to a larger extent. We are trying to impart education to even at those remote places where government fails to reach, we will be further flourishing our educational institutes which will not only expand their reach but also create job opportunities. Similarly, job opportunities would be created in SGPC run medical institutions. Besides, during the 400th birth anniversary of Sikhâs ninth Guru Teg Bahadur I have decided to involve all the schools and colleges to impart the teachings and values of Sikhism so the Sikh youth could find their path and automatically abstain from drugs. We will also discuss with economists on creating more employment opportunities for the youth. Q. It is generally believed that SGPC is run by SAD(B) by proxy and the party also choose and pick SGPCâs president, how correct is this?A. This is an entirely a wrong perception. No doubt, being a political panthic party, SAD(B) is our strength. SGPC came into existence during Gurdwara Reform Movement, the SAD was itself formed at Akal Takht to provide strength to SGPC. And this is the party on whose tickets, Sikhs contest SGPC elections and become its members, itâs our political panthic power. When Congress was in power they did army action on Golden Temple, itâs only SAD that talks about Sikhs, if we will have political panthic power only then SGPC will be strong. During my last tenure as president of SGPC, not even a single time, the SAD(B) president ever interfered in the SGPCâs functioning and even now during almost one month time of my presidentship, the SAD(B) president never gave any guidelines or instructions. Q. Then why many people, especially the opposition party blames SAD(B) for running the SGPCâs affairs?A. This ambiguous and deceitful propaganda is made by the people who have been rejected by the masses. For example, if majority of 170 members of SGPC have won on the ticket of SAD(B), it means people have accepted SAD(B)âs policies and have faith in the party. So there is no reason of making hue and cry except showing their own frustration. Q. How will you justify a politician being the president of a religious body, you have also been a Punjab cabinet minister?A. I am not just a politician, first of all, I am a devout Sikh, itâs not evil or crime being a minister, even when I was a minister we were strengthening the education system, road network, provide employment, make development etc. of Punjab. If I am a minister then I have more constitutional power to help the common masses. Similarly, the SGPC president works as per the religious aspirations of the sangat, people expect a lot from us and hope that SGPC will stand by them in their thick and thin. I donât find any harm in a politician running the religious institution. However, it should be ensured that political power should remain under the spiritual authority. "
"CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, opposition leader M K Stalin and several other political partiesâ leaders have extended Tamil Nadu Day greetings. Last year, the TN government declared that November 1 would be celebrated as Tamil Nadu Day. The AIADMK government, last year, declared that November 1 would be celebrated as state formation day. The state was created in 1956 following an exercise of the linguistic reorganization of the state, it was rechristened as Tamil Nadu by then chief minister C N Annadurai on January 14, 1969. Hitherto, it was known as Madras. âTamil language is our identity. We should develop the language and the state that speaks the language. We should be determined to work hard to take the state forward,â said the CM in a statement and listed out various schemes and programmes by the ruling party to protect and enrich the language. DMK leader M K Stalin, in his message wishing Tamil Nadu Day celebration, said it was the duty of the people to protect the richness of Tamil language, Tamil pride, and the stateâs rights. âOn this day, we should take a vow to stand together to fight against religious fanatic forces and protect the nationâs pluralism and diversity. We should restore the rights of the state at any cost,â he said in the statement. PMK leader S Ramadoss, in a statement, expressed his greetings and said the duty of government does not end with celebrating Tamil Nadu Day, but it should ensure the rights of the state and its people. âWe have lost several of our rights in the past. We should take a vow to retrieve our rights,â he said "
"BENGALURU: Superstar Rajinikanth briefly visited Bengaluru on Sunday night to meet his elder brother. Though the actor had plans to stay for a day, swelling crowds in front of his brotherâs house prompted him to cut short his trip and leave for Chennai early Monday. According to sources, the 69-year-old star reached the city by road at 9pm on Sunday and went straight to his elder brother Sathyanarayana Raoâs residence off Mysuru Road near Nayandahalli. A media contingent spotted Rajinikanth in the back seat of a black SUV as he pulled into Raoâs residence. Rajinikanth waved at people gathered in front of his brotherâs house as he walked in. It is said the superstar made the journey from Chennai to meet his brother to seek his blessings before starting his political career. However, there was no independent confirmation of this. It is also said that Rajinikanth had come to seek Raoâs blessings ahead of his 70th birthday (December 12). Earlier in Chennai, the actor had announced his decision to reveal the name of his political party on December 31 and commence party work from January 1. As the news of Rajinikanth arriving in Bengaluru spread, his fans started gathering outside his brotherâs residence. Around 11pm, the actor made a brief appearance on the balcony of the building, much to the delight of the group waiting patiently despite the drizzle.  He left the city by road in the early hours of Monday and returned to Chennai. He is expected to join the sets of his upcoming Tamil film Annaatthe, said sources. "
"CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday prohibited banners or other advertising materials promoting any political party inside premises of ration shops in the state while distributing 2,500 Pongal cash gift. As to such banners outside the ration shops, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said, ""Gates, arches, cutouts and the like, indeed, are a cause of concern and have resulted in accidents."" The court said the order will apply to all political parties and their material and should be implemented uniformly. The court passed the orders on the plea moved by DMK alleging that the ruling AIADMK is putting up such banners inside and outside the ration shops promoting their leaders in total violation of the undertaking made to the court. Senior advocate P Wilson of DMK submitted that no political party should attempt to take mileage out of a government programme by printing its leaflets or other material or circulating the same while making available the Pongal gift hampers from within the ration shops or the precincts of the shops. Accepting to adhere to the conditions, advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted that the gift hampers are packed in a bag bearing the picture of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and the present chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami. The court said, ""At this stage, it may not be feasible to replace the bags. In such circumstances, other than what appears on the bags, no other material indicating any political party or the like should be made over to the recipients along with the gift hamper, nor any leaflet or other political advertisement displayed within the ration shops or the precincts thereof.""

"Kozhikode: Putting an end to all speculations, IUML state president Panakkad Syed Hyder Ali Shihab Thangal has announced that partyâs national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty would return to state politics. Talking to reporters after the parliamentary board meeting at Panakkad in Malappuram on Sunday, he said national organizing secretary E T Muhammad Basheer would coordinate the national-level activities of the party. Thangal said Kunhalikutty would oversee all the ensuing elections. âWe could see the positive results of entrusting Kunhalikutty in the last Lok Sabha elections,â he said. Many eyebrows were raised when Kunhalikutty decided to shift his area of activity to Delhi at a time when the IUML leader was immersed in the state politics. His detractors insinuated that he hoped a UPA win and envisaged a larger role for himself in the new dispensation. Even after his election to the Lok Sabha, Kunhalikutty remained active in Kerala politics in an informal way. He was the arbitrator in the tug-of-war between the coalition partners of the UDF. Kunhalikutty was entrusted to mediate between the warring factions of the Kerala Congress (M). Unlike Basheer, Kunhalikutty had not shown much interests in the national politics. There was a group within the party that was opposed to his return to his home turf. Basheer said the party believed that the effective leadership of Kunhalikutty was imperative at a critical juncture. His presence was needed for the effective management of the election campaign, he said. Kunhalikutty told reporters that the party sees the coming chain of elections with utmost seriousness. âThe people of the state are looking for an alternative as the present government is doing nothing. IUML is duty-bound to strengthen the UDF and the party will evolve various strategies to this end,â he said. He said the responsibility entrusted by the party is challenging. âThere is the issue of Covid-19 and the dismal state of the economy. The governmentâs reaction to the situation is unimpressive,â he said. Asked whether the split in the Kerala Congress (M) would affect UDFâs prospects, he said people are with the UDF. âWe could win LDFâs sure seats in the last Lok Sabha elections because of the peopleâs trust,â he said.

"HOWRAH: Laxmi Ratan Shukla on Thursday chose not to make any long-term commitments about his future, saying he was âleaving politics for nowâ and would not say whether this was âshort term or long termâ. In his first formal reaction 72 hours after his resignation from the Bengal cabinet was accepted by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Shukla stressed he âwill continue to work for peopleâ. He was speaking at his Howrah cricket academy. Choosing not to comment on political reactions after his resignation, Shukla did mention his âgratitudeâ to the CM for saying âLaxmi bhalo cheleâ and for giving him a platform to work for people for the last four-and-a-half-years. He refused to answer who he would like to see as the next chief minister of Bengal. âI am a sportsperson. I am also a proud Bengali. I try to serve people with whatever I can. This is something I will keep doing,â he said and added: âI intend to complete my full term as an MLAâ. Shukla also insisted that no political meaning should be read into his Thursday morning Facebook post along with a portrait with Sourav Ganguly. The post read: âA true leader/captain not only plays, but also makes his team play.â âI played with Dada for clubs, in the Bengal Ranji team, for India and IPL. He is a leader and friend. This was for him,â Shukla said. âI am a sportsman,â he added. âAnd people are witnesses. I always performed best when my team needed it.â Referring to the resignation episode, he said: âI did not speak to media. A few things are best not said in public. I will never speak on internal party affairs to media. I went to meet Bakshi sir (Subrata Bakshi, Trinamool national secretary and MP) on January 2. There, when I heard about Dada, I rushed to the hospital.â Asked whether he was keen to play the larger role of a cricket administrator, Shukla said âyesâ. âCAB (Cricket Association of Bengal) has been doing good work. Bengal is also performing well. I have always tried to do my bit for cricket in Bengal. I would like to keep doing so in future too,â he said. Asked about Trinamool minister Arup Rayâs âa general never leaves a battlefieldâ comment and statements by MLA Vaishali Dalmiya and former Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty, Shukla said: âWith due respect to all my seniors, I have nothing to say on these. I have my highest regards for all of them.â âI have always believed Bengal knows to rise above adversities,â he continued. âWe have seen how amid Covid and Amphan, people ste-pped out on streets to lend a hand to others. I believe nothing â no differences â should come in the way of helpi-ng others. This is what I will keep doing as long as I can.â "
"KOLKATA: Continuing his tirade against the ruling TMC, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh on Sunday said the social welfare projects launched by the state government does not provide any ""real benefit"" to the public. Addressing a rally in East Midnapore, Ghosh said chief minister Mamata Banerjee has announced schemes with big names but they haven't catered to the needs of people. ""There are so many shrees, so many sathis...we are losing count of them. But how many people are getting real benefits? Under the Sabujsathi scheme, defective bicycles were distributed, while the Swasthya Sathi is a non-starter. Same with all other projects,"" the Midnapore MP claimed. Ghosh further said that the state, after failing to utilise central grants of over Rs 2,000 crore for Cyclone Amphan relief, is now writing to the Union government for allocation of Rs 8,500 crore, but ""no one trusts Didi (Mamata Banerjee) anymore."" ""None trusts Didi will use the amount judiciously. Everyone has seen how Amphan relief money went into the account of local leaders from her party, from panchayat pradhan to other chieftains. And once the matter came to public knowledge, Didi said it was an exception, a mistake. Is it really a mistake! We know that after May 2021 such mistakes won't recur anymore."" Ghosh said. Pointing out that leaders and activists of the ruling TMC are now revolting against the leadership, Ghosh said ""every other day someone is deserting party, which is slowly turning into a crumbling edifice."" ""The ruling party is withdrawing security of leaders who have left the TMC and slapping false cases on opponents. This will stop after six months,"" he said. Ghosh predicted that the BJP will win 200 seats in the upcoming assembly elections, and TMC wont be able to bag more than 50. ""The BJP flag is flying high everywhere, even in areas where it was not seen sometimes ago, he added. Elections to the 294-member Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year. "
"Margao: A political slugfest has begun in Margao over the issue of jeweller Swapnil Walkeâs murder case. On one side, the councillors of Margao municipality owing allegiance to Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, on Thursday, demanded action against those âmaligning the nameâ of Kamat on social media over the issue, while on the other side, BJP Margao Mandal, on Friday, launched a scathing attack on Kamat for providing âsafe havens to anti-social elementsâ for âbuilding his vote bankâ in Margao. If the Kamat-affiliated councillors accused the BJP brass of trying to suppress investigations into the case, BJP Margao Mandal president Rupesh Mahatme, addressing mediapersons, dared the councillors to prove their allegations or resign from the party. âIf BJP wanted to suppress investigation, the police wouldnât have cracked the case within 24 hours,â he said. BJP spokesperson Sharmad Raiturkar urged the police to cleanse Margao of all anti-social and criminal elements by keeping a tab on their movements and checking their antecedents. âDonât wait to act after the crime is committed,â he told the police. âBefore the Manohar Parrikar-led BJP government came to power in 2012, there was reign of terror in Margao with people afraid to confront any mischief monger from Moti Dongor. There would be gang wars and deadly assaults by choppers. People havenât forgotten the recovery of swords from Moti Dongor area. The crime hubs were reined in,â Raiturkar, who lost to Kamat twice in the assembly elections, said. Naming Jakir band, Fakir band and other pockets as crime hubs in Margao, Raiturkar urged people to cooperate with the police and alert them about any anti-social activities taking place of criminal elements taking shelter in their localities.

"BARODA (SONIPAT): To counter BJP candidate and Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, Congress has roped in Olympian Krishna Punia in the Barodaâs electoral âdangalâ. A recipient of Arjuna Award and Padma Shri, Punia has been campaigning for Indu Raj Narwal to counter the BJPâs claims that the entire sports fraternity is supporting Yogeshwar. Addressing public meetings in villages of Baroda assembly constituency on Wednesday, Punia said it was the erstwhile Congress government, led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda, which recognised the sportspersons and transformed the tiny state of Haryana into a sports nursery. No sportsperson can deny the fact that the name and fame of any sportsperson from Haryana in the country is only due to the efforts of Hooda, she said. Punia, who was elected MLA from Sadulpur in Rajasthanâs Churu district in 2018, claimed that she was also from a very humble background, just like Narwal, who is the Congress nominee from Baroda. It was Hooda governmentâs support to sportspersons that âmade me a sports celebrity and now an MLA in Rajasthanâ, she said. Originally from Agroha village in Hisar district, Punia is married in Churu district and is now a Congress leader. She had contested the Lok Sabha elections held in May last year as Congress nominee from Jaipur (rural) seat but lost to BJPâs Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who is also an Olympic medallist. Former chief minister Hooda and his son Deepender Hooda had campaigned for her in Rajasthan during both of her elections (assembly and general). Punia, who stands six feet tall, had hit the headlines in 2010 when she became the first Indian track and field star in 52 years to win a gold medal in the Commonwealth Games. She had also participated in the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics and had won a bronze at the 2006 Asian Games held in Doha. Besides Punia, Congress is planning to involve renowned pro-kabaddi players like Pardeep Narwal, Sonu Hooda, Mohit Chillar and others to support its Baroda bypoll nominee. âWe have grown up with himâSources in the Congress claimed that the party is also planning to bring Olympic medallist and renowned boxer Vijender Singh to campaign for Narwal. Vijender, a member of Congress, had unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary elections from Delhi in May 2019. A large number of sportspersons have been campaigning for BJPâs Yogeshwar Dutt, including Babita Phogat, who joined the saffron party recently. TOI spoke to several sportspersons who were accompanying Yogeshwar, but most said, âWe are here for Yogeshwar, and not for any political party.â An Arjuna awardee employed with the central government said, âWe have grown up with him in same akhadas, and our endeavour is to ensure his victory.â "
"BHUBANESWAR: BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaikâs action against MLA Pradeep Panigrahy for alleged job fraud has sparked off a political war of words in the state. While political observers feel Naveenâs action against his own MLA for alleged anti-people activities enhanced his Mr Clean image, the opposition BJP and Congress questioned the timing of Panigrahyâs expulsion from the BJD and his subsequent arrest. The opposition also feels that the action is a result of BJDâs intra-party rivalry and not crackdown on corruption. Jayant Mohapatra, a retired political science professor of Berhampur University, termed the action against the Gopalpur MLA as a very bold action. âBy taking action against the Gopalpur MLA for anti-people activities, the BJD president, who is also the chief minister, has sent a message that people are more important to him than any political leader, irrespective of his/her position in the party,â said Mohapatra. The professor said only time will tell the consequences of the action against Panigrahy. Senior Congress leader Suresh Routray said action against the Gopalpur MLA was initiated after he exposed the internal affairs of BJD in public. Even though he has been a victim of political conspiracy, Panigrahy cannot be called as a clean man, particularly after news reports of Rs 2.5 crore transaction in his account. âPanigrahy has been indulging in corruption since the past 20 years. How come was the chief minister unaware of all the corruption in the past two decades?,â said Routray. BJP leader Lekhashree Samantasinghar targeted the chief minister over corruption charges against Panigrahy. âYou (chief minister) have groomed a leader, who indulged in corruption and got all support from the government and administration since past many years. Now, the chief minister is trying to take credit by taking action against Panigrahy on corruption charges. If Panigrahy is guilty, the chief minister is equally guilty,â said Samantasinghar. Senior BJD leader and Berhampur mermber of parliament Chandra Sekhar Sahu said he welcomed the action against Panigrahy. As far as inquiry against the Gopalpur legislator is concerned, the law will take its own course, said the former Union minister. "
"PATNA: Politicians cutting across the party lines claimed that in the first phase, voting was done in favour of their candidates, which would pave way for their victory on November 10. Most of them congratulated the voters for exercising their franchise. JD (U) state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh congratulated everyone for coming out and voting amid Covid-19 pandemic, especially women voters. He said a large number of female voters on booths showed the impact of work done by chief minister Nitish Kumar. He further said the fight was between the 15-year rule of Nitish-led NDA government and that of Lalu-Rabri regime and added that the development work done by Nitishji with justice has left a deep impact on peopleâs mind. âThe very first phase has shown the mood of people. Once again the NDA government under the leadership of Nitish Kumar will be back with a huge mandate,â Singh said. Even BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal echoed the return of NDA government in Bihar. He said, âThe first phase election has made it clear that the NDA government is going to be formed. NDA contestants are getting peopleâs blessings.â However, Mahagatbandhan leaders claimed that their government will be formed this time. RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha said their alliance had got the peopleâs blessings and they will win at least 55 seats. âAdd five more. On the other hand, if NDA gets even 10 seats, it will be a big thing. Same will be the trend in the second and third phase ,â Jha added. Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala also predicted Mahagathbandhanâs victory. Through his tweet he said the change which people wanted was clear on the face of voters. The first phase voting is the first step towards the development of Bihar with the Grand Alliance. On the other hand, LJP national president Chirag Paswan in a tweet said that he had interacted with all his contestants after the first phase voting and they are happy. He said, âNovember 10 will bring a new dawn for Bihar. Voting done for a change will make your future better. All LJP candidates who win will support the BJP and form a BJP-LJP government.â "
"CHENNAI: A section of RMM is trying to organise a ""hunger fast"" at Valluvar Kottam in Nungambakkam on January 10 to pressure Rajinikanth to rethink his decision not to enter electoral politics.

A statement on Tuesday from R Ravichandran, South Chennai West district secretary of RMM, asked the functionaries and others not to participate in an event that is being organised by a section of RMM to press the actor to rethink. RMM district secretaries had decided to abide by whatever decision Rajinikanth takes, based on his health condition, he pointed out.

"HOWRAH: Minister of state for youth services and sports and former Bengal skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla quit all forms of politics on Tuesday, saying he wanted to concentrate more on sports, but did not resign as the Howrah (North) MLA. He wrote a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, apprising her of his decision. She responded, saying âthere is nothing wrong when a sportsperson wants to return to sports,â and sent a recommendation to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to ârelieveâ Shukla from the state cabinet. The party later replaced Shukla with Bhaskar Bhattacharya as its Howrah president. In writing to Banerjee and not the governor, Shukla chose to steer clear of the path taken by his former cabinet colleague, Suvendu Adhikari. BJP, however, indicated that the party was ready to embrace the former all-rounder. Banerjee stressed that there was âno room for any misunderstandingâ over Shuklaâs decision, adding, âAnyone can do this. Laxmi bhalo chhele (Laxmi is a good person). He has resigned. In his letter, he did not write about resigning as a minister. He wrote he wanted to quit all forms of politics for sports. He wants to spend more time in sports. He wants to continue as an MLA but wants to be relieved from everything else.... I want him to spend time in sports... he has our best wishes.â âI took the right decision at the right time, due to personal reasons,â Shukla told TOI. Reported informal conversations with close aides, however, indicate that something like this was long brewing. He reportedly said he didnât even get a single file to sign in the last four-and-a-half years as a minister; never got any administrative role; and that his recommendations as the partyâs Howrah president went unheeded for the past six months. Shukla reportedly told close aides that he was elected by people for five years and he wanted to respect the peopleâs mandate. Shuklaâs resignation â which coincided with state forest minister Rajib Banerjee skipping Tuesdayâs cabinet meeting, the fourth cabinet meeting in which he remained absent â threatened to bring to the fore rumblings within the Howrah district Trinamool Congress. In spite of what Banerjee, the party chief, said, senior minister and Howrah (South) MLA Arup Ray minced no words. âThis is like a soldier deserting the battlefield,â the party heavyweight said, adding, âThis is not the right time (for resigning). I met him at Pilkhana a few days back, and we spoke. He did mention he wanted to return to sports, but this isnât the time.â Domjur MLA and minister for forest affairs, Rajib Banerjee, said he hadnât spoken to Shukla in a while. âI will speak to him. The reasons (for his quitting) can only be explained by him.â Shukla was made the partyâs Howrah president replacing Ray, as the Trinamool tried to placate Banerjee. Three days after taking the partyâs charge in Howrah, Shukla had spoken to both Ray and Banerjee and sent a fresh panel of district leaders, which was reportedly âignoredâ, sources said. Bally MLA Vaishali Dalmiya, however, was outspoken. âLaxmi is like a brother to me. In politics, we work for people, but we also have self-respect. This is being attacked. There are some negative-minded people. These people held some posts sometime, but their only work now is to ridicule, insult and stop party MLAs from working. This must stop. These people must be got rid of, like termites, or they will weaken the party,â she said. Former Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty, a doctor who entered politics, refused to see this incident in isolation. âIt is our failure that we are unable to accommodate talents into politics,â he said. Sensing the discomfiture, BJP waded into the Shukla-resignation episode from multiple fronts. âA senior cricketer resigned today; wickets are falling every day,â BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. The partyâs spokesperson, Shamik Bhattacharya, said: âCricketers like Shukla are always welcome (to join BJP). People are leaving Trinamool Congress for it has outlived its ideology. It was a party born out of opposition to CPM. A decade on, it is no more relevant.â Shukla had joined Trinamool in February 2016 and was pitched against BJP heavyweight Roopa Ganguly in Howrah (North), which has a substantial non-Bengali-speaking people. A lateral entrant to politics, Shukla was never allowed a toehold in the partyâs Howrah leadership. Ray loyalists held on to the reins, a shackle which some leaders are trying to break away from. Incidentally, North Howrah is also seeing substantial BJP consolidation led by the Rai couple â Umesh, and his wife Gita. (With inputs by Sukumar Mahato in Behrampore) "
"AMBALA: Farm union BKU (Charuni) has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of plotting to give caste, communal, and religious colours to the farmersâ agitation against three central agri-marketing laws to scuttle it in northern Haryana. BKU (Charuni) said the seven farmers in the murder report registered at Naraingarh in Ambala after the death of a BJP rallyist are only Jats or Jatt Sikhs, which was to sideline Rajputs from the farmersâ agitation. The BJP supporter, Bharat Singh of Baragarh village, was a Rajput. Rajeev Sharma, farm unionâs Ambala district spokesman from Hasanpur village in Naraingarh block, said: âOur workers are from all communities and castes. In the case of Bharat Singh, the BJP forced his family to lodge a police complaint. To separate Rajputs from our organisation, the party tried to give the death a caste colour, and make it Rajputs versus Jats. But Rajputs understood this move.â "
"CHENNAI: No symbol of any political party or pictures of political leaders could be printed on the tokens issued by the state government for 2,500 Pongal cash gift, Madras high court has said. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the direction on Monday, while closing a public interest writ petition filed by the DMK. Printing pictures of political leaders in such state-sponsored schemes would amount to advertising the person concerned, the judges remarked. When the plea came up for hearing, advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted as per earlier directions of the court two circulars had been issued on December 30 to ration shops to ensure tokens with such pictures are not entertained. To this, senior advocate P Wilson for DMK requested the court to pass a direction or make an observation so that no pictures of political leaders are printed in the token. ""Pictures of chief minister, deputy chief minister and ministers of the respective districts are printed on the tokens or in attached sheets. Interestingly, the symbol of the Tamil Nadu government is not on the tokens,"" Wilson said. This apart, the tokens are being distributed by the members of the AIADMK across the state as if the party is making the payment. This amounts to canvassing for a political party at the cost of the exchequer, he said. According to the DMK, the tokens were issued with pictures of the chief minister, ministers and AIADMK symbol printed on them as if the gift is given by the ruling party. Chennai: No symbol of any political party or pictures of political leaders could be printed on the tokens issued by the state government for 2,500 Pongal cash gift, Madras high court has said. The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the direction on Monday, while closing a public interest writ petition filed by the DMK. Printing pictures of political leaders in such state-sponsored schemes would amount to advertising the person concerned, the judges remarked. When the plea came up for hearing, advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted as per earlier directions of the court two circulars had been issued on December 30 to ration shops to ensure tokens with such pictures are not entertained. To this, senior advocate P Wilson for DMK requested the court to pass a direction or make an observation so that no pictures of political leaders are printed in the token. ""Pictures of chief minister, deputy chief minister and ministers of the respective districts are printed on the tokens or in attached sheets. Interestingly, the symbol of the Tamil Nadu government is not on the tokens,"" Wilson said. This apart, the tokens are being distributed by the members of the AIADMK across the state as if the party is making the payment. This amounts to canvassing for a political party at the cost of the exchequer, he said. According to the DMK, the tokens were issued with pictures of the chief minister, ministers and AIADMK symbol printed on them as if the gift is given by the ruling party. "
"KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday used the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and the ONGCâs request for land in Ashokenagar-Barrackpore to drive home the point that she was ready to go beyond politics and cooperate with the Centre for peopleâs welfare and Bengalâs economic development. The CM said she had written â and spoken â to Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar, saying Bengal was ready to verify the 21.7 lakh farmer-applicants who had registered in the central portal, as directed by the Centre on November 6. âI want farmers to get the money. If they get anything extra, let them,â she said. Banerjee said it was being alleged that Bengal didnât send data (on farmers). âBut we couldnât have done that since farmers have applied directly in the PM-Kisan portal. If it is a question of verifying these, we will do it. I have asked (the Union agriculture minister) for the data. We never had it in the first place. Itâs all politics. But, to me, a farmerâs interest precedes everything,â she said. The chief minister said she had written to Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, saying the state would give ONGC 48 acres of land in Ashokenagar and another plot in Barrackpore for three years for further oil exploration. âThey (ONGC) wanted to pay. But we will give the land for free,â she said. Banerjee said there were 300 families settled on the plots, which are mostly owned by the state, adding the state government has approached the Centre for a special rehabilitation package for them. âWe do not want money (for the land),â Banerjee said, adding she was âhappy that the state and the Centre could do this togetherâ. âThis effort,â she said, would âput Bengal firmly on the world energy map. The Bengal Basin, as well as the Deucha Panchami coal block, will ensure that Bengal faces no energy crisis for the next century.â ONGC, she said, had already invested Rs 3,361 crore for exploration for the last four years and planned to invest another Rs 425 crore in the next two years for âinstallation of a quick production system with green belt area and allied infrastructure.â Addressing the press on the politically contentious PM-Kisan scheme, the CM said: âI had spoken to the Union agriculture minister. Bengalâs agriculture minister could have spoken to him, but I did. You can gauge the seriousness we gave it. The PM referred to this. Hotath election year-e ekta Bangla-Bangla bhaab esheche (Bengal is suddenly the flavour this election season) This is nothing unnatural. This will stay for the next two-three months. âIn my earlier letters (to Tomar), we had asked for the funds which could be sent to farmers by Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT) mode. In this, the Centre credits funds to the state treasury, which is sent to the beneficiaries. This is audited by CAG. Reports must be given to the state assembly, too. Tomarji told me, âhumlog direct karenge (we will do it directly)â. I sensed the politics behind it. To me, what could be more important? Two-lakh letters by the Prime Minister to the farmers, or them getting some extra money? So, I wrote back that the state would help them getting the verification done, as asked for in their November 6 letter. We have asked for the data,â the CM said. Banerjee reminded everyone that Bengal already had a scheme â Krisak Bandhu â in place for farmers. âAlong with the one-time benefits, this is available to small and marginal farmers who have land holdings of an acre or less. This scheme reaches out to 70 lakh farmers in Bengal. The central scheme can be availed of by those who have two acres or more. They have said that 21.7 lakh people have applied; it will leave out the others. But let them get whatever help they get. Now, if they say they cannot trust Bengal to verify the data, we can do nothing.â She chief minister said the ONGC project would be of immense help to industries, giving the example of the nearby IOCL refinery, which âhas a capacity for eight million tonnes per annum, but which now has to import crude oil,â adding, âThis holds enormous potential for Bengal.â In the Deucha Panchami coal block, she said work would begin on land which is vested with the state and has no homes. âThe survey for others will begin. We will first work on rehabilitation packages, alternative land and jobs and then work with peopleâs confidence. This would be much later.â "
"ThiRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has alleged that CPM is trying to weaken UDF to pave the way for BJPâs growth in the state. âCPM and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan are trying to destabilize religious harmony by playing the communal card. They are in fact triggering a fight between communal groups in the state,â he said. By attacking Indian Union Muslim League, CPM has made its intentions clear: it wants to divide people in the name of the religion, Chennithala said. In the local body election, CPM had taken several decisions in favour of BJP. In over hundred wards it had a secret truck with SDPI and BJP. CPM believes that communal polarization will work to its advantage in the assembly polls as well. People will reject this ploy, he said. Chennithala slammed claims that UDF had disintegrated as a result of a terrible defeat in the local body polls. âThis is an attempt to mislead people. The KPCC research and development wingâs analysis of the results revealed UDF had secured more votes than LDF,â he said âWhile UDF bagged 35.6% votes, the LDF vote share stood at 34.96%. The reality is UDF and LDF share the balance of political power in the state. However, LDF wants to cover up this fact and mislead the people.â The Congress leader said all the allegations of wrongdoing levelled against the state government still stand and people are aware of this. However, UDF did not succeed in making the allegations a plank in the recently held polls, during which only local issues were highlighted. But this will not be the case in the assembly election, he said. "
"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The political affairs committee of KPCC will meet on Wednesday and the meeting assumes significance as it will decide strategies that have to be followed in the ensuing local body elections. Though UDF has decided not to have alliance outside the front with political parties, it has decided to have a local-level understanding. KPCC will take a decision on this matter. Already, Welfare Party has decided to have a local-level understanding with UDF in the local body election. The meet also assumes significance as leaders like K Muraleedharan and VM Sudheeran were complaining that partyâs policy decisions are not discussed in the party forum. They had alleged that all decisions are taken by one or two leaders. The exit of Jose K Mani faction will also be discussed.  Senior leaders are of the view that there was no attempt from the party leaders to have a dialogue with Jose to prevent the factionâs exit from the front. Thomas faction to hold talks with UDF Kerala Congress (PC Thomas) faction has decided to hold talks with UDF after its party secretariat decided to severe ties with NDA. Party chairman PC Thomas said the group will not put forward conditions and that he was happy to join the front that has PJ Joseph as an ally. When asked whether he would like to merge with Joseph group, Thomas said, âA dispute is going on and it is who is the real Kerala Congress (M), this is happening between Joseph and Jose K Mani. Let that issue get settled first.â He also said that he wants to bring various KC factions in UDF under one Kerala Congress. However, the time is not right for that, he added. He said that the name Kerala Congress is officially allotted to him and it will be an added advantage in his efforts to bring together various Kerala Congress factions in UDF. Earlier, Thomas said that he was quitting NDA after his party was not given the promised chairman post of the rubber board and five membership for his party leaders in various boards. "
"Kozhikode: LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan claimed that IUML was engaging in communal politics and trying to achieve religious consolidation by deliberately resorting to false propaganda against the government over its decision to provide 10% job reservation for economically-weaker sections among forward communities. Addressing the media in Malappuram on Monday, Vijayaraghavan alleged that the party was trying to communalize all issues and has accepted the tutelage of extreme communal forces. âOpposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and KPCC President Mullappally Ramachandran should clarify if they also endorse the stand of IUML on the reservation issue,â he said. Vijayaraghavan said that Parliament had passed the bill for providing reservation to economically-weaker sections among forward castes in January 2019 and it is being implemented by state governments. âIt is a central law and does not come under the purview of the state government. Now, IUML is trying to mobilize protests on the matter against the state government,â he said, adding that while some organisations had approached the Supreme Court on the matter, IUML has not done so. He alleged that IUML was resorting to dangerous politics of communalizing people and trying to mobilizing them against LDF government following the realization that even the sections âwho were traditionally behind the party â were now thinking of aligning with LDF. âWhat IUML is attempting is dangerous politics of polarizing people on communal lines. The people of Kerala will not accept it,"" he added. Last week, the cabinet approved 10% reservation in government jobs for economically-weaker sections in the general category. A meeting of the leaders of various Muslim organizations held at Panakkad on Sunday had decided to launch a joint agitation against the reservation for forward castes with the cooperation of likeminded organizations.

"WASHINGTON: The release on Sunday by US media of a stunning audio tape in which President Donald Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his election defeat there to Democrat Joe Biden sent shockwaves across Washington. The tape, a rebel push by scores of Republican lawmakers to challenge Biden's electoral win later this week, a pair of runoff elections in Georgia to decide control of the US Senate and expected pro-Trump protests in Washington are combining to set the stage for a fiery week in American politics. Lawmakers got back to work Sunday on Capitol Hill, where Democrat Nancy Pelosi was narrowly reelected as speaker of the House of Representatives, but the real political fireworks are to come later in the week. Following the release of the recording, Democrats and a few Republicans heaped scorn on the outgoing president, who fired off a tweetstorm of unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the November 3 election. The taped conversation between Trump and fellow Republican Brad Raffensperger, first obtained by The Washington Post, includes vague threats by Trump that Raffensperger and another official could face ""a big risk"" if they failed to take moves toward overturning Biden's victory. ""There's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated"" the vote tally, Trump is heard saying on the tape. ""You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes."" Raffensperger is heard responding: ""Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong."" Biden won the long Republican-leaning state by fewer than 12,000 votes -- a narrow margin, but one that has remained unchanged through a series of recounts and audits. ""The current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right?"" Trump says. ""So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes."" Making Trump's call more surprising is the fact that even a hypothetical reversal in Georgia, which has 16 Electoral College votes, would not overturn victory by Biden, who won by a margin of 306 to 232. Ahead of the release of the audio, Trump tweeted about the call, saying that Raffensperger ""was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the 'ballots under table' scam, ballot destruction, out of state 'voters', dead voters, and more."" Raffensperger tweeted back, also ahead of the release of the audio, saying: ""Respectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out."" After the release, the White House declined to comment. Democrats reacted furiously. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris slammed it as ""the voice of desperation"" and a ""bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the President of the United States"" during a rally in Savannah, Georgia. One moderate Republican, Congressman Adam Kinzinger, tweeted: ""This is absolutely appalling. To every member of Congress considering objecting to the election results, you cannot -- in light of this -- do so with a clean conscience."" It was unclear what impact the tape's release might have on the twin runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday, which will decide who controls the US Senate. Both Trump and Biden are due to appear at rallies in the southern state on Monday. Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are facing off against Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively. Victory by Ossoff and Warnock would give Democrats, and Biden, a major boost -- Senate seats would be evenly divided between the parties at 50 each, but incoming Vice President Harris would wield a tie-breaking vote. Democrats already control the House. ""This is going to be a very tough battle but it is absolutely within the realm of possibility -- in fact, the realm of likelihood -- the Democrats can win,"" Stacey Abrams, the charismatic former Georgia lawmaker who has emerged as a party leader, told CNN on Sunday. News of the Trump tape came hours after the US Congress opened its new session Sunday. Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in the history of US politics, will serve another term as speaker of the House after her reelection. Congress will convene in a rare joint session on Wednesday to certify Biden's election result -- but it will not be the usual dry pro forma affair. So far, 12 Republican senators loyal to Trump have announced plans to block certification, instead demanding the formation of a special commission to do an ""emergency"" election audit. With Democrats controlling the House and many Senate Republicans expected to confirm Biden's victory, the rebel effort is all but certain to fail, but it has raised tensions on Capitol Hill. It has also underscored a sharp divide within the president's party, as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has asked his caucus to respect the Electoral College result. Senator Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential candidate, called the campaign an ""egregious ploy"" that served only to ""enhance the political ambition of some."" He and a bipartisan coalition of senators on Sunday called on Congress to certify the result, saying: ""The 2020 election is over... It is time to move forward."" Pro-Trump protesters not quite willing to concede are expected to rally in Washington on Wednesday. Trump, who has urged thousands to support his cause, tweeted Sunday: ""I will be there. Historic day!"" "
"NEW DELHI: An evening at his 10, Rajaji Marg residence, soon after he demitted office as the 13th President of India in 2017, Pranab Mukherjee was in a chatty mood, typical of an 'adda-loving' Bengali, busy mostly with writing his book (Coalition years) and his endless reading, in the autumn of his almost 50-year-long hectic political career, that began in 1969. In a freewheeling conversation session, he enlightened us, (three journalists) on little known facts about the first general elections in 1952. A candidate in West Bengal had chewed up a ballot paper that went in his rivalâs favour, after the counting showed that the two highest scorers had finished with equal number of votes. So, he won after a recount (the system had not evolved a remedy for an unprecedented situation as this). After a hearty laugh over the story, Mukherjee came up with another gem from the 1952 election vintage. Many contestants... different symbols. A village voter, who supported one with a banyan tree as his symbol, went up to the big banyan tree in his village after casting his vote and left the ballot paper in the trunk of the tree, to elect his candidate. This is what he had gathered from the governmentâs efforts to educate voters for the first-time exercise. No google search could throw up such historical treasures â never-ending stream of anecdotes â that flowed out from this short, lean, man, known for his deep knowledge and elephantine memory, that often made him âindispensableâ for his party, his government, to journalists and even scholars of our political system, for half a century. Pranab Mukherjee knew his Sanskrit shlokas as well as the Indian Constitution. They were etched in his memory like some of his favourite Bengali poems from Tagore to the contemporary. A thorough Congressman, he was best of friends with some of his contemporary Communist leaders like Jyoti Basu to Sitaram Yechury. He enjoyed a cordial relationship with socialists and BJP leaders. If he started his day with two hours of uninterrupted prayers â reciting the Chandi and performing daily rituals at the alter â he always carried a copy of the Constitution in his black attache and swore by it. âWe are actually using this book each and every moment of our lives,â he had told a journalist long years ago. Once in Lok Sabha during the A B Vajpayee regime, Mukherjee as opposition leader, had to defend his benches in a debate that touched upon the drunken behaviour of some of the Hindu gods and goddesses, against the ruling BJP. Pranab's contention that the scriptures indeed contained such references outraged the saffron brigade who rose to protest in unison against the Opposition leader's irreverent attitude towards providence. Mukherjee rattled off relevant shlokas with appropriate English translations. That ended the debate. Like a typical temperamental teacher, âPranab daâ as he was referred to by those familiar with him, never held himself back from yelling at anyone who seemed ill-informed, unprepared or ignorant â journalist or colleague, senior or junior â with a query for which answers could only come from him. âWhy donât you do your homework, am I here to educate you, first know your facts, do some homework...â was a common refrain from a visibly angry man, to journalists looking for a story. But, it would not take him long to cool down, even provide valuable information, as regulars at his durbar had figured out after some practice â he had to be wired away to another subject, preferably one that interests him or ask for his perspective rather than fire at point-blank for specific information. Shouted at or not, they always returned to the man of all seasons â in government or in opposition â for he was a good teacher and the students knew it. When in government, late night appointments at his home office at 13, Talkatora Road, was typical for journalists, politicos and other callers. Before he retired for the day, Mukherjee unfailingly wrote a page or two in his closely guarded diary narrating the day's important meetings and incidents. A keen student of history, he knew the importance of these diaries as primary source material for any scholar keen to delve into the country's political history of his times. On the last day of office in Parliament before he was filing for the Presidential elections, he found time for an interview with the TOI. The slotted 10 minutes went off into half an hour of wonderful conversation, only because the reporter was prompt in recalling the name of a book in Bengali by historian Tapan Ray Choudhury, when he was fumbling for it. That changed the atmospherics for a charming interaction. Not surprisingly, the master of political play had great admiration for Chanakya or Kautilya. He had not only read the Arthasashtra but most books till date on the man and his works. One of the things he carried to the Rashtrapati Bhawan from his Talkatora Road home office and to Rajaji Marg was a portrait of the medieval Indian Machiavelli, that hung on the wall. A young journalist asked him âwhat happened at the cabinet meetingâ when he was a member of PV Narasimha Raoâs team. The reply was curt and swift, âwhat happened at the cabinetâ¦ you expect me to tell you...donât you know I am under oathâ¦â The journalist learnt his lesson. The next time he kept his questions to just two listed cabinet agenda and simply asked about the ministerâs views on the issue, without mentioning the cabinet meetingâ¦ it worked. Without dishonouring the oath of office, Mukherjee explained the issues, providing all the clues needed to run the story. A voracious reader since childhood, the man who built his career first as a professor of economics at Vidyasagar College, Kolkata (1963) and then in politics, with knowledge as his capital, Mukherjee could never sit idle without reading. The range was from official files to books on history, politics, economics or diplomacy, a biography or a memoir, a newspaper or a magazine, to a bestseller in English or Bengali. This habit, backed by a graphic memory and a rare capacity to slog for long hours was his core strength. For one who was not a mass leader, having lost many elections before he won the Lok Sabha in 2004, Pranab Mukherjee â âThe Man who knew much, if not Too Muchâ about the labyrinth that is Indiaâs politics and governance for almost half a Century, made his way through its choppy waters, with distinction essentially for his understanding of the crisis and the immense ability to deal with it.

"BHUBANESWAR: Justice (retired) Raghunath Biswal on Saturday took charge as chairman of the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes (OSCBC) along with three other members. The move is seen as a precursor to the backward classes survey which the state government has been advocating for a while. The commission will formally start functioning from a temporary office almost a year after it was announced. The state government had on February 12 last year announced the constitution of the OSCBC in accordance with the provisions of the Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 1993. The state assembly in February had also passed a resolution to conduct a survey of the backward classes by the OSCBC as the last caste-based census was done way back in 1931. âThe key function of the commission will be to include eligible castes left out from the backward list and to exclude those who have been found to have developed socially and economically over the years. We will prepare a database of backward class population in the state,â Biswal said. On providing quota to backward classes, Biswal said it can only be decided after detailed examination of various aspects. Functioning of the OSCBC assumes significance as it comes in the wake of a proposal passed during a recent BJD meeting to conduct the survey of backward classes in the state while Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan also wrote a letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik seeking reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) in public recruitment and educational institutions and to socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs) in educational institutions. The politics over reservation of backward classes is seen as an attempt to rally the community, whose number is perceived to be half of the stateâs population. Though there has been no official enumeration in the recent past, percentage of backward class population is thought to be around 54% of the population. There are around 209 communities identified as backward classes in the state. State SC/ST development and backward classes welfare minister Jagannath Sarka, who was present when the commission chairman took charge, said the state government would act upon the suggestions made by the OSCBC. Pradhan on Saturday also accused the state government of not having political will to provide quota to backward classes in the state. âMajority of the population in the state belongs to OBC and SEBC sections. These sections of the society are getting deprived of their rights in public recruitment and education as a result of which they could not develop socially and educationally,â Pradhan said. "
"CHENNAI: The elections are around the corner and political graffiti and posters are hogging all the space, sometimes even erasing old murals creating awareness on conserving water and the environment. For instance, the compound wall of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board on Greenways Road, had murals on water conservation. But, a large part of it is now defaced and has paintings and posters of the ruling party and others. âWe spent â¹88,000 on these murals and all our work vanished overnight,â said Arun Krishnamurthy, founder of the Environmentalist Foundation of India. Arun said the aim behind the murals was to inform the public about the importance of water and about the birds found along the Adyar. Several political posters have come up along Greenways Road where chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, his deputy OPanneerselvam, other ministers and many high court judges reside. While the paintings were not found outside their premises, they were present on a few walls of residential complexes on the opposite side and a few metres from the state human rights commission office. âOne night I stepped out for a walk and saw a few men pasting posters on the walls of our apartment complex. When I intervened, they began arguing. They left after n I told them that I would complain,â said a resident of the road. Many walls were defaced on Bishop Garden, Mylapore Tank Road, Pasump on Muthuramalinga Thevar Road with signboards also being used for political posters. In 2016, the Madras high court had said those violating the Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1959 will face contempt. âThe corporation and police can take action against violators and for that to happen one has to complain. This is happening in the presence of police officers who fear the party workers and stay quiet,â said V S Suresh, advocate at the Madras high court. Officials from the corporation said they have received a few complaints and have begun whitewashing defaced walls. AIADMK Chennai south (east) district secretary M K Ashok said , âWe have a standing instruction from our ministers to not deface walls. We shall look into it.â "
"MADURAI: M K Alagiri, the former Union minister and elder brother of DMK president M K Stalin, has scheduled a meeting on Sunday with supporters from across the state, to discuss the launch of a new political party. Senior DMK leaders, however, say they are not perturbed by the move. The meeting is scheduled between 4 pm and 7 pm at a marriage hall in Madurai. Alagiri supporter Isakkimuthu said what supporters of Alagiri really wanted was for the DMK to reconsider his inclusion in the party. âWe as a team have proved our might in elections, not just once but many times, and we can be the driving force in the southern districts,â he said. M L Raj, another supporter said if the decision was taken to launch a new party then the announcement for it would be made on âAnnanâsâ birthday on January 30. Said a DMK leader seeking anonymity, âAlagiri is a shrewd politician. He will not take the plunge without knowing his strength.â Senior DMK leader T K S Elangovan said even if Alagiri started a new party, it would have no impact on the DMK and its prospects in the forthcoming assembly election. âBeing the son of the leader of the party, he (Alagiri) had some supporters. After he was removed from the party, however, the cadres returned to the party. Except for a handful, he has no cadre following and he would have no impact on the DMK,â said Elangovan.

"COIMBATORE: DMK president M K Stalin on Saturday vowed to quit politics if he failed to prove the corruption charges against Tamil Nadu municipal administration minister S P Velumani. Responding to Velumani's challenge to prove the charges, Stalin said, ""I am ready to quit politics. Are you (Velumani) ready?"" The DMK chief was addressing a gram sabha meeting at Devarayapuram in Thondamuthur constituency represented by the minister. Referring to the memorandum submitted by the DMK to the governor last month listing the charges against the chief minister E Palaniswami and his colleagues, Velumani had said he would step down from his post if the charges were proved and sought to know whether Stalin was ready to quit politics if he failed to do so. ""We will not only prove the charges against the minister but also drag him to the court of law and get him punished for his corrupt deeds..."" Stalin said. Stalin promised to order an inquiry into the death of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa since the judicial commission constituted by the government has not submitted its report even after three years, immediately afterassuming power. The DMK leader mocked the AIADMK for announcing K Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate as its alliance partner BJP was yet to endorse it. Though the state government had banned gram sabha meetings, the party was holding people's gram sabha meetings and lauded the participation in large numbers, as they had given a big mandate to DMK in the last Lok Sabha and local body elections. Reacting to Stalin's remarks, Velumani reiterated his resolve to resign from all posts in the government and AIADMK if the charges levelled against him were proved. Speaking to reporters at the ESI Hospital on the sidelines of a special camp for dry run of Covid-19 vaccine, the Local Administration Minister accused the DMK chief of making corruption charges and indulging in slandering the former's image as part of a political vendetta. Velumani said he was ready to submit his resignation from the post of MLA, minister and party posts if he was found guilty of graft. At the same time, he said, Stalin who is spreading lies should explain whether he is ready to step down from the party post and the opposition leader's post. ""Stalin has no right to talk about corruption, and if he has courage he should accept my challenge and prove the charges,"" Velumani said. He condemned Stalin for allegedly asking his goons to silence a Dalit woman, who raised questions on DMK's alleged failure to implement its election promises, during the people's gram sabha meeting organised at Thondamuthur in Coimbatore. ""It is not acceptable to attack a woman in my district and Stalin has to reply to this,"" Velumani said. Meanwhile, a video of the woman, said to be an AIADMK functionary who raised questions at the meeting and also talking to a Minister over the cellphone, went viral in the social media. The video purportedly shows a man handing over the phone to her and stating that the Minister was at the other end. She narrated the incident by saying she had gone to a temple in the area and heard Stalin making unnecessary comments against Velumani. She added that because she was unable to bear it, she started raising questions. "
"Haveri: Teachers and graduates will support Congress in the forthcoming council election because of unemployment, corruption and anti-people policies of the state and Union governments,â said Congress leader HK Patil here on Friday. âBJP has not been upholding values of democracy and ruling party in the state and Centre has insulted the parliamentary system. They have introduced anti-people policies by ordinance without discussions in the houses. The state government has amended the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 2020 to help capitalists and thrown farmers welfare to the wind,â he alleged. The former minister criticised BJP for promising a free Covid-19 vaccine in its poll manifesto in Bihar. âThis is low level politics. Everyone should get Covid vaccination in our nation and there shouldnât be any differentiation in such a serious matter. But BJP is tempting the people of Bihar before the assembly election,â he said. âI urge the registered graduates in the Karnataka West Graduates constituency to cast their first preference votes to our candidate Prof RM Kuberappa, he will serve the welfare of unemployed graduates,â he appealed. DCC president MM Hiremath, former minister Rudrappa Lamani, candidate RM Kuberappa, ZP member Kotreshappa Baseganni and others were present. "
"CHENNAI: Seeking to script a historic win in the 2021 assembly election by propagating its achievements with the tagline, Vetrinadaipodum Tamilagam (Tamil Nadu on a victorious path), the ruling AIADMK is raking up 'dynastic politics' and the 2G scam to counter the perceived anti-incumbency against the government. Since Union home minister Amit Shah also took a jibe at the DMK, accusing it of promoting 'dynastic politics', it could well be the poll theme for the AIADMK-led alliance in the coming weeks. With DMK out of power for a decade, the AIADMK leaders have been urging voters ""to reject dynastic politics"", accusing the DMK's ""first family"" of calling the shots. Campaigning in Thiruverumbur in Trichy, the bastion of DMK strongman K N Nehru, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said DMK's senior leaders were being sidelined in favour of the ""family members"" who have been campaigning against his government. The DMK had become a 'corporate firm' and a 'monarchy,' where the first family alone could enjoy power and position. Law minister C Ve Shanmugam said, ""The DMK has been prioritizing dynastic politics rather than focusing on public welfare. People should choose democracy and peace over dynasty politics and anarchy of the DMK."" Palaniswami told reporters in Madurai, en route to Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, that DMK chief M K Stalin's son Udhayanidhi had entered politics and his grandson was ready too. The 2021 assembly election would end dynasty politics, he said. Indicting that raking up dynastic politics was like flogging a dead horse, DMK treasurer S Durai Murugan said the issue has not evoked any response from the people. ""Only those who have real interest in politics and are ready to sacrifice for people's welfare will survive. Ability, hard work and charisma of Stalin has taken him to greater heights. This talk of dynastic politics will not succeed at the hustings,"" the DMK leader said. As the senior leaders are busy in their respective districts convening the 'makkal gram sabhas' (people's village meetings) in panchayats to reject the AIADMK, Udhayanidhi Stalin and Kanimozhi have hit the trail as the DMK's key campaigners. Durai Murugan said the special court had acquitted former telecom minister A Raja and others in the 2G case as there was no evidence, and only an appeal has been made in the Delhi high court. DMK deputy general secretary Raja had recently challenged the chief minister to a public debate on who was corrupt and on the 2G case. He alleged that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa was convicted in a disproportionate assets case. "
"NANDIGRAM: The Trinamool Congress governmentâs decision to remove Soumendu Adhikari as Contai Municipality board of administrators (BoA) chairperson has triggered a redrawing of East Midnaporeâs political fault lines with Soumendu, along with 14 other civic councillors, defecting to BJP on Friday in elder brother Suvenduâs presence in Kanthi dormitory ground, an Adhikari family stronghold. Suvenduâs âthe lotus has only bloomedâ and âRam Navami abhi baki hai (there is still time for Ram Navami)â statements in Nandigram earlier in the day fuelled speculations on whether the Adhikari satrap, Sisir, and his son Dibyendu, both Trinamool MPs, will follow Suvendu and Soumenduâs lead to switch political allegiance. The removal of Soumendu, who was helming Contai Municipality for the last decade, has already prompted a reticent Dibyendu to write to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and publicly question the move, sources said. In 1969, Sisir first stepped into the municipality as its commissioner. Since then, an Adhikari has always headed the civic body for 45 years, and without a break since 1986. Suvendu said: âThis is not about being my brother. Soumendu has worked for the municipality for a decade. Even I was a two-time councillor here. People know what we did.â Referring to the Contai South assembly segment, also a family bastion, which Sisir first won in 1982 and which has always elected an Adhikari since 2001, Suvendu said: âIn the 2017 bypoll, BJP had lost this election by 19,000 votes. Today, 5,000 supporters are joining BJP. If they even have four votes in their families, from today we have reversed the lead.â In 2017, Trinamool had handpicked Chandrima Bhattacharya to contest the Contai South bypoll overlooking Soumendu. The seat was vacated after Dibyendu won the Tamluk Lok Sabha bypoll in 2016. To consolidate their position, Trinamool has already sounded out Sisir loyalist and Bhagabanpur MLA Ardhendu Maiti to succeed Suvendu as the Haldia Development Authority (HAD) chairperson and two-time Nandigram MLA Firoza Biwi to contest from Nandigram again in 2021. Ardhendu said: âI received a call (to assume charge as HDA chairperson). I will do so on Monday.â Firoza, who lost her son Imdadul Sk in the March 2007 Nandigram police firing, was handpicked by Suvendu to contest the 2009 bypoll in Nandigram. Firoza only said: âIâm busy with the party foundation day programme. I have nothing to say.â Both Ardhendu and Firoza had earlier stressed that their political allegiance is with Mamata Banerjee and Trinamool. The possibility of Firoza contesting from Nandigram again and anticipating a possible split in his supporter base in minority-dominated Nandigram-1 block, Suvendu announced he will hold a lakh-strong rally on January 8 in Nandigram. âEvery locality has to send 5,000 people. I will provide whatever buses are required. If anyone is stopped, call me, I will come to you,â he said here on Friday. Suvendu, however, did not iterate his âjihadiâ barb at the Friday meeting, referring to the December 29 attack on 15 BJP supporters in Nandigram. But he said: âReligions teach us to respect other religions. Why would anyone attack women and children who were coming to have prasad?â He added: âIn 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP workers had won 18 seats even after being assaulted. They had taken a lead in 100 assembly seats. We will reverse the results in which BJP trailed. We start this from Kanthi today.â "
"PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Friday said there was no political crisis in his government. He said this in response to a media query after a series of review meetings with senior officials of different departments on the New Year. When a journalist asked, âIs any political crisis looming over (your government), Sir?â Nitish quickly replied, âNo, not at all.â Earlier in the day, former Bihar CM and RJD leader Rabri Devi said Nitishâs writ no longer ran in the government he was heading and it was the BJP, his numerically stronger ally, which was calling the shots. RJD has been trying to goad Nitish to quit the NDA, following the recent defection of six JD(U) MLAs to BJP in Arunachal Pradesh. âHe (Nitish) should have thought carefully before taking oath as the CM with the support of his bigger ally BJP,â Rabri told reporters. Nitishâs JD(U) has only 43 MLAs, compared to BJPâs 74 and 75 of RJD. The NDA has total 125 MLAs in the 243-member assembly. âAll those officers who have been loyal to Nitish are likely to be sidelined in the days to come,â Rabri told reporters while referring to major bureaucratic reshuffle on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, Nitish had rubbished his former minister and now RJD leader Shyam Rajakâs claim that 17 JD(U) MLAs were in touch with his party leaders. âOnce, their number will go up to 28, the two-third number of total JD(U) MLAs, they can defect to the RJD,â Rajak had claimed. Nitish on Friday categorically said that no political crisis was looming over his government. CM holds series of review meetsUnlike previous years when Nitish, as the CM, used to meet his cabinet colleagues, political workers and even common people at his residential office to exchange the New Yearâs greetings on the first day of a calendar year; he on Friday chose to visit his office at the secretariat and held a series of review meetings with senior officials of different departments. Nitish went to his office on Friday after several months. In recent months, especially during the Covid-19 period, he used to hold a majority of meetings from his residential office. Even the cabinet meetings used to take place at the CM secretariat. The CM spending too much time at the main secretariat led to speculations in political circles that something âunusualâ might happen in the state government. However, Nitish said after the meetings, âEarlier, I used to come here (at the main secretariatâs office) on a regular basis. Once again, I have thought about executing my work while sitting here. Therefore, I decided to begin this exercise from today itself. Henceforth, I will come here at least a day in a week and discharge my duty from the main secretariat office.â While reviewing the works of the rural development department and the Jeevika, the CM asked the officials to ensure that the canteens of all district-level Sadar hospitals are managed and run by the Jeevika didis. The CM also inaugurated a new âLok Sewa Kendraâ on the âSuchna Bhavanâ premises through videoconferencing from his main secretariat office. "
"PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday said there is no political crisis in his government. He said this in response to a media personâs query while coming out of the main secretariat where he held a series of review meetings with senior officials of different departments on the first day of the New Year. When a journalist asked, âIs any political crisis looming over (your government), Sir?â Nitish quickly replied, âNo, not at all.â Earlier on Wednesday, Nitish had rubbished the JD(U)-turned-RJD leader and former minister Shyam Rajakâs claim of 17 JD(U) MLAs being in touch with the RJD leaders. Responding to a media query after inspection of the Rajdhani Sarovar in the state capital , the CM had on Wednesday said, âWhat the opposition is saying is baseless. There is no such thing.â Rajak had on Wednesday claimed that altogether 17 MLAs of ruling JD(U) were in touch with the RJD leaders. âOnce, their number will go up to 28, the two-third number of total JD(U) MLAs, they can defect to the RJD,â Rajak had claimed. However, Nitish on Friday categorically said that no political crisis was looming over his government. The ruling JD (U) has 43 MLAs in the 243-member house. The NDA currently holds 125 seats in the assembly, while opposition parties -the RJD, the Congress and the Left parties have 75 and 19 and 16 MLAs, respectively. Unlike previous years when Nitish, as the CM, used to meet his cabinet colleagues, political workers and even common people at his residential office at 1, Anney Marg, to exchange the New Yearâs greetings on the first day of a calendar year; he today chose to go to his office at the main secretariat and held a series of review meetings with senior officials of different departments. Nitish went to his office at the main secretariat on Friday after a gap of several months.

Rabri Devi, the national vice president of the RJD and Lalu Prasad's wife, was replying to queries from the media persons about the recent bureaucratic reshuffle in which some officers believed to be close to the political heavyweights have been divested of the plum posts they had reportedly been holding for a long time. âThe writ of Nitish Kumar no longer runs in his own government. He should have thought carefully before taking oath as the CM with the support of his bigger ally BJP,â Rabri told reporters while taking a swipe at the CM. Nitish took oath as the CM in November last year, despite his party securing only 43 seats, much less than the 74 of the BJP, in the assembly polls. âAll those officers who have been loyal to Nitish Kumar and known to be having his interests in mind are likely to be sidelined in the days to come,â Rabri told reporters.

"Panaji: Goaâs leader of opposition and ex-CM Digambar Kamat on Thursday slammed Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for promising free Covid vaccines for Bihar as part of BJPâs poll promises for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. âIt is unfortunate that the Union finance minister is politicising the Covid pandemic and is using the vaccine, which is yet to come, to gain political mileage in the Bihar elections. Who authorised the BJP government to be selective in distribution of the vaccine and on what basis,â he said. Kamat went to the extent of saying that Sitharaman, after pushing the country towards âfinancial bankruptcyâ, is showing âmental bankruptcyâ by suggesting that the Covid vaccine can be selectively supplied to states. âCovid vaccine is the right of every citizen and no one can play politics about it by being selective,â he said. Congress said that Sitharaman must explain whether the Centre expects other states to pay for the vaccine or if BJP wants people from other states to wait till their respective elections for the vaccine. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte also criticised Sitharamanâs statement. "
"MUMBAI: A day after the Maharashtra government issued a notification withdrawing its general consent to the Central Bureau of Investigation, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said the decision was taken as the premier agency âwas being used to settle political scores and there was suspicion that just like in the past, the TRP scam case, being investigated by the Mumbai police, may be handed over to the CBI.â âCBI is a professional agency, but of late it has been used to settle political scores. A complaint in the TRP case has been registered in UP, and it is rumoured that due to political pressure, there could be an attempt to combine all the cases and to give them to CBI. To prevent misuse of the general consent, we decided to revoke it,â Deshmukh said. He said there have been instances where the Supreme Court, in some of its judgements, has taken objection to the CBIâs ways of functioning. âThey have been called âcaged parrotsâ by some SC judges. This shows that these agencies are being misused,â Deshmukh said. The Maharashtra government had issued general consent to the CBI in 1989. The Sena-NCP-Congress governmentâs withdrawal has marked an upping of tensions with the Centre. âWith the withdrawal, CBI cannot probe any cases in Maharashtra without prior consent of the state,â Deshmukh said, adding that a few other states like Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim, too, had issued such orders. The CBI on Tuesday took over the probe in the TRP case lodged in Lucknow on the recommendation of the UP government. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the state government had to take a decision to withdraw general consent to the federal agency as it was seen that the Centre was interfering in matters pertaining to Maharashtra. âMany states have already issued such orders, Maharashtraâs patience was tested, and it has much later issued such an order,â Raut said. Ongoing investigations such as the one in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, however, will not be impacted by the stateâs notification as it cannot be applied retrospectively. The stateâs public works minister Ashok Chavan had told TOI on Wednesday that the general consent had been withdrawn because of apprehension that the TRP case would be taken over. "
"BENGALURU: This year was tough for the world and even more so for politicians. Unlike a majority of employees in the organised sector who worked from home when the pandemic was at its peak, politicians hardly stayed indoors as their work required constant on-ground presence. The virus did not spare elected representatives: Over 100 sitting MLAs, MLCs and MPs, including senior ministers and opposition leaders, were reported to have tested positive for Covid-19. Union minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi, Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Gasti, Congress MLA from Bidar B Narayan Rao and some former MLAs succumbed to the infection. Amid the pandemic, the state witnessed two major bypolls â Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira â followed by gram panchayat elections. It was a mixed year for BJP and not such a good one for Congress and JD(S) as they fared poorly at the hustings. "
"Kozhikode: Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi â who is on a three- day visit in his constituency â said that the current central government has a tendency to use national agencies as political weapons. He was responding to the questioning of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah by the enforcement directorate on Monday after attending a Covid review meeting in Wayanad on Tuesday. âIf somebody is not doing what they (Centre) want politically, they think that they can use CBI and ED to pressurize and threaten them. Not only Farooq Abdullah, many other leaders and I myself am personally facing these assaults; I have a number of cases against my name. These institutions are designed to bring justice to the people of India. They are not personal instruments of the prime minister,â he said. Kamal Nathâs remarks unfortunate Rahul also disapproved the âitemâ remark made by MP Congress chief Kamal Nath against minister Imarti Devi and termed it âunfortunateâ. âOne cannot treat women with disrespect. Kamal Nath ji is from my party. But, I personally donât like the type of language that he used. I do not appreciate this type of language regardless of who uses it. It is unfortunate,â Rahul said. Continuing his attack on the NDA government over the standoff with China along LAC in eastern Ladakh, Rahul said PM Narendra Modi should tell the nation when the Chinese troops will be thrown out of the Indian territory. âBut the Prime Minister wonât have the guts to say that. The PM will not say one word about China,â he said when asked about the 6pm address by the PM. âIt is shocking to me. There is no country in the world today when a foreign power can take 1,200 sq km of the country and there is no answer from the leadership,â Rahul said. Responding to a question on the gold smuggling case, he said, âAlready NIA and others are investigating the issue. Letâs see where the investigation goes.â "
"BENGALURU: N R Santosh, the political secretary to chief minister BS Yediyurappa, is said to have attempted suicide at his Dollars Colony residence in Bengaluru on Friday. Santosh was found unconscious by his family members in the evening in his reading room. He was rushed to MS Ramaiah hospital nearby. While police said he was critical, the hospital did not respond to queries. According to police sources, Santosh is suspected to have consumed sleeping pills, the quantity of which is not known. The CM visited Santosh in the hospital later in the night. ""I had met him in the morning. We went out for a walk. I have no idea why he did this. I hope he recovers,"" Yediyurappa told journalists near the hospital. A relative of Yediyurappa, Santosh's political fortunes were going through a stormy phase as questions were being raised about his clout with the CM and his family. He was appointed political secretary to the CM in May this year. He had played a key role in ensuring the fall of the JD(S)-Congress government last year. "
"HYDERABAD: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) OBC Morcha national president K Laxman on Friday alleged that TRS and AIMIM have destroyed Hyderabad city.  ""While BJP in Hyderabad is trying to bring into limelight the local issues that the people of Hyderabad are facing, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is trying to bring national issues into the GHMC election campaign. While we question the TRS about the promises that were made by them earlier and their failure in keeping up to the promises in solving the problems people are facing, they are diverting the local issues by bringing national topics,"" Laxman told ANI.  ""TRS and AIMIM have destroyed the heritage of Hyderabad in terms of religion and caste,"" he added.  The BJP leader asked what problem does the TRS party have when BJP national leaders are coming to Hyderabad for GHMC election campaigning?  ""They (BJP leaders) are the leaders of this nation and if they are coming for the election campaign, what problem do TRS have with that. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao isn't even coming out into public. You can call in Dawood Ibrahim for your campaign, as we all are well aware of the relationship you share with AIMIM.""  Responding to AIMIM's controversial statements on P.V.Narasimha Rao and NTR Ghat, he said, ""Akbaruddin Owaisi must be ashamed of his statements on PV Narasimha Rao and Nandamuri Tarakarama Rao. PV Narasimha Rao had served this nation as Prime Minister and has worked for the betterment of people. He is the son of this Telangana. Nandamuri Tarakarama Rao too has served the people of Hyderabad and people are well aware of his work. I do not understand what these two parties AIMIM and TRS are willing to do to this state.""  Reportedly, during the GHMC election campaign, AIMIM Assembly floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi termed the memorials of PV Narasimha Rao (Gnan Bhoomi) and NT Rama Rao (NTR Ghat) constructed along the Necklace Road abutting Hussain Sagar as encroachments and demanded their removal.

"JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday accused the BJP of trying to destabilise his government by resorting to ""negative politics"" by speculating on its fall and stoking fears about coronavirus pandemic. Asserting that the BJP leaders' speculations on behalf of their central leadership reveal their anti-democratic moorings, the chief minister expressed faith in the people of Rajasthan, saying they would accept no ""unethical"" practices and reply to the BJP's efforts to take political mileage. ""Blinded by the greed for power, the state BJP leaders are doing negative politics by giving statements at the behest of their Central leaders about toppling the government and spreading fear about coronavirus,"" said Gehlot in a statement. ""The BJP should know that people of Rajasthan will not accept such unethical acts and will reply to BJP''s measly efforts to take political mileage,"" he added. Accusing the BJP leaders of indulging in ""negative politics"", Gehlot said, ""In this era of a global pandemic, when the Rajasthan government is working along with the opposition and all sections of the society, the BJP leaders' statements are bringing down the level of politics in the state."" In his statement, Gehlot said the BJP leaders have made ""unrestrained"" remarks in the past few days about the corona management of the Rajasthan government and the future of the government. ""Their negative politics has created resentment in the public against the opposition,"" he said. ""Many senior leaders of Rajasthan's BJP have given statements that the state government will fall in coming days,"" he said, naming Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria and Union Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal among others as having made such statements. ""It is clear from these statements that the BJP is trying to destabilise the Rajasthan government on the basis of money and muscle power,"" he said The BJP made similar efforts in the past, but due to the solidarity and commitment of the Congress MLAs, they had to face defeat, Gehlot added. The BJP, which formed the government through horse-trading in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, is still frustrated by its defeat in Rajasthan, the statement said. "
"MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies will fight all elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal corporation (BMC) poll, together. Thackeray (60), who is heading the Shiv Sena-NCP- Congress alliance ministry, was speaking to select media at his official residence Varsha in south Mumbai, as the MVA regime completes a year in office on Saturday. ""The MVA will fight all elections including the BMC poll (due in 2022) together,"" Thackeray said, adding that he did not feel the need to react to speculation that the MVA partners will fight the polls separately. Asserting that his government is stable, Thackeray said the alliance partners are perceived to be ideologically different but the interests of the state and welfare of people binds the three parties together. ""We were in an ideological alliance earlier but the very foundation of that ideology, (based on) trust and faith, was betrayed,"" Thackeray said, alluding to the power his Shiv Sena party shared in the state with the BJP during 1995-1999 and again during 2014-19. Thackeray defended his party's alliance with political rivals Congress and NCP to form government, saying Shiv Sena was in alliance with a partner (BJP) which had a dark mind. ""You will now realise what we went through when we were in alliance with BJP. The pervert mind is now exposed,"" he said, referring to BJP targeting his wife Rashmi in land deals and son Aaditya in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Thackeray said the most unforgettable moment last year was the ""betrayal by a friend"" of 25 to 30 years. ""Perversion and being cultured are different. Pervert politics is being seen now,"" he said, slamming the BJP. Shiv Sena had criticised BJP on policy matters and did not target family members, he said. On Hindutva, Thackeray said, ""My definition of Hindutva hasn't changed. It is cultured and not pervert like the BJP. Culture is very important in Hindutva."" ""When we are with you (BJP), we are good. The land deals happened when you were in government,"" Thackeray said, referring to BJP's claim that Rashmi Thackeray had land deals with Anvay Naik, the architect who committed suicide in 2018. He said BJP leaders targeting him are all outsiders and do not belong to the 'original' BJP. ""Is the BJP being run by outsiders now,"" he asked. Asked about his national ambitions, Thackeray said the three-party alliance in Maharashtra against the BJP did send a message at national level. ""I will keep walking. I took up this responsibility (chief minister's post) out of anger over BJP's betrayal. There is no point in keeping undue expectations. Let us see what happens,"" he said. ""He can keep dreaming. To dream is not a crime,"" Thackeray said when asked about the claim by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that he would return to power. Thackeray also rubbished reports that the Sharad Pawar-led NCP may go with the BJP. ""I am confident that NCP will stay in the MVA,"" he added. He also made light of criticism that the MVA regime was ""remote-controlled"" by Pawar. ""Whenever he (Pawar) meets me, he shares his experiences and nothing else,"" Thackeray said. ""I don't sit with a slate and chalk when he comes to me,"" he added. Thackeray said tackling the coronavirus pandemic in the early days of his tenure was a daunting and challenging task. ""Though I lacked administrative skills, my political allies and bureaucracy worked in unison with me. We are the first state to have a task force and guidelines for Covid-19 treatment. Field hospitals in Mumbai were created in 17 days,"" he said. Despite the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Maharashtra signed several MoUs for investment in the state, Thackeray said. ""Around 60 to 70 per cent of MoUs worth Rs 17000 crore were signed in June and are on path of implementation in terms of granting of permissions and land acquisition for the projects. MoUs worth Rs 35000 crore more were also signed recently,"" he said. "
"CHENNAI: In the climax of his 2002 flop âBabaâ, Rajinikanth makes a last-minute return from sanyaas to socio-political life. On Tuesday, the actor made a virtual repeat of the theme, this time in reverse, going back on his promise to launch a political party. âI regret to announce that I am not in position to launch a party and enter politics. Only I know the pain behind this announcement. This will come as a disappointment to those part of RMM (Rajini Makkal Mandram), my fans and people. Forgive me,â Rajinikanth said in a three-page statement. âSome people may ridicule me. But fearing them, I cannot sacrifice those who trust and travel with me,â he said. Rajinikanth, who was shooting in Hyderabad for his latest movie last week, was hospitalised for three days with complaints of fluctuating blood pressure after four of the crew members tested positive for Covid-19. He tested negative for the virus. Rajinikanthâs announcement on Tuesday came as a shock for some, disappointment for some others, who were anticipating the actorâs promised December 31 announcement. Fans took to social media to express, yet many wished him good health. Some of them regrouped in front of his Poes Garden residence to make a last ditch attempt to make Rajini reconsider his decision. âVaanga Thalaiva, Naanga Irukkomâ (Come out, leader, we are here), one of the fans tweeted. âYou do not worry. We will take care of the hard work,â said another. RSS ideologue and Tuglak editor S Gurumurthy termed Rajinikanth's decision as âinevitableâ. He hoped Rajinikanth would still make an impact in the coming elections as he did in the 1996 assembly polls (when the actor had issued a statement against Jayalalithaa), which the DMK-TMC alliance won with a big majority. In his statement, Rajinikanth said despite the advice from doctors not to venture out, he had travelled to Hyderabad to shoot for a film. All the 120 people who participated in the shooting were made to follow strict Covid protocols and undergo tests every day, he said. âStill four people tested positive for Covid and the director halted the shooting to carry out Covid tests for all. The result was negative for me. But due to severe fluctuations in my blood pressure, I was admitted to a hospital and was monitored for three days. Fluctuating blood pressure is harmful for my transplanted kidney. I considered it as a warning from God. If despite strict protocols, four out of 120 could test positive, what could happen when thousands and even lakhs assemble for my campaign,â Rajinikanth said. The actor said he cannot trigger his desired uprising by campaigning merely through social media and videos. âIf I venture out, it could become a big risk for all, especially when a second wave of the virus is spreading. If a well-organised film shoot can result in my hospitalization for three days, participating in an election campaign could become even more risky and I do not want to leave people in the lurch midway,â he said. RMM functionaries have toiled hard over the past three years and served the people during Covid. Their efforts will not go waste. RMM will continue to function as usual. âI will continue to serve the people away from electoral politics. I never hesitated in expressing my honest opinion,â the actor said, thanking his RMM secretaries for abiding by his decisions. "
"JALANDHAR: âNauhn-maas da rishtaâ (bond between nail and flesh) is how alliance between The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was described by the leaders of both the political outfits. However, the relationship ended abruptly in 2020 and became biggest political development in the state in recent years. Before the heat of farmersâ agitation reached Delhi and hit national headlines, SAD-BJP alliance was its first big casualty. SAD, the second oldest party in the country, and the biggest party of the country â BJP â appear to be grappling with major crisis in Punjab on their own now. SAD is nowhere in the scene in the agitation, even as Sikhs farmers â once its core constituency â are the face and biggest strength of this movement. BJP appears marginalised, though till a few months back its moves and choices were being watched very keenly â whether it would continue with Badals or would prefer Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa. Badals first gave unflinching support to the three farm ordinances and spoke in the same language being used by BJP top brass. Even five-time former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, known to have his fingers on publicâs nerve, unequivocally supported the bills and called the opposition to these âmisguided and misplacedâ. This just a few days before SAD cut ties with NDA and Badal returned his Padma Vibhushan. The gesture apparently did not move protesters though it did make headlines. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal â who would once call the alliance the guarantee of the communal harmony in the state â called BJP the âreal tukde tukde gangâ. In Punjab, the political fluidity was already there, especially in the opposition space, and NDA break up added to it. SAD has not reaped any clear benefit from the decision so far, except stop attrition in its rank. As of now, no party appears to be gaining out of the farmersâ movement. AAP which was biggest gainer of frustration among people in 2014 is now just a spectator. The magnitude of the movement has also added to the political fluidity in the state as none of the parties has been allowed to address the crowds. "
"VADODARA: Imran Gudala aka Imu Dand, the prime accused in the contract killing of Jhalod municipality councillor Hiren Patel, too harboured political ambition that closely depended on the influential Katara family in the town. Gudala was also the key person who ensured that the family wrested the Jhalod municipality. Gudala has only one case of black marketing registered against him about a decade back. He managed to win the Jhalod market yard polls in 2012 and around the same time became close to the Katara family that includes former MP Babu Katara, his son and MLA Bhavesh Katara as well as Amit Katara whose wife was appointed as the president of the Jhalod municipality. She was, however, ousted after defections in which Patel had played an active role. Gudala had become an influential person in Dahod due to his proximity with the Katara family. Sources said that he had played a key role in ensuring that Amitâs wife became the president of the municipality after the 2018 municipal polls that threw a fractured mandate. According to the police, Gudala had ensured that Patel was killed at the behest of Amit. The police claims that Gudala disclosed this during his interrogation after being nabbed by the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATTS) of the state police. Assistant superintendent of police Shefali Barwal said that Gudala was brought to Dahod after obtaining his custody from ATS. She added that a remand would now be sought for his interrogation. Patel died after being run over by a mini commercial vehicle in September. The accused had tried to cover the murder as a road accident, but CCTV footage had led the police to the murder. It had come to light that the murder was a contract killing. An accused in the Godhra Sabarmati Express carnage case Irfan Pada had taken up the job to eliminate Gudala. "
"CHENNAI: Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM) functionaries are in a state of grief, unable to digest their leaderâs decision not to launch a political party. Many said they were âpolitically orphanedâ, but added they valued Rajiniâs health more than anything else. Namakkal district secretary R Arangannal and Salem district secretary A Senthil Kumar said the RMM office bearers had an informal interaction, after Rajiniâs statement was released, and decided to wait for instruction from their leader to decide what to do next. Arangannal was hopeful that Rajini would interact with the RMM secretaries and give specific instructions as to what to do and whom to support. Till the announcement from Rajini, the RMM functionaries were hopeful of fighting it out at the hustings, they said. The three-page statement came as a bolt from the blue for many, who had been nurturing political hopes ever since Rajini made his maiden political comment way back in 1996. âFollowing Thalaivarâs (leader) instructions, we formed polling-booth-level committees in almost 70% of the polling stations across the state. He was always in two minds. He had enough time to launch the party in the last two years after he made the announcement in December 2017. There was no Covid then, but he kept biding time. It is a big disappointment. He has left us politically orphaned,â said an RMM district secretary, preferring anonymity. A few functionaries, who joined the mandram in the last two years, are exploring their own political options. âThalaivar has put no restriction on us in taking our own political decisions. New entrants in the party may look for alternatives. But true fans of Rajinikanth will not join any other party. They will wait,â said Pepsi G Vekatesan, Dharmapuri district secretary of RMM. He said his team had formed 1,400 booth-level committees in the district. "
"NEW DELHI: If all governments and parties leave politics aside and join hands, pollution can be controlled within a year. This was stated by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday, adding that technological solutions were available to turn stubble into cardboard and other products, making it an asset rather than a liability, but political will was needed for that. Reacting to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekarâs comment on pollution, Kejriwal said, âI do not agree with his statement that air pollution cannot be solved in a day and will take a minimum of four years. I believe that if all state governments come together and all political parties work honestly by keeping aside their political differences, we can address the issue in less than four years.â Track the pollution level in your cityKejriwal said there was a lack of political will to embrace new technologies to stop stubble burning. âScientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute developed a solution that decomposes stubble into manure. Secondly, a factory at Karnal is converting stubble into compressed biogas. This gas can be used like CNG. Why canât we adopt such technology? This factory buys stubble from farmers. In this way, farmers get money and their income increases. Eventually, Indraprastha Gas Limited buys this gas,â he added. âIn Punjab, there are around seven factories making coal and coke from stubble. People from these factories go to the fields of farmers, cut the stubble and pay farmers Rs 500 for each acre. The companies then sell the coal to NTPC,â said Kejriwal. The CM said that coal, coke, CNG and cardboard could be produced from stubble. âIf the state governments start utilising these new technologies, farmers can increase their income by selling stubble. This can also put an end to farm fires. These factories are employing many people. If all state governments come together and start working on a war footing, I believe that we can control stubble burning within a year. We consider stubble as a liability, but we need to convert it into an opportunity. The only question is whether we are ready to show our political will or whether we continue to do politics over the issue,â Kejriwal added. Requesting Javadekar to hold meetings with chief ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP every month, Kejriwal said, âStrict deadlines and timelines should be made to combat the issues of stubble burning and air pollution.â "
"NEW DELHI: Over 100 former bureaucrats have written a letter to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, saying the anti-conversion ordinance had transformed the state into an âepicentre of politics of hate, division and bigotryâ and demanded its immediate withdrawal. The open letter with 104 signatories, including former national security adviser Shivshankar Menon, former foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and former adviser to the PM TKA Nair, said, â...UP, once... the cradle of the Ganga-Jamuna civilisation, has become the epicentre of politics of hate, division and bigotry, and institutions of governance are now steeped in communal poison.â The letter cited instances of minorities being allegedly targeted, including the case from Moradabad in which two men were allegedly dragged by Bajrang Dal activists to police who arrested them on allegations that one of them had forced a Hindu girl to marry him. âWhat is inexcusable is the police remained mute as vigilantes harassed and interrogated the innocent couple. (The woman) suffered a miscarriage, possibly as a result of harassment,â the letter said, quoting a newspaper report. It said the anti-conversion ordinance is âbeing used as a stick to victimise especially those Indian men who are Muslims and women who dare to exercise their freedom of choiceâ. While the various high courts, including the Allahabad HC, have ruled unequivocally that choosing oneâs life partner is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution, UP is blithely undermining that very Constitution,â the letter said.

"NEW DELHI: Actor Rajinikanth had declared on December 10 that he would make the name of his political party public in January. However, just a day after getting discharged from a hospital in Hyderabad, Rajinikanth announced on Tuesday that he would not launch a political party. Rajinikanth has shown indecisiveness by going back on his words within three weeks. This is not just the first time that the actor has displayed ambivalence or done volte face over taking a serious political plunge. Founding political partyIt was for the first time on December 31, 2017 that he announced that he would launch a political party. He also said his party would contest all the 234 assembly seats in Tamil Nadu. The next year, he said he would try to do spiritual politics and elaborated that it meant corruption-free and honest politics. He repeated his commitment for spiritual politics on December 10 while announcing his plan to launch a political party in January 2021 in order to contest the forthcoming Tamil Nadu assembly elections next year. However, in just 19 days, Rajinikanth gave up his plan to form a political party. He cited his health condition as the reason for his decision and tendered an apology to his fans and members of the Rajini Makkal Mandram (RMM). He was to make an announcement on December 31 about his political course. In a three-page statement, Rajinikanth said, âWith regrets, I am saying that I am not able to start the political party,â he said adding that only he can understand the âpain he enduredâ to take such a decision and make the announcement. The actor said opting to use only the social media and videos cannot bring in the uprising among people that he desired. âIf I venture out, it could become a big risk for all, especially when a second variant of the virus is spreading. People will say several things about me and I will take it in my stride. If a well-organized film shoot can result in my hospitalization for three days, extensive campaign could become even more risky and I do not want to create problems for everyone who joins me,â Rajinikanth said. Name of political partyOn December 10, Rajinikanth floated RMM, which translated to English means Rajini People's Forum. RMM was believed to be the initial avatar of his political party. Rajinikanthâs party was originally registered as Anaithindhia Makkal Shakthi Kazhagam (AMSK). However, it was subsequently changed to Makkal Sevai Katchi (MSK) through an amended notification of the Election Commission. There were speculations that he may contest election in the name of an already registered but non-recognised party. However, now even all speculations have fallen flat. Election symbolAccording to reports, the Makkal Sevai Katchi had submitted an application to the Election Commission seeking a common poll symbol for its candidates. The application reportedly listed a two-finger pose as MSKâs first choice and an auto-rickshaw as its second choice. Rajinikanth had made the two-finger pose famous in his film Baba released in 2002. The auto-rickshaw is associated with him in his 1995 blockbuster Baashha. The actor seemed in two minds also regarding RMMâs logo. Initially it was lotus. However, since it was the BJPâs election symbol, the logo was changed to the cobra snake within two months. Shortly thereafter, even the cobra snake logo was dropped. "
"BOLPUR: Iterating that the BJP is a ""party of outsiders"", West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday asserted that the land of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore would never allow hate politics to triumph over secularism. Banerjee, during a rally in Bolpur, claimed that conspiracies were being hatched to destroy the state's inclusive culture and cautioned people against divisive politics. ""Stop this politics of violence... this divisive politics. Please steer clear of outsiders in your area, inform the local police if necessary. If some goons from outside come to our state to terrorise locals, all of you should put up a united fight against them,"" she said. Branding Visva-Bharati Vice Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty as a ""BJP man"", the CM claimed that he is planning to destroy the rich heritage of the hallowed institution by ""importing divisive and communal politics inside its campus"". ""Those who do not respect Mahatma Gandhi and other icons of the country are now talking of building 'Sonar Bangla' (Golden Bengal). ""Rabindranath Tagore has created 'Sonar Bangla' several decades ago, all we need to do is to protect the place from the communal onslaught of the BJP,"" Banerjee said during her address, following a four-kilometre roadshow here. The feisty TMC boss said that ""attempts to destroy Tagore's cultural abode (Visva-Bharati) have to be resisted"". ""I feel bad when I see efforts are on to pursue communal politics at Visva-Bharati. The VC there is a BJP man, he is trying to tarnish this institution's heritage by practising communal politics,"" the chief minister claimed. Chakraborty recently drew the ire of the state government after reports in the media claimed that he has accused Nobel laureate Amartya Sen of occupying varsity land illegally. Talking about the recent defections from the TMC, Banerjee said saffron camp might have ""bought a few MLAs"", but it can never buy her party. Senior TMC leader Suvendu Adhikari, along with five party MLAs and another MP, joined the BJP on December 19, during Union Home Minister Amit Shah's rally at Medinipur. Describing Shah's recent visit to a folk singer's residence here for lunch on December 20 as nothing short of ""show off"", Banerjee claimed that the food items served to the BJP leader were cooked at five-star hotels. Reacting to Banerjee's comments, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the TMC supremo is wary of the saffron party's rise in Bengal. ""What makes her think that only the TMC has the right to talk about Rabindranath Tagore? The TMC government has failed miserably on all fronts in the last ten years, and now she is trying to brand us as outsiders. ""The days of the TMC dispensation are numbered in Bengal, and I think she has sensed it. The TMC is wary of the BJP's rise in Bengal,"" he said. Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are due in April-May. "

"HYDERABAD: Covid-19 has in a way helped political parties come to grips with the reality of maintaining social distancing with even the rank and file at the village level also getting updated and trained on virtual meetings. More than 3,000 virtual meetings and brainstorming sessions have been held since April by all the political parties, it is learnt. Leading the race is Telangana Congress, which has conducted more than 2,000 meetings through various applications. All the important PCC meetings and activities at the state level are being conducted on virtual platforms now. âWe are soon going to launch training sessions on various issues on the virtual platform. From each district, a few leaders will be selected. By this month-end, about 3,000 leaders will be selected and they, in turn, will use their social media handles to convey our party stand on various issues,â Deepak John, chairman, social media wing of Telangana Congress, told TOI. All the district and mandal-level leaders now have their own social media handles. Sources said Telangana Congress has a virtual platform account for 1,000 people who can participate in a meeting in one go. The recent meeting of PV Narasimha Rao birth centenary fete here saw several national leaders like Manmohan Singh, P Chidambaram and others addressing the party workers through virtual mode. While Congress has stolen a march over others in organising virtual meetings, BJP is not far behind. Except for one meeting of the newly-formed state executive committee, all the party meetings and workshops at the local level are happening through social media platforms. âWe have used the virtual platforms to gather our rank and file to distribute food and other necessities to migrant labourers,â Venkata Ramana, Telangana BJP IT cell in-charge, told TOI. BJP had also conducted more than 200 virtual meetings. The party conducts virtual rallies and national-level leaders have been addressing state-level meetings. The TRS, however, does not seem to be very keen on having increased virtual meetings and activities. âWe are in the government. Our work should be made known to people in a proper manner. We donât really focus on virtual platforms,â said a top TRS leader. "
"Pune: Shantanu Nitin Dange (34), former city unit president of Akhil Bharatiya Sena â a political party floated by Mumbai don Arun Gawli â was arrested last week on the charge of illegally possessing a country-made revolver. Dange, lodged in the Kolhapur jail in a case of jewellery robbery at Khambatki ghat in Khandala in 2017, was released on temporary bail in June this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Assistant inspector Sandip Jamdade from crime branch (Unit IV) said on Monday, âDuring our ongoing drive to check undertrials and convicts released from jails on temporary bail or parole, our team member Ramesh Rathod received a tip-off that Dange, who runs a vehicle repair garage, had concealed a firearm at the facility in Dhayari. We searched the garage on December 22 and recovered the revolver. Dange was taken into custody after he failed to offer an apt explanation.â Jamdade further said, âDange initially told the police that one of his customers had forgotten the firearm at his garage. When asked why he did not inform the police about it, he claimed that he was waiting for the customer to come back and collect his firearm. But he could not share details like the name, address and the cellphone number of the customer, and the latterâs vehicle details.â He said, âDange admitted during the questioning that he had received the revolver from a known person for selling it. We have registered an FIR against him under the relevant sections of the Arms Act and transferred his custody to the Sinhagad police for taking action.â The Khandala police had arrested five persons, including Dange, for intercepting the car of a jeweller and robbing 9kg gold ornaments at Khambatki ghat in 2017. Four suspects were earlier released on bail after the chargesheet was filed. Dange was the last suspect to be released on bail. Gawli, who in the 198os had links to a dominant political party in Mumbai, later fell out with that partyâs chief and floated his own outfit, Akhil Bharatiya Sena, in 1997. Gawli is currently serving a life sentence afer he was convicted in 2012 for the murder of a politician. "
"KOLHAPUR: Political workers and supporters declaring their own candidature for the upcoming Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC)  has become a cause for worry for the leaders. Some aspirants have already put up hoardings in their wards and have started campaigning on social media. Some have even started meeting voters. All of them have one thing in common â they all claim that they will be getting the official nomination from the political parties. Satej Patil, the Kolhapur district guardian minister and senior Congress functionary, said: âThe political workers should show some restrain. They should not waste their energy fighting each other for tickets. The party will declare the official nominees, who must get support from all the workers.â Some former corporators and local satraps have declared that if they did not get the nomination, then they would contest the election as independent candidates. While, the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena are going to contest separately, the BJP and Tararani Aghadi are going to team up for the polls and may face rebellion if the party workers are denied tickets. A senior Tararani Aghadi functionary, on the condition of anonymity, said, âIt will be a tough task to select candidates. We had faced some rebellion last time. This time, we will ensure that tickets are given only to those with elective merit.â Shiv Sena divided Due to factions and differences among local leaders, the Shiv Sena is likely to face a tough election. The Sena in the city is divided between two camps â one of city president Sanjay Pawar and the other of former city MLA Rajesh Kshirsagar. On Sunday, minister Uday Samant tried to patch up things between the leaders. "
"NEW DELHI: As India stays out of the ongoing political crisis in Nepal, instead looking to focus on its economic ties, Kathmandu has said that the Nepal government will not allow the current instability to come in the way of bilateral cooperation with India. Speaking for the first time since the K P Sharma Oli government dissolved the lower house of Parliament last week â plunging the country into political turmoilâ Nepal's ambassador to India Nilambar Acharya told TOI the Oli government is looking to hold the foreign minister-level Joint Commission meeting that will see Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali visiting India. ""Preparations are on for the Joint Commission meeting and the visit by the foreign minister. The lower house of the Parliament has been dissolved but the government and other institutions are still working,"" said Acharya, adding that bilateral ties with India had improved significantly in the past few months after the tensions over the Kalapani dispute. ""With the visit by the Indian Army chief and then the foreign secretary, there has been a turnaround in the relationship and this trend is going to hold,"" said Acharya. Nepal's reciprocation of the willingness expressed by India to build upon the recent improvement in ties is significant at a time when India refuses to turn itself into a factor in Nepal's domestic politics even as China makes a blatant and frenzied effort to keep Oli and his rival P K Dahal Prachanda together. While steering clear of the political shenanigans in Kathmandu, India has sought to keep building bilateral engagements upon the discussions during foreign secretary Harsh Shringla's visit last month. The visit was followed by 2 back-to-back virtual meetings between the commerce and energy secretaries. The Oli government had responded positively to Shringla's suggestion of resuming people-to-people contacts and for commencement of an air travel bubble between the 2 countries. Indian ambassador V M Kwatra Monday met Nepal's new energy minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi and discussed bilateral energy and power cooperation, including implementation of joint projects. Despite his pro-China image, and the decision earlier to release a new political map of Nepal, Oli had worked in the past few months to improve ties with India and also allay concerns that his government was acting in China's interest. Sources in Kathmandu continue to insist that Nepal would never have issued a new map if India had agreed earlier to address the Kalapani issue through dialogue. While India, unlike China, is not wedded to the idea of unity in the ruling NCP, the government also knows that any intervention in the Nepal crisis is unlikely to go down well not just with the political establishment in Kathmandu but also the common man. China, which rushed a delegation to help resolve differences between Oli and Dahal, is faced with allegations of interference in Nepal's internal affairs. The Chinese delegation leader, Guo Yezhou, had met President B D Bhandari and Oli Sunday. On Monday, he met Dahal, apparently to convince him to drop his opposition to Oli, and M K Nepal who replaced Oli as co-chair of the party. Guo was also said to have discussed with Oli if it might be possible for him to roll back his decision to dissolve the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court will decide on the merit of the decision next month. China Monday also urged all sides in Nepal to bear in mind the nationâs interest, the overall picture and ""properly handle internal disputes"" and strive to achieve political stability and national development. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that the CPC will work together with all political parties in Nepal to promote China and Nepalâs strategic cooperation partnership and promote benefits to people of the 2 countries.

"MUMBAI: Launching a veiled attack on the BJP-led central government after the Enforcement Directorate summoned his wife, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday said central agencies were being used as ""weapons"" against family members of those political opponents who cannot be won over. Raut told reporters that the ED action reflected ""frustration"" of the BJP against him, as he was instrumental in the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government last year and didn't yield to the pressure to make it unstable. Shiv sena will respond in the equal measure, he said. ""I have been doing regular correspondence with the enforcement directorate (ED)for the last one-and-a-half months regarding a Rs 50 lakh loan taken by my wife ten years ago from a friend to purchase a house,"" the Rajya Sabha MP said. He said all the details regarding this loan had already been submitted to the ED during the correspondence. The ED summoned Varsha Raut for questioning in the PMC Bank money laundering case on December 29, officials had said on Sunday. The officials had said that Varsha Raut has been asked to appear before the federal agency in Mumbai. This is the third summon issued to her after she skipped the earlier two on health grounds, they said. ""When the ED itself did not mention that the correspondence was regarding the PMC Bank scam case and HDIL, then how can BJP leaders say so?"" he asked. Raut, the chief spokesperson of the Uddhav Thackeray- led party, said his wife is a teacher. ""We are middle-class people. My wife had taken a loan from a friend 10 years ago to purchase a house. Details have been given to the Income Tax (department) and also mentioned in my Raya Sabhaaffidavit. The ED woke up to this deal after ten years,"" he wondered. Raut also suggested that some BJP leaders speaking against him since December 27 used to frequent the ED office (in south Mumbai) and ""have taken away some papers from the office"". He declined to give any names. ""When you can't finish off your opponents politically, weapons such as the ED or CBI are being uses blatantly against their family members,"" Raut said. The MP said he discussed the issue with the Sena president and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. ""The ED is issuing summons. The BJP is targeting me in its frustration. The Shiv Sena will respond in the equal measure,"" he said. Raut said the BJP had been pressurising him since the last one year ""to not allow the MVA government to survive"". The Maha Vikas Aghadi government consists of the Sena, the NCP and Congress. ""I was told that 22 MLAs of the Congress and the NCP are on the radar of central agencies who will be taken in and forced to resign. Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik (who is under the ED scanner in connection with a money laundering case registered against a firm) is just one such example. ""When nothing envisaged by the BJP happened till November, which was deadline set by the BJP for itself to topple the state government, children and wives of those who were associated with the formation of the MVA government are being targeted,"" he claimed. He said there was no threat to the state government. ""You send a notice or arrest us, the government will remain stable,"" he added. Earlier in the day, Raut told reporters that he had not received any notice from the ED. ""I am searching for that notice since Sunday. BJP leaders are speaking about it. I have sent my person to the office of the BJP to look for the ED notice. I feel it might got stuck there (in the BJP's office). All this is politics,"" he said. "
"MUMBAI: Yuva Sena president and Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday termed ""politically motivated"" the summons issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to wife of Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. The ED summoned Varsha Raut for questioning in the PMC Bank money laundering case on December 29, officials had said on Sunday. ""The ED move is politically motivated. We are not scared. The MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government is stable,"" Aaditya, son of Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, told reporters when asked about the ED summons. The ED officials had said that Varsha Raut has been asked to appear before the federal agency in Mumbai. This is the third summons issued to her after she skipped the earlier two on health grounds, they said. The summons for questioning has been issued to her under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The ED wants to question Varsha Raut with regard to ""receipt"" of some funds that were allegedly siphoned from the bank, official sources had claimed. The ED had filed a PMLA case to probe the alleged loan fraud in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank in October last year against the Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), its promoters Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan and his son Sarang Wadhawan, its former chairman Waryam Singh and ex-managing director Joy Thomas.

"KATHMANDU: A high-level Chinese delegation led by a vice minister of the Communist Party of China on Sunday called on Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari ahead of meeting other top leaders to patch up differences between the two warring factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, a week after the surprise dissolution of Parliament and subsequent political turmoil. Vice Minister of the International Department of the CPC Guo Yezhou, who arrived here on Sunday morning in what is believed to be China's desperate attempt to avert a vertical split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP), met President Bhandari at the Rastrapati Bhawan. They discussed matters relating to further strengthening centuries-old bilateral relations, said an official at the President's office. Guo, who personally knows all senior NCP leaders, is scheduled to meet Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Monday, according to sources. He will also hold meetings with senior political leaders including NCP's executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal âPrachandaâ, senior leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction of the party, and chairman of Janata Samajwadi Party Baburam Bhattarai, according to sources. The Chinese embassy here and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are tight-lipped about Guo's visit. His visit is aimed at âtaking stock of Nepal's evolving political situation after the dissolution of the House of Representatives and subsequent split in the ruling NCP amid already-deepened intra-party rift"", My Republica newspaper reported. China is not happy with the split in the largest communist party of Nepal, according to sources. Guo will make efforts to patch up differences between the two warring factions of the ruling party - one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda - during his four day stay in Nepal, according to the Kathmandu Post. Earlier, Gou travelled to Kathmandu in February 2018 when Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) - were all set to merge and form a unified communist party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections. Later in May, 2018, the two communist parties merged and formed a new party named Nepal Communist Party, the paper said. Guo will assess the situation inside the ruling party and will encourage both factions of the NCP to seek some kind of common ground for party unity, the Post said, quoting party leaders. He will communicate the message of Chinese leadership, including that of President Xi Jinping's, to the NCP leadership, a ruling party leader said. âBesides this, the Chinese side has not communicated to us anything about the visit,â the leader told the Post on condition of anonymity. ""China has carefully chosen and sent Gou at a time when unity inside our party is shaken,"" a Standing Committee member of the NCP said. Guo was received by Chinese ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqui at Tribhuvan International Airport. No one from Nepali side was present to welcome the Chinese delegation that came in a scheduled flight from Beijing, The Kathmandu Post quoted sources at the airport as saying. âWe could not even recognise them because they were wearing personal protective equipment,â the source told the paper. Nepal plunged into a political crisis last Sunday after Prime Minister Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. Acting on the prime minister's recommendation, President Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Oli-led Cabinet on Friday recommended the President to convene the winter session of the National Assembly. This is not the first time that China has intervened in Nepal's internal affairs. In May and July, Hou held separate meetings with the president, the prime minister and other senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, when Oli was facing mounting pressure to step down. A number of political party leaders had termed the Chinese envoy's series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepal's internal political affairs. China's political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in the recent years with billions of dollars of investments under its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. Besides the investments, China's ambassador to Nepal Hou has made open efforts to garner support for Oli. The CPC and NCP were regularly engaged in training programmes. In September last year, the NCP had even organised a symposium, inviting some CPC leaders to Kathmandu to impart training to Nepali leaders on the Xi Jinping Thought ahead of the visit of the Chinese president, his first to Nepal, according to a Kathmandu Post report. In a guarded reaction to the fast-paced political developments in Nepal, India on Thursday said it was an ""internal matter"" of the neighbouring nation and it was for the country to decide as per its democratic processes. Meanwhile, President Bhandari has called the winter session of the National Assembly, the upper house of Parliament, from January 1. Assistant spokesperson to the President's office Keshav Prasad Ghimire, in a statement on Sunday, said the President has called for the National Assembly session at 4 PM on January 1. "
"CHENNAI: Sri Lankan cricketer of Tamil origin Muttiah Muralitharan was a terror on the cricket field as he flummoxed international cricketers with his wrist-spinning off-breaks time and again. No wonder he remains the only international cricketer to have scalped 800 wickets in Tests, with his victims mostly bowled or stumped. But an attempt by his close family and friends to make him immemorial on celluloid with a biopic titled '800' has not only forced the leading Test wicket-taker to run for cover, but also landed an acclaimed and popular Tamil actor like Vijay Sethupathi in trouble. It started on October 8, when the production team, comprising Movie Train Motion Pictures and Dar Motion Pictures, officially released the first-look poster that announced the biopic with Sethupathi to depict Muralitharan on screen. The actor too took to Twitter to make it official. Honoured to be a part of this landmark project. Update soon #MuthiahMuralidaran @MovieTrainMP #MuralidaranBiopicâ¦ https://t.co/mgoq7s96pI— VijaySethupathi (@VijaySethuOffl) 1602141678000Earlier, UK-based Tamil singer Teejay, who had featured as one of the two sons of actor Dhanush in award-winning director Vetrimaranâs Tamil hit âAsuranâ, had turned down the offer to play the role of young Muralitharan, saying the script of the film also talks about the Sri Lankan civil war. That was enough for not just the Tamil fringe elements, but also leading film personalities as well as politicians to join the fray to demand that Sethupathi step back from the film. For them, the near-silence of Muralitharan, when the Sri Lankan army set itself upon the Tamils, was a bigger issue than the genocide. They brushed aside a statement from Dar Motion Pictures that it would be a pure sports biopic which wonât hurt the sentiments of Tamils. âIt is difficult to earn a good name with the public. But people have reposed their love in you quite easily. That was because of the roles you donned that reflected the thoughts of people in the last mile. You have a long way to go. Why do you want to give your face for people to remember a betrayer forever? Please somehow try and say no to this project,â director Bharathiraja told Sethupathi. As the war raged on in social media, the actor himself has been maintaining a stoic silence. But he confessed to a friend that he will be in trouble either way â going ahead or withdrawing. Taking to Twitter, lyricist Vairamuthu urged Sethupathi to let go this opportunity for the sake of Tamils.  âSometimes, fame is achieved by not doing something, rather than doing. Your career is on the growth path. Why mar it,â Vairamuthu said. Lyricist Tamara, in an open letter addressed to Sethupathi, wrote: âTake a bold decision. Let us see what happens. The Tamils around the world will be behind us.â Politicians, too, were not far behind. âMuralitharan is a betrayer of the Tamil community. Vijay Sethupathi is loved by the masses due to the roles he played with ease on the screen. He too will be considered a betrayer if he goes ahead and dons Muralitharanâs role in the film,â PMK founder S Ramadoss said in a statement. "
"KATHMANDU: A high-level Chinese delegation led by a vice minister of the Chinese Communist Party arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday to ""take stock"" of Nepal's political situation after the dissolution of Parliament and subsequent split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. Although no specific details about the agenda of the visit are available, the four-member delegation, led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou, will hold high-level talks during its four-day stay in the country, according to highly placed sources. Guo is expected to meet President Bidya Devi Bhandari, Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' and Madhav Kumar Nepal, who has replaced Oli as chairman of the Prachanda-led faction of the party, sources said. The Chinese embassy here and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are tight-lipped about Guo's visit. His visit is aimed at âtaking stock of Nepal's evolving political situation after the dissolution of the House of Representatives and subsequent split in the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) amid already-deepened intra-party rift"", My Republica newspaper reported. China is not happy with the split in the largest communist party of Nepal, according to sources. Guo, who personally knows all senior NCP leaders, will make efforts to patch up differences between the two warring factions of the ruling party - one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda - during his four day stay in Nepal, according to the Kathmandu Post. Earlier, Gou travelled to Kathmandu in February 2018 when Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) - were all set to merge and form a unified communist party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections. Later in May, 2018, the two communist parties merged and formed a new party named Nepal Communist Party, the paper said. Gou will assess the situation inside the ruling party and will encourage both factions of the NCP to seek some kind of common ground for party unity, the Post said, quoting party leaders. He will communicate the message of Chinese leadership, including that of President Xi Jinping's, to the NCP leadership, a ruling party leader said. âBesides this, the Chinese side has not communicated to us anything about the visit,â the leader told the Post on condition of anonymity. China has carefully chosen and sent Gou at a time when unity inside our party is shaken, a Standing Committee member said. Nepal plunged into a political crisis last Sunday after Prime Minister Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. Acting on the prime minister's recommendation, President Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Meanwhile, President Bhandari has called the winter session of the National Assembly, the upper house of Parliament, from January 1, The Kathmandu Post reported. Assistant Spokesperson to the President's office Keshav Prasad Ghimire, in a statement on Sunday, said the President has called for the National Assembly session at 4 PM on January 1. Oli-led Cabinet on Friday recommended the President to convene the winter session of the National Assembly. Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, had communicated about the visit of Guo to Kathmandu during her meetings with senior NCP leaders of both the Prachanda- and Oli-led factions. Beijing appears concerned over the move of Oli to dissolve the House of Representatives and the evolving political situation that saw a vertical split in the NCP. This is not the first time that China has intervened in Nepal's internal affairs. In May and July, Hou held separate meetings with the president, the prime minister and other senior NCP leaders, including Prachanda, when Oli was facing mounting pressure to step down. A number of political party leaders had termed the Chinese envoy's series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepal's internal political affairs.

"For many of us journalists, the biggest thing that happened past week was about something that never happened: Rajinikanth meeting Amit Shah. Two intelligence officers gave three reporters four versions of the meeting â they will meet, wonât meet, may meet, may not meet (the last two can be different for a journalist depending on the tone and the timing of the information). BJP functionaries and Rajini associates werenât different. Some BJP men were âpositiveâ about the rendezvous, some others said it was âunlikelyâ. Someone from the Rajini side said on Friday he was âsureâ about it, but changed the probability to âlikelyâ on Saturday. A few from both sides admitted they were as clueless as we journalists were. The suspense continued well into the wee hours of Sunday as the Union home minister, despite his recent battle with Covid-19, held marathon meetings in his hotel room. Despite a midnight âalertâ â the last in a series through the past two days â that the meeting âwas onâ, this newspaper decided not to report it since our multiple reporters could not confirm the information with multiple, unrelated sources (a gold standard we try to follow in such situations). Finally, Rajini did not meet Amit (psst â¦ or did he?). It would be an important story if the Superstar met the BJPâs prime strategist; it would be an interesting story if we had double confirmation that they were meeting (even if they were to call it off later); but it would be a non-story to say there is speculation over the two meeting. Think of it. There is no need for Rajini and Amit to have a âsecret meetingâ. There is a difference between a closed-door meeting and a secret meeting. A ministerial cabinet meeting, for example, doesnât allow media â or anyone else â but that the meeting is happening is public knowledge. As for politiciansâ âsecret meetingsâ, most of them happen in plain sight to avoid suspicion (they âaccidentallyâ bump into each other at airport lounges when they donât get to greet each other at common friendsâ weddings or funerals). If Rajini and Amit have to have a secret talk, why should they meet at all? Why canât they have a video call (which they might have done several times). And, if at all the two had to meet â in a physical space, that is â it should be either out of courtesy or for optics. If Rajini, a man of manners, decides to meet Amit, it would be for the former reason. If Amit wants it, it would be for the latter. Now that the edge-of-the seat anti-climax is over, sit back and enjoy this imaginary script: (Interior of a hotel suite where Amit opens the door with folded hands) Amit: âVanakkam, Rajinijiâ Rajini:âNamaste, Amitji.â (The two sit on plush chairs, five metres apart. Camera zooms out â and out of the room, still showing, through a glass window, the two men in an animated conversation that is inaudible. Suspenseful music in the background. Cuts between tight close-ups of Rajiniâs hand gestures and Amitâs shifting eyes behind the spectacles. Camera zooms in again, and the two are now audible) Amit: âHereâs what I have to offer. Will you take it, Superstar?â (Rajini stands up, hands on his hips, looks down on the table and smiles) Rajini: âThanks, Amitji, but no thanks.â (Dramatic music as Rajini, in slow motion, walks away and past the camera that now zooms into the table to show a plate of cookies) "
"KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has countered PM Narendra Modiâs charges against the Bengal government, calling them an attempt âto mislead people with half-truths and distorted factsâ. âWe have always been ready to cooperate in farmersâ interest. I myself have written two letters and have even spoken to the minister but they are indulging in malicious propaganda for political gains. The charge of not cooperating for a scheme that benefits farmers is absurd when we are implementing so many schemes along with the Centre. The Centre is violating established practices and norms regarding implementation of central schemes by state governments,â she said. The chief minister had written to the Centre on September 9 and December 21, reminding it that the state was awaiting a decision on âthe transfer of requisite funds for onward disbursement to farmers through the state government machineryâ. âA list of beneficiaries will be sent to you for your information,â she wrote, adding: âThe state government is already implementing a scheme of direct fund transfer to farmers, including share-croppers.â Bengal already had the Krishak Bandhu scheme, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy reminded the Centre after Modiâs speech, and Rs 2,642 crore had been disbursed from the state exchequer to 42 lakh farmers (three of five farmers in the state). Nine lakh more farmers have applied for the scheme this December alone as part of the Bengal governmentâs Duare Sarkar, he said. Bengal has an estimated 73 lakh farmers, with over 96% having small land holdings. Mamata: My ideology matches vision of Indiaâs founding fathersThe Bengal government has argued that the small land-holding pattern, along with employment of share-croppers, makes many Bengal farmers ineligible for the central scheme. The state scheme of an annual Rs 5,000 cash benefit, including Rs 2,000 advance payment, ahead of the Rabi and Kharif seasons is for farmers who have an acre or more of land. âFor all its posturing, the fact is that the Modi government has done nothing to help Bengal. They are yet to release even a portion of the Rs 85,000 crore outstanding dues (including unpaid GST dues of Rs 8,000 crore). If he really wants to help Bengal, he must release at least a part of these funds. We will do everything, including supporting central schemes, that benefits people,â Banerjee said. The CM also reacted sharply to questions regarding her commitment to Bengal. âMy ideology is consistent with the vision of the founding fathers of this country and I have wholeheartedly served the people of Bengal with everything I have. The people of the state are my family. I have full faith that they will not only see through these malicious allegations,â she said. "
"PATNA: Coming a day before the start of its two-day national executive meet at Patna and around four months ahead of the West Bengal assembly polls, JD(U) on Friday received a big jolt as six of its seven MLAs in Arunachal Pradesh (AP) joined BJP with which it has been an alliance partner both at the Centre and in Bihar. AP state BJP chief B R Waghe has accepted the desire of the six JD(U) MLAs to join his party. Expectedly, JD(U) has not taken the AP development charitably. âWas it necessary?â the partyâs general secretary K C Tyagi asked and added: âIt was not necessary at all. What has happened is against the spirit of coalition politics. The matter will be definitely discussed at the partyâs two-day national executive committee meeting at Patna from Saturday and the decision as to the partyâs stand on it will be taken.â In the 60-member AP assembly, BJP emerged as the single largest party winning 41 seats in the 2019 assembly elections, followed by JD(U) with seven seats, Congress and National Peopleâs Party (NPP) four seats each with one to the Peopleâs Party of Arunachal Pradesh. As BJP and JD(U) were not in alliance in AP, the latter became the main opposition party in the House. âIt was the best democratic scenario for BJP and JD(U). BJP was the ruling party and its friendly party JD(U) in the role of the lead opposition party. That could not sustain,â Tyagi said. Observers feel BJP had option as not to accept the letters of intention expressing JD(U) MLAsâ desire to join it. JD(U), however, has been bracing up to contest the assembly elections in West Bengal and Assam. BJP is ruling Assam and has been trying hard to dislodge TMC from power. Further, the BJP-JD(U) relation in Bihar might also enter rough weather, depending upon what stance CM Nitish Kumar takes as the JD(U) national president on the AP developments, observers feel. âThe party has served show-cause notices to three of the six MLAs and had also suspended them from the party for their anti-party activities last month. Now they have done what is visible to everyone,â JD(U) general secretary incharge of the North East, Afaque Ahmad Khan, said. The six JD(U) MLAs who joined BJP are Talem Taboh, Hayeng Mangfi, Jikke Tako, Dorjee Wangdi Kharma, Dongru Shongju and Kanggong Taku. Nitish downplays Arunachal issue Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Friday sought to downplay the split suffered by his party JD(U) in Arunachal Pradesh. Kumar, who is JD(U) national president, sought to dismiss with a bitter laugh the development in the north-eastern state. âWe are focusing on our proposed meeting. They have gone their own way,â Kumar said in response to queries from journalists about the split that came ahead of the JD(U)âs national executive and national council meetings scheduled here this weekend. JD(U) has been contesting assembly polls in a number of states without having a truck with BJP, he said, insisting that its tie-up with the saffron party was âconfined to Biharâ. The party made an exception only in the Delhi assembly polls earlier this year which it fought in alliance with BJP though the coalition suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Aam Aadmi Party.

"NEW DELHI: Protesting farm unions on Friday took strong objection to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's charge that political rivals were misusing farmers protest to push their agenda. ""Parties rejected by the electorate are pushing their political agenda by misleading farmers and using their shoulders to fire at the government as they lack any logical argument against the new farm laws,"" PM Modi said today after releasing over Rs 18,000 crore to more than nine crore farmer families under the 'Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi' (PM-KISAN). ""Defeated in elections, these parties are now indulging in event management for selfies and are appearing on television for publicity,"" he added. The Prime Minister targeted the opposition and said when the agitation started farmers had some genuine demands like guaranteed minimum support price but people with political motives then took over and began making unrelated demands like the release of those accused of violence and making highways toll-free. The farm leaders, however, alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address appeared as an attempt to ""divide and mislead"" the farmers and said they want a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP). Reacting to Prime Minister's allegations that political rivals were misusing the protest to push their agenda, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said unions do not allow any political party to use their stage and accused the government of diverting the issue. Kohar said, ""The prime minister's claim that we are being misguided by other political parties is false. It has been a month since we have been protesting at Delhi borders, and we have not offered our platform to any politician. ""In fact, we have banned them from using our stage. Our protest is not political."" ""In public speeches, the Prime Minister said the MSP will remain. Then why is he afraid of giving a legal guarantee for it? Why cannot the government give it in writing?,"" Shiv Kumar Kakka, a senior leader of Sankyut Kisan Morcha -- an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions -- told news agency PTI. ""PM Modi made an attempt to divide and mislead the farmers during his address today...in election rallies, he says his government has fixed MSP as per the recommendations of the M S Swaminathan Committee. But in court, they say it was not possible to do so,"" Kakka alleged. All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee secretary Avik Saha sought to know why the central government is not giving a legal guarantee on MSP. Saha said the Prime Minister on Friday only addressed farmers from six states and wondered why he did not address issues of protesting peasants. Avtar Singh Mehma, state press secretary, Krantikari Kisan Union (Punjab), alleged that the government's claim that some farmers are in support of the three laws is ""false"". ""We had targeted political parties like the Congress, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the AAP before we came to Delhi. So how can we be misguided by these political parties?,"" Mehma asked Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the ""mandi"" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Centre does not want to solve farmers problems: CongressThe Congress alleged that the government did not want to solve farmers' problem and was trying to âwear them downâ. âThe entire country listened to Prime Minister Modi's clarification on TV today. They say bigger the crime bigger the clarification and the Prime Minister is just doing that,â Surjewala said, claiming that the PM and his ministers are only giving âclarificationsâ without looking into the plight of farmers. âFor a month, farmers are protesting near Delhi's borders in this cold weather. Forty-four of them have already died due to various reasons but the pro-capitalist government is not moved,â senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters here on Friday. âThe Prime Minister and the BJP government is working on the policy of wearing them down. The bitter truth is that the Modi government does not want to solve the farmers' problem,â he claimed. Surjewala said the ruling party leaders are branding farmers as âNaxals, terrorists, Chinese and Pakistan agents, tukde-tukde gang"". The Congress stands shoulder-to-shoulder with farmers as it involved the question of lives and livelihoods of crores of farmers of this country, he said. âThis is not a political fight, this is not the BJP versus Congress fight, not opposition versus ruling party fight,â he said.

"BHOPAL: With BJP levelling allegations of corruption during the 15-month Congress government in the state, former chief minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday said his entire political career has been clean and untarnished. âThe chief minister of the state is levelling false allegations against me,â PCC chief Nath said while addressing a public meeting in Sumawali assembly constituency in Morena district. âLet chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan know that no one has been able to point a finger at me till now. My political life is spotless, neither has my name been mentioned in a dumper scam nor Vyapam scam or e-tendering scam,â Nath said. The senior Congress leader said that he expected after being out of power, Chouhan should have changed his ways and stop indulging in lies. âBut he continues to tell lies. He is making false allegations against me and for this he should come on the dais and apologise to me here,â Nath said. Nath said lies will no longer work in Madhya Pradesh and those who indulged in false propaganda were sent home in the last assembly elections. Nath was campaigning for Congress candidate Ajab Singh Kushwaha who has been fielded from Sumawali seat against BJP minister Aidal Singh Kansana. Speaking at the public meeting, Nath said, âI congratulate the people of the Chambal region who have freed themselves from the maharajas. Now the time has come to free themselves from the clutches of the mafia.â Taking on Kansana, the veteran leader said his government started a campaign against the mafia and everyone knew that the name of the BJP candidate from here was also going to be exposed. âIt was known to all that Kamal Nath cannot be suppressed and cannot be manipulated. That is why people like Kansana have left Congress and bargained to enter BJP,â Nath said. Nath further said that in 15 years of BJP rule, the state got no investments, no industries, no compensation for farmers and no jobs for the youths. He said that former chief minister Arjun Singh had started an industrial zone in Malanpur but today it is bereft of any industry. âIn 15 years, the only industry that started in MP is of alcohol,â Nath said. He said industry did not come to the state because it came to be identified with mafia, adulteration and corruption. "
"US President Donald Trump will spend Christmas Day at his Palm Beach resort as millions of Americans face the risk of losing jobless benefits on Saturday and a partial government shutdown looms next week, following his threat to not sign a $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and spending package. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, whose victory Trump still refuses to acknowledge nearly two months after the Nov. 3 election, is spending the day at his Delaware home and has no public events, according to his staff. Meanwhile, the US Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, will be preparing to return to work. On Monday, following the Christmas weekend, the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on overriding Trump's veto of a $740 billion bill authorizing the country's defense programs. If the House vote succeeds, the Senate could hold its vote as early as Tuesday. The fight over the spending and aid package comes as Americans face an unprecedented holiday season, amid a pandemic that is killing people in record numbers. Nearly 320,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 this year and the daily death toll is repeatedly well over 3,000, the highest since the pandemic began. On Christmas Eve, Trump played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, and tweeted a series of grievances repeating his baseless claims about the election result, including one aimed at Senate Republicans, whom he accuses of abandoning him because many now publicly recognize Biden as the winner. Trump issued dozens of pardons this week, including to former aides convicted for obstructing a federal investigation into Trump's ties to Russia, and to four private security guards convicted of killing unarmed Iraqi civilians. Trump stunned members of both parties when he unexpectedly announced this week his dislike of the $2.3 trillion spending bill, a package that had taken the House and Senate months to negotiate. The bill provides $892 billion in coronavirus relief, and $1.4 trillion in regular government appropriations. Trump, who was represented in the negotiations with lawmakers by treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and had not objected to the terms prior to the House and Senate votes, complained that the package was too full of money for special interests and foreign aid, and said the $600 in direct payments to most Americans was too small, demanding instead that the amount be increased to $2,000. A White House official said Thursday that Trump's threat to not sign the bill should not come as a surprise, noting that Trump had once signed a mammoth omnibus bill against his better judgment and said at the time that he would not do it again. In December 2018, Trump started a 35-day government shutdown when he refused to sign a spending bill that didn't include the funding he wanted for a border wall. Without his signature on the coronavirus aid bill, about 14 million people will lose unemployment benefits on Saturday, and a partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday. It is unclear if Trump will ultimately sign the $2.3 trillion bill. Trump could also choose to take advantage of a situation known as a ""pocket veto,"" rather than outright vetoing the coronavirus aid package. Because the current Congress expires on Jan. 3, Trump could let the normal 10-day period that a president has to sign or veto a bill simply run out. Bills die if they are not enacted during the Congress in which they are introduced. If he does issue a veto, the House and Senate could try and override it next week. Congress might also have to pass a stopgap spending bill on Monday, before money that funds government operations expires at midnight. Also on Monday, the Democratic-controlled House plans to vote on legislation providing one-time, $2,000 checks to individuals to help them during the coronavirus pandemic. "
"GUWAHATI: Rifts have started appearing in All Assam Studentsâ Union (Aasu) over forming a political party by âusing its platformâ. After central executive member of Aasu Simanta Thakuria resigned recently, following differences with president of the student' body, Dipanka Kumar Nath and general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi over their âpolitical activism for AJPâ, Aasu insiders said they are concerned with the image of the organisation as the state gears up for the 2021 assembly polls. âAasu has been an organisation that is put in high esteem, not only in the northeast but in the country. During the six-year long anti-foreignersâ movement (1979-85), the role of Aasu even caught global attention. But the way in which some of the senior leaders of Aasu has been meddled with by AJPâs affairs is a matter of concern. Being an apolitical organisation, its leaders or members cannot associate themselves with the standpoint of a political party or become a proponent of its policies,â a senior office bearer of Aasu told TOI. Thirty-five years after its anti-foreignersâ agitation gave birth to Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), the Aasu and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) in mid-September backed formation of the AJP, which is headed by some of the noted intellectuals and educationists. Conceptualized out of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), AJP has faced criticism from the ruling BJP for allegedly exploiting the sentiments of the people for âpolitical benefitsâ. Aasu central committee vice-president Chittaranjan Basumatary and chief organising secretary Raju Phukan, along with several district level leaders of AJYCP, have already resigned from the respective organizations and have taken charge of AJP. However, the rift inside Aasu is due to the political statements made by incumbent Aasu president Nath and general secretary Gogoi. Simanta Thakuria vented ire on Nath, accusing him of spearheading the political process while holding the presidentâs position in Aasu. Aasu chief advisor Samujjal Bhattacharyya has also distanced himself from the âpolitical statementsâ that are being made by the Aasu president and general secretary. All eyes are now on the 17th general convention of the student body which will be held in Duliajan from November 18-21. Bhattacharyya, Nath and Gogoi, could not be reached for a clarification, but a central executive member of the student body, said, âA new leadership is likely to take over Aasu in Duliajan and bring it to a safe distance from political parties. The apolitical character of Aasu has to be intact. If the AJP fails to do well in the polls, Aasu should not be blamed.â "
"NEW DELHI: Even as China seemed to be wading into Nepalâs latest political crisis, India sought to maintain a safe distance from it saying Thursday that the developments this week in Kathmandu, triggered by PM K P Oliâs decision to dissolve Parliament, were Nepalâs internal affairs. In what was its first reaction to the turmoil in Nepal, the foreign ministry also said that as a neighbour and well-wisher, India will continue to support Nepal and its people in moving forward on the path of peace, prosperity and development. âWe have noted the recent political developments in Nepal. These are internal matters for Nepal to decide as per its democratic process,â said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava. Official sources also said the crisis which has already seen the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) effectively split into two is unlikely to come in the way of Indiaâs development work in Nepal. After Covid-19, and the recent thaw in ties that saw resumption of bilateral meetings even as differences over the Kalapani border issue remained, India had been looking to provide a fillip to its economic and trade ties with Nepal. After the visit by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, the commerce and energy secretaries too had met in quick succession virtually to expedite work on Indian projects in Nepal. Official sources said bilateral engagements will continue with Nepal even if not at the high level. Indiaâs official reaction was in stark contrast to Chinaâs efforts to apparently broker a truce between the Oli and P K Dahal Prachanda factions. Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi has so far met Nepal President B D Bhandari and Dahal since Oli dissolved Parliament on Sunday. A leader considered close to Dahal said Thursday that the NCP co-chair had discussed âbilateral concernsâ with Hou who has worked relentlessly to prevent a split in the party. The Kathmandu Post quoted a member of the Prachandaâs secretariat as saying that âdiscussions must have revolved around contemporary political developments.â In May this year and again in July, Hou held a series of meetings with Bhandari, Oli, Dahal and other NCP leaders as Oli faced pressure to step down. While China had so far worked to garner support for Oli, it's main goal now seems to be to ensure that the Communist alliance remain intact going into the elections next year. Several leaders, as reports from Kathmandu said, had termed the Chinese envoyâs series of meetings with the ruling party leaders as interference in Nepalâs internal political affairs. Oli was earlier removed from the post of partyâs chairman on Tuesday by a central committee meeting of the Prachanda-led faction, which also decided to take disciplinary action against him for dissolving the House of Representatives âunconstitutionallyâ. "
"As the political crisis in Nepal intensifies, the Chinese ambassador in Kathmandu, Hou Yanqi, has set tongues wagging that China could be making one final attempt to keep the flock of warring Communist leaders together. The ambassador met Nepal president B D Bhandari, who had lost no time in approving PM K P Oli's recommendation to dissolve Parliament, Tuesday. While ToI was unable to independently confirm it from any official authority, the ambassador, according to a source in Kathmandu, also met P K Dahal Prachanda, the co-chair of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and one of the chief protagonists in the political drama playing out in Nepal. Hou's meeting with Bhandari was said to be pre-scheduled but it's well known that the ambassador has worked overtime to prevent a split in the ruling party. She had met Oli last month in the middle of his standoff with rival Dahal after the latter listed Oli's alleged failures both as PM and party co-chair in a document he presented before the party and sought his resignation. Dahal was elected parliamentary leader of the party Wednesday. Hou had also courted controversy after she held a series of meetings with NCP leaders in July at a time as many as 30 of the 44 members of the party standing committee were demanding his resignation. The NCP was formed in 2018 with the merger of Dahal's CPN (Maoist Center) and Oli's CPN-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML). It's no secret that China has worked to keep the alliance of ""ideologically like-minded"" forces intact. Beijing is faced with a tough choice though as its favoured Oli's position gets increasingly shaky. Claiming two-third majority in NCP, Dahal has relieved Oli of his post of party co-chair and demanded that the election commission recognise his faction as the legitimate NCP. If the party is split, China will still want the Communist parties to contest elections together, even if it means giving up on Oli. Hou's meeting with Dahal, who finally pulled the plug on Oli, is significant in that context. Apart from the focus on trade and connectivity, China has also worked to build defence ties with Nepal as evident again from defence minister Wei Fenghe's visit to Kathmandu last month. India can perhaps afford to be a lot less edgy about the situation despite signs of a rapprochement with the Oli government in the past couple of months, including a visit by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to Kathmandu. Oli is still seen here as having dealt perhaps the most serious blow to ties with India in recent times with his decision to unilaterally issue a new political map of Nepal showing territories held by India in it. After the resumption of bilateral engagements with India, the Oli government has continued to describe the map as one of its foreign policy highlights. Nepal though has justified its decision citing India's reluctance to hold dialogue on the Kalapani border dispute. "
"NEW DELHI: Former Jammu Kashmir chief minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti has asked the BJP to fight with her politically and ""not through ED, NIA, CID,"" saying democracy is about fundamental rights. ""I want to tell all BJP leaders that fight with me politically, not through NIA, ED and CBI. Democracy is about fundamental rights,"" said Mehbooba Mufti while addressing a press conference in Srinagar. Mufti's comments on the alleged abuse of central agencies comes weeks after Peoples Democratic Party youth wing president Waheed-ur-Rehman's arrest in Davinder Singh terror case. Suspended Jammu and Kashmir DSP Davinder Singh was arrested while ferrying two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen terrorists in a vehicle on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway earlier this year. ""They have nothing to stick to me regarding corruption so they're trying to connect me to terror funding through Waheed-ur-Rehman,"" she said. She also alleged that central agencies were investigating her father's tomb. ""What will you get from these raids? What do I have? If I had anything you wouldn't be going to my father's tomb,"" she said. The ED recently also attached former J&K CM and president of People's alliance for Gupkar Declaration( PAGD) Farooq Abdullah's properties worth Rs 12 crore under Prevention of Money Laundering Act in J&K Cricket Association scam.

"Agra/ New Delhi: In a significant speech to mark centenary celebrations at the Aligarh Muslim University which was wracked by anti-CAA protests a year ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said politics can wait but development cannot even as he assured that the government's policies will work towards ensuring no one is deprived on the basis of religion. Modi said the country is moving on a path where every citizen is assured of his or her constitution-given rights with no one left behind due to oneâs religion and this is the basis of the âsabka saath, sabka vikas, sabk viswasâ pledge. He dwelled on several initiatives for the poor that he said benefited all without discrimination. âI will remind you of something Sir Syed said. A person who thinks of their country, works for the welfare of every person, irrespective of community, religion â¦ For national development, all differences must be set aside. We have to work on a common ground,â he said, recalling the AMU founder. Attending the AMU event via video-conferencing, Modi said development should not be seen through a political prism and that it should be possible to agree on some elements of national interest. Turns here âWe must realise that politics is an important part of society, but there are many other issues in society besides politicsâ¦For a new India, the core is that welfare must not be seen from the prism of politics. There are some elements who may have an issue with this. They can be found in all countries. They will spread negativity. But these people will be sidelined if we work for the betterment of the country keeping politics aside. Politics can wait, society can wait, (but) the country canât wait for development, the poor and disadvantaged canât wait for development.â ""The country is today proceeding on a path where everyone gets equal opportunities to progress,"" the Prime Minister said and underlined AMU's inclusive nature which he said represents a ""mini India"". ""On the one side Urdu is taught, on the other Hindi. Arabic is taught, and so is Sanskrit. In the library, next to Quran manuscripts, translations of Gita and Ramayana rest with just as much care. This diversity is the strength of institutions like AMU, and of India. We should not forget this, or let it weaken. The sentiment of âEk Bharat Shreshtha Bharatâ should be strengthened on AMU campus.â In an important reference, Modi said gender is a âpriorityâ area for the government. âThe dropout rate among Muslim girls was more than 70%. This situation persisted for 70 years. Then, the government started the Swachh Bharat Mission, built toilets in villages and schools. Now, that has dropped to 30% â¦ Triple talaq has also ended,â he said. âIn AMU, female enrolment has gone up to 35%. I congratulate you.â Pointing to AMU's many departments, hostels and thousands of teachers and professors, the Prime Minister said the diversity that was on show was not only the strength of the university but also that of the nation and has to its credit 100 glorious years of excellence in education. Highlighting the contributions of the university in fighting the pandemic, Modi said the institution conducted free tests, made isolation wards and created plasma banks. The PM also hailed the universityâs contribution to the PM Cares Fund. âAll this shows the seriousness of fulfilling your obligations towards society.â Modi is the third PM, after a gap of 54 years, to address the minority institution. AMU was at the centre of anti-CAA protests and saw a spate of arrests earlier this year. âThere are 1,000 international students at this university. It is AMUâs responsibility to showcase what is the best, the strengths of our country ... Whatever they listen to or see at AMU will determine how they see India. That is why your institution has two responsibilities â gain respect for yourself and fulfil your duties â¦ towards nation-building,â he said. The institution, set up in 1875 as the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, was notified as a university in 1920. "
"NEW DELHI: There is no public interest in disclosing details of the donors of political parties, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has held, rejecting a plea for making the details public. The Commission upheld the arguments of the State Bank of India that the information sought by Pune-based RTI activist Vihar Durve was personal in nature held by it in fiduciary capacity. Durve had sought details of donor and donee of electoral bonds from the books of accounts of State Bank of India branches designated to sell these bonds, sources said. After the denial of information by the SBI, Durve approached the commission where he argued that the SBI was supposed to uphold public interest and not the interest of political parties. He said the SBI was not in fiduciary capacity with any political party and hence has no legal duty to maximize the benefit of any public or private sector bank; there was no relationship of ""trust"" between them. Durve had asked that the information was to be disclosed in the interest of transparency and accountability. The SBI, citing Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018, said information about buyers of bonds shall remain confidential and will not be shared with any authority for any purpose. Rejecting Durve's arguments, Information Commissioner Suresh Chandra said, ""There appears to be no larger public interest overriding the right to privacy of the donors and donees concerned."" ""The Commission upholds the contention of the respondent (SBI) that in the disclosure of the names of the donors and donees of electoral bonds from books of accounts may be in contravention of the provisions contained under Section 8(1)(e) (fiduciary capacity) and (j) (personal information) of the RTI Act,"" Chandra held. Speaking to PTI, Durve asserted that it was an ""unreasoned order"" from the CIC as it does not mention the Election Commission, Reserve Bank of India, Law Ministry objections. He said it was the CIC which had brought six national parties under the RTI Act. "

"Nagpur: Incumbent BJP MLA Dr Deorao Holi and former Congress MLA Dr Namdeo Usendi may be from different political outfits but their background of being medical officers of the district hospital is a common factor. Dr Holi had Usendi in the 2014 assembly elections. Usendi proved to be a giant killer in 2009 by defeating the then seating BJP MLA Ashok Nete. The doctors-turned-politicians visit their former workplace even today but with a varied vision and objectives. Though they seldom take up their stethoscopes, they claimed to be feeling never out of place once inside the hospital premises. Gadchiroli which has a recovery rate of 74% is suddenly seeing a spurt in Covid deaths with 11 patients succumbing in the last 10 days. So far, 32 persons have died while 2,850 have recovered in the district. With 109 testing positive on Saturday, the caseload in the district has reached 3,852. Dr Holi said he is hoping to see the RT-PCR testing facility kick off soon in the district, which he had been demanding. âThe role has changed but the concerned has remained the same. As a doctor, it is very heartening to see that the death rate is lesser in the district and so is the rate of infection,â he said. âI have been going to the hospital as an MLA to see the situation and inspect various facilities available there,â he added. Dr Usendi too said he frequented the hospital during the pandemic for reviewing the treatment facilities and study other requirements. âAs a doctor and an MLA, my concern was always to see whether there were adequate oxygen cylinders, quarantine facilities for asymptomatic patients, availability of the medicines and so on,â he said. Dr Usendi said he also met the civil surgeon and district health officials on a number of occasions to review the sitaution in the district. âApart from offering my suggestions as a doctor and MLA, I have been trying to ascertain whether the government has been extending adequate support and facilities to Gadchiroli as a tribal and backward district,â he said. The former district hospital doctor, now a full-time Congress worker, expressed satisfaction in the manner in which the health department has tackled the crisis so far. "
"Gorakhpur: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath slammed the opposition for playing divisive politics and trying to divide society on caste and community lines.

They first divided the country, and are now trying to divide the society on caste, community and region lines. For them their family comes first, while everything else is secondary.â âSamajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party ruled the state for 15 years, but have no achievement except spreading corruption and anarchy,â Yogi said.

"PATNA: To strike a chord with the local voters, different political parties are preparing lists of their senior leaders as star campaigners in the upcoming Bihar election. As per the new Election Commission (EC) guidelines in view of Covid-19, the number of star campaigners for a recognized national or state party has been reduced to 30 from 40 and for an unrecognized party to 15 from 20. Since the EC has also allowed small rallies and public gatherings, every political party has to submit its list of star campaigners to the district election authorities at least 48 hours before the public meeting. For BJP, home minister Amit Shah, partyâs national president JP Nadda and minister of textiles Smriti Irani would spearhead the central campaign teamcampaign. BJP state general secretary Devesh Kumar said the star campaigners would be a mix of central and state leaders. âNadda ji, Amit ji, Smriti ji, partyâs national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, former Maharashtra CM and Bihar election incharge Devendra Fadnavis among other top leaders will be the star campaigners from the central team. From state are Sushil Kumar Modi, union ministers Nityanand Rai, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Giriraj Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad and RK Singh besides Rajiv Pratap Ruddy, Prem Kumar, Radha Mohan Singh, Sanjay Jaiswal and Nand Kishore Yadav,â he said. âThe list will be released phase-wise. Some new faces will be there,â he added. Bihar CM and JD(U) president Nitish Kumar along with other senior leaders would be the star campaigners of his party. JD(U) state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said apart from Nitishji, RCP Singh, Ashok Choudhary, Lalan Singh, Sanjay Jha and Bashishth Narayan Singh and Kehkasha Parveen would be the star campaigners. âThe list will be released phase-wise,â he said. Rajiv said the party would hold small rallies and show on virtual platforms through the digital raths. Congress on Saturday released a list of 30 star campaigners, who include Sonia Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Meira Kumar, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Shaktisinh Gohil, Sachin Pilot, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Shatrughan Sinha, Shakeel Ahmed, Raj Babbar, Pramod Tiwari, Ashok Gehlot and Captain Amarinder Singh.

RJD supremo Lalu Prasadâs wife and former CM Rabri Devi, their sons Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav and daughter Misa Bharti would be the main star campaigners of the party. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said the list would be finalized in the next few days once the candidates for the remaining constituencies are announced. âAltogether 12 leaders have been selected as the star campaigners so far, including four from Lalujiâs family,â he said. âThe list will represent all communities. RJD state president Jagdanand Singh is a Rajput while Shivchandra Ram and Uday Narayan Choudhary represent Dalits, MP AD Singh is a Bhumihar, Alok Mehta a Kushwaha and senior leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui represents the Muslim community,â Tiwari said. He said RJD will hold over 100 rallies and small meetings. âHowever, door-to-door campaigning would be the priority,â he added. "

"PATNA: The opposition Mahagathbandhan said the formation of NDA government in Bihar was betrayal of mandate and boycotted the swearing-in ceremony of Nitish Kumar as CM and other ministers on Monday. No representatives of either RJD or Congress or the three Left parties were present during the function held at Raj Bhavan. RJD, which has emerged the single largest party with 75 members elected to the 243-member legislative assembly, tweeted hours before the swearing-in ceremony: âRJD boycotts this oath taking ceremony. Mandate was for change and against the NDA. But this mandate was changed by âadministrative orderâ. Go and ask the unemployed, farmers, contractual employees and niyojit teachers. People are angry because of NDAâs fraud. We are peopleâs representatives and we stand with them.â Lashing out at the NDA government, RJDâs state president Jagdanand Singh said the term boycott was also not appropriate. âOne which does not even exist, they donât even need to be boycotted,â he said. However, soon after Nitish took oath as the CM, Mahagathbandhan leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav extended his greetings, but in a sarcastic manner. âI hope that the âchairâ does not become the ambition, and instead the government makes issues like public awareness, 19 lakh job promise of NDA, education, medicine and irrigation its priority,â read a part of Tejashwiâs tweet. The three Left parties also abstained from the ceremony. âHow can we go and crown those who have not been voted by the people,â said CPI (ML) state secretary Kunal. Their spokesperson Kumar Parvez alleged, âThey have formed the government by wrong means and have forcefully taken 20 to 25 seats.â Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha also cited the same reasons for skipping the Raj Bhavan ceremony. âThey are forming this government after robbing the mandate,â said Jha. Even the five MLAs of Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM did not attend the event. AIMIM youth wing president Adil Hasan Azad said they were not invited. "
"PATNA: JD(U) president Nitish Kumar was on Monday sworn-in as the chief minister of Bihar for a record seventh time in the past 20 years, amid a boycott of the ceremony by the opposition Mahagathbandhan comprising RJD, Congress and the Left parties. The 69-year old Nitish was administered the oath of office at Rajendra Mandap in the Raj Bhavan premises by governor Phagu Chauhan, a day after Nitish staked claim to form the government, submitting letters of support from all four NDA alliesâJD(U) (43 legislators), BJP (74), HAM-S (4) and VIP (4). The governor also administered the oath of office to 14 ministers, including the two deputy CMs, Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi (both from BJP), replacing Sushil Kumar Modi who had been Nitishâs deputy for around 12 years. Soon after their oath, Prasad and Devi were provided chairs at the dais alongside Nitish Kumar befitting their status as the CMâs deputies. Other ministers were guided to sit at places earmarked for them. It is for the first time that there will be two deputy CMs in Bihar. Six previous governments had a deputy CM but never two. Senior JD(U) leader and former speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary, Bijendra Kumar Yadav, Ashok Choudhary, Mewalal Choudhary and Sheela Kumari were administered the oath of office, next. After that Santosh Kumar Suman of HAM(S), VIPâs Mukesh Sahni and BJPâs Mangal Pandey, Amarendra Pratap Singh, Ramprit Paswan, Jiwesh Kumar and Ram Surat Kumar took the oath of the office from the governor. Of the total 14 ministers, seven are from BJP, five from JD(U), one each from HAM(S) and VIP. Of the total 15, CM Nitish Kumar and BJPâs Mangal Pandey are MLCs (member of legislative council). Two other ministers (Ashok Choudhary and Mukesh Sahni) are not members of any of the two houses in the state. Choudhary and Sahni might be made MLCs against the nomination quota. Of the 14 ministers, nine are first-timers. The new faces in Nitish cabinet are deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, Mewalal Choudhary, Sheela Kumari, Santosh Kumar Suman, Mukesh Sahni, Amarendra Pratap Singh, Ramprit Paswan, Jiwesh Kumar and Ram Surat Kumar. Soon after taking the oath, Nitish said, âBased on the peopleâs mandate, the NDA has once again formed the government in the state. We will work together and serve the people.â âAs our CM has said we will work more to ensure more development across the state. The development will be our agenda,â former speaker and minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said. To a question on Sushil Modi not returning as his deputy, Nitish told reporters, âIt is the decision of BJP not to field Sushil Modi as the deputy CM.â Region-wise, the largest contingent of five ministers is from the Mithila region in north Bihar, while one minister each hails from Kosi, Seemanchal, Magadh, Shahabad, Champaran, Tirhut, Saran and Munger region. The new cabinet will hold its first meeting on November 17 (Tuesday), a government official said. Prominent NDA leaders who attended the swearing-in ceremony were Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP president J P Nadda, Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Harivansh Narayan Singh, former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadanvis, Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Nityanand Rai, BJP general secretary and Bihar Incharge Bhupender Yadav, BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal and JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narain Singh. Two decades ago, Nitish was first sworn in as the CM in March 2000 for a term that lasted barely a week as he failed to muster a majority and was made a minister at the Centre in then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. Five years later, he returned with the JD(U)-BJP alliance winning a majority in November 2005. Upon completion of his five-year tenure, Nitish again returned as CM in November 2010 after the JDU-BJP coalition won a landslide in the assembly election. Nitish stepped down in May 2014, taking moral responsibility for the JD(U) poor show in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He once again returned as the CM in February 2015 when a rebellious Jitan Ram Manjhi was elbowed out. Nitish took oath as the CM for the fifth time in November 2015, heading a government of the Grand Alliance comprising RJD, JDU and Congress. He abruptly came out of the alliance in July 2017, citing charges of corruption against RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, and resigned as the CM only to return in less than 24 hours with the support of the BJP. He took oath as the CM for the sixth time on July 27, 2017. "
"PATNA: The mood was upbeat in the BJP office where Union home minister Amit Shah along with party national president J P Nadda reached on Monday to congratulate the newly elected party MLAs. They had come from Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the NDA government at Raj Bhavan where JD(U) national president Nitish Kumar took the oath as Biharâs chief minister for the seventh time. BJP workers welcomed Shah and Nadda by showering the two leaders with rose petals. Nitish, who took the oath, was clad in a white kurta pyjama and a grey coloured bundi, which he often wears. However, unlike 2015 when the oath ceremony was held in the spacious Gandhi Maidan with two big stages and several national leaders present, this yearâs ceremony was a low-key affair. Besides Shah and Nadda, several national BJP leaders like partyâs Bihar incharge Bhupendra Yadav and former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also graced the occasion. All BJP and JD(U) legislators were also present during the event. Officials at the Raj Bhavan said the ceremony was kept a simple one to ensure the safety of people keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic. âThe event was held at Rajendra Mandap which has a capacity to accommodate around 350 people. It was full to its capacity,â said Raj Bhavan public relations officer SK Pathak. He further said all the guests were instructed to come with masks and were allowed to enter only after getting their temperature checked. âBefore the event, we had sanitized all the chairs,â added Pathak. Nitish and 12 others took oath in Hindi while Ramprit Paswan and Jiwesh Kumar took oath in Maithili. Soon after the ceremony got over, greetings poured in for Nitish. Some of the national leaders who took to social media included union ministers Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Harsh Vardhan and Hardeep Singh Puri, Karnataka CM Yediyurappa and Odisha CM Navin Patnaik. PM Modi also extended his greetings to Nitish and all others who took oath. âI assure all possible support from the Centre for the welfare of Bihar,â read a part of his tweet. SuMo also took to twitter and congratulated Nitish for taking oath as the CM for the seventh time. âUnder your leadership, Bihar will further progress. Bihar will continue to get the support from Shri Narendra Modi,â his tweet read. "
"PATNA: Former minister and seven-time BJP MLA from the Patna Saheb assembly constituency, Nand Kishore Yadav, has emerged as the frontrunner for the post of the Bihar assembly speaker along with another BJP veteran Prem Kumar, an eight-time MLA from Gaya Town. Yadav has been the state president of BJP and was also the leader of the opposition in the assembly after the fall of the NDA government in June 2013. Further, he has been a minister in the NDA government headed by Nitish Kumar four times. He has been elected to the assembly seven times from Patna Saheb (earlier called Patna East) â in 1995, 2000, February 2005, November 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. On Monday, when mediapersons asked Yadav about his being the most likely candidate from BJP for the post of speaker, he repeatedly denied having information on the matter. Interestingly, the eight-time MLA from Gaya Town Prem Kumarâs name is missing from the council of ministers. He hails from the extremely backward caste (EBC) category, while Yadav is an OBC. Earlier, BJPâs Ara MLA, Amarendra Pratap Singh, had been touted to be the most likely candidate for the speakerâs post, a source said, adding that Singh had, however, declined the offer. Singh was sworn in as a minister in the Nitish government on Monday. The day saw Nitish, seven ministers from BJP, five from JD(U) and one each from Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) take the oath of office. The NDA, which has been in power in the state since November 2005, has had two speakers, both from JD(U) â Uday Narayan Choudhary and Vijay Kumar Choudhary. This was because JD(U) had had more MLAs in the House than BJP. This time, BJP has 74 MLAs against JD(U)âs 43. With Vijay Kumar Choudhary being made a minister, JD(U) is unlikely to get the chance to claim the speakerâs post. "
"BETTIAH: Trailing her during the 2000 Bihar polls, TOI had profiled Renu Devi as someone destined to rise on the political horizon of Bihar. Locally described as a âLambi race ki ghodiâ, she has galloped to her victorious destiny from her canter 20 years ago. Meet the new deputy chief minister of the state. Her father Krishna Prasadâ a junior engineer in the state irrigation departmentâmarried her off young to Durga Prasad, an inspector with the Peerless Insurance Company in Howrah. Widowed in 1988, Renu, who had studied up to intermediate level, returned to her paternal home in Bettiah with her two young children, a boy and a girl. With support from her well to do family, Renu started as an insurance agent with her late husbandâs company. In 1991, around the time L K Advaniâs Rath yatra was stopped by the Lalu Prasad government at Samastipur, a young Renu was drawn to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. A year later, she was made the district president of Durga Vahini, the VHPâs women wing, just months before the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992. As a successful Durga Vahini activist, Renu soon joined the BJP. In the 1995 Bihar polls, she was fielded from Nautan. Her political fortunes looked up when BJP shifted her to Bettiah in 2000. The old city area of Bettiah that has had a long history of the Hindu Mahasabha and the RSS provided her with a core organizational support that helped her politically. And, she had the blessings of the Late Madan Prasad Jaiswal, then Bettiah MP, who Renu affectionately called âChachaâ, just as she called-and still calls- everyone âBhaiyaâ. And Bettiah, in turn, has known Renu as âDidiâ. Renuâs entry into the BJP coincided not only with the ascendance of Hindutva, but it also overlapped with the rise of Mandal politics. And in time, social engineering became the mantra of electoral politics. It helped that she was a Nonia- the traditional saltpetre mining casteâ an EBC, which further propelled her on the political racecourse. In 2005, Renu became a minister in the Nitish Kumar government. She retained the Bettiah seat in 2010 but a cabinet berth eluded her. When she lost the 2015 polls, Sushil Kumar Modi, who is among her mentors, asked this reporter in surprise: âHow did Renu lose out?â Today, the giant wheel has turned in such a way that Renu has replaced her mentor as the deputy CM, albeit together with Katihar MLA Tarkishore Prasad- also a leader with RSS moorings.

"PATNA: A day after RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari blamed Congress for the Mahagatbandhanâs loss and attacked Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi for showing no interest in Bihar elections, RJDâs national spokesperson Manoj Jha said it was Tiwariâs personal view and not the partyâs official statement. Jha said all the Mahagathbandhan partners â RJD, three Left parties and Congress â fought with better synergy and coordination and only after proper analysis they could come to any conclusion. âWe (RJD and Congress) have a long relation and we will continue to strengthen this foundation,â said Jha. Tiwariâs statement angered Congress, particularly about Rahul. Tiwari on Sunday questioned Rahulâs seriousness in Bihar elections and said the Congress leader was picnicking at his sisterâs (Priyanka Gandhi) house when the Bihar election was at its peak. Congress Rajya Sabha member and Bihar incharge Shaktisnh Gohil on Monday flayed Tiwari for trying to create fissure in the Mahagatbandhan and indirectly help the NDA government. âShivanand Tiwari ji does not want the week JDU-BJP government to fall apart to pave way for the formation of a Mahagatbandhan government. He is giving such unrestrained statement on instruction of the JD(U) and BJP and trying to support them,â said Gohil, who also called Tiwari âaastin ka saanpâ. He further said Tiwari had changed political parties so many times that he could not remember himself. âHe had even been a JD(U) parliamentarian. His favour to JD(U) is not surprising. Is he not aware of the political history of Bihar that whenever RJD fought without Congress, be it Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha elections, what were the outcome?â Gohil asked. He said Congress always honour the alliance and accepted those seats which the Mahagatbandhan had not won for the past 30 years. âWe also left the seats where Congress had strong claims,â he said. He further said Rahul Gandhi participated in the number of rallies which state Congress had requested him to and gave full time to campaigning in Bihar. âFrom the Mahagatbandhan side, our star campaigners went wherever they were asked to,â Gohil said.

"PATNA: The NDA government took shape in Bihar on Monday with the swearing in of CM Nitish Kumar and 14 other ministers, including seven from BJP, five from JD(U) and one each from Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Vikassheel Insaan Party. Vijay Kumar Choudhary: A JD(U) MLA from Sarairanjan in Samastipur district, Vijay Kumar Choudhary was sworn in as a cabinet minister in Nitish Kumarâs new cabinet. Considered close to Nitish, Choudhary had served as Speaker in the last state assembly. He has been a member of the state assembly since 1982. He is also a member of the JD(U)'s core team. Bijendra Prasad Yadav: A senior JD(U) leader, Bijendra Prasad Yadav had served as energy minister in the last cabinet of Nitish Kumar. After being re-elected from the Supaul assembly constituency, he was sworn in as a cabinet minister on Monday. He has been representing the Supaul assembly seat since 1990. A product of JP Studentsâ Movement, Yadav has a fair image. He has never been involved in any controversy. Ashok Choudhary: A former member of the state legislative council, Ashok Choudhary had earlier served as building construction minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet. He is at present working president of JD(U). Considered to be a close aide of CM Nitish, Ashok joined JD(U) after snapping his ties with the Congress which he once headed in the state. Coming from a family having political background, he took oath as a cabinet minister on Monday. Mewalal Choudhary: A JD(U) MLA from Tarapur in Munger district, Mewalal Choudhary is the former vice-chancellor of Sabour Agriculture University. He lost his wife and former MLA Neeta Choudhary in a gas cylinder explosion last year. Mewalal was elected to the legislative assembly for the first time in 2015 by defeating veteran leader Shakuni Choudhary in 2015. Neeta was elected from the seat in the 2010 assembly polls. Sheela Kumari: She has made her bebut in electoral politics and won from Phulparas in Madhubani district. A greenhorn in politics, she has been elected as MLA for the first time. A postgraduate degree holder, Sheela has mentioned her profession and source of income as agriculture in her affidavit submitted to the election commission. No criminal case is pending against her. Mangal Pandey: A former BJP state president, Mangal had served as health minister in the last Nitish cabinet. He took the oath as cabinet minister on Monday. A resident of Siwan district, he is a member of the legislative council since 2012 and has good influence in the rank and file of the party. A young leader, Mangal is considered close to the top leadership of the party. It was due to his leadership quality that he was made election incharge in Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand earlier. He is credited with strengthening the party during his tenure as state president in 2013. Ram Surat Rai: A BJP MLA from Aurai in Muzaffarpur district, Rai has been inducted as a minister in the new government for the first time. A two-time MLA, Rai comes from a family having political background. Earlier, he was with Nitish- led JD(U) but switched side and contested election on a BJP ticket in 2010 and emerged victorious. In 2015 elections, he lost to Surendra Kumar of RJD. Amrendra Pratap Singh: A BJP MLA from Ara, Amrendra has been inducted in the Nitish cabinet for the first time. Earlier, he was made deputy speaker of the state assembly from 2012-15. The son of former CM late Harihar Singh, he is a four term MLA. He was a member of âJansanghâ in united Bihar. His brother late Mrigendra Pratap Singh had earlier served as Speaker of Jharkhand assembly. Jibesh Mishra: A BJP MLA from Jale in Darbhanga, Jibesh took oath as a minister for the first time. In 2015, he was elected from the seat by defeating Rishi Mishra of JD(U). A law degree holder, Jibesh won the crucial Jale seat by defeating former Aligarh Muslim University Studentsâ Union president Maskoor Usmani, who contested the election on a Congress ticket. Ram Preet Paswan: A BJP MLA from Rajnagar in Madhubani district, Ram Preet was elected on a BJP ticket in 2015. Earlier, he had represented the Khajauli (SC) assembly seat twice in February 2005 and October-November 2005 elections. He was a government teacher before joining politics. He had unsuccessfully contested the 2000 elections from Khajauli. Mukesh Sahani: Popularly called the âSon of Mallahâ, Mukesh is a greenhorn in politics. He has become a minister for the first time. The president of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), Mukesh lost the assembly election from Simri Bakhtiarpur in Begusarai. He had switched over from the opposition Mahagathbandhan to NDA just before the assembly polls. His party won four seats in the 2020 election. Santosh Kumar Suman: The son of former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, Suman is an MLC and has been made a minister from the quota of HAM(S). He is also the chairman of the HAM(S) parliamentary board. He had played an important role in ensuring the victory of HAM(S) candidates in the recently concluded assembly polls. "
"PATNA: Mahagatbandhan (Garnd Allaince) leaders mocked the NDAâs decision to have two deputy chief ministers in the state and cited it as BJPâs well-planned strategy to put pressure on chief minister Nitish Kumar. The GA leaders also said that following the decision to have two deputy CMs there is internal dispute within the NDA. While Nitish Kumar on Monday took oath as the chief minister for the fourth consecutive term, for the first time in the state there will be two deputy CMs. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, âThe BJP has proved that Nitish is just a puppet in their hands. They have made him sit on the driving seat, but they will control the steering. The reason behind two deputy CMs is to ensure proper check on Nitish Kumar.â He alleged, the decision to remove Sushil Modi from this post has created an uproar in both the BJP and the RJD. Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre also cited similar reasons. âTwo deputy CMs are nothing but two guards kept by the BJP to keep an eye on Nitish. Earlier, BJP had provided Nitish with a munshi (Sushil Kumar Modi), but that munshi became Nitishâs stepney and hence he has been removed,â said Rathorre. Another Congress spokesperson Harkhu Jha said, âBJPâs decision to not to make SuMo the next deputy CM was a part of strategy. He even alleged several scams during SuMOâs tenure as a reason for not giving him this coveted post and said the newly-formed government will not continue for long.â However, JD (U) state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan hit back at the opposition for raising issues which were baseless. Ranjan said it was BJPâs decision to have two deputy CMs and they did this from their own quota. âWe have no problem with it. In fact, chief minister Nitish Kumar is an able administrator and knows how to lead his cabinet well. Two deputy CMs will further help in smooth functioning of the government and provide extra hand to the CM and help me realise the goal of development,â said Ranjan, adding, âNitish Ji has not formed this government for providing benefit to his family. He works for the people of Bihar, unlike opposition which had the sole purpose of personal benefit.â "
"PATNA: Nitish Kumar is at the helm of Bihar again, but with a radically changed script and team. His âsistersâ may have âcrushed all his enemiesâ, as Usha Devi said on âBhai Doojâ on Monday before his swearing-in, but Nitish has new challenges and so has the BJP â now the big brother in Bihar NDA with 74 MLAs compared to JD(U)âs 43. Also, half of the 14 ministers sworn-in are from BJP, including the two deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, who are deeply rooted in the âSanghâ ideology and likely to keep the organization above alliance interests. The NDA government has a wafer-thin majority in the House with 126 MLAs, including four each from Jitan Ram Manjhiâs HAM(S) and Mukesh Sahaniâs VIP as well as one Independent MLA against the opposition strength of 110 members in the 243-member House. The body language of Nitish indicates the kind of predicament he is facing and might not have imagined before. As reported in the media on Sunday, Nitish told the NDA legislators at their meeting that he wanted someone from BJP to be the chief minister, but was accepting the post on the insistence of saffron party leaders. He reportedly made this remark in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh, who had come as the BJP observer to facilitate the government formation exercise and name two leaders for the deputy CMâs post. A strong opposition bench will ensure that the road ahead for Nitish will be rocky in the assembly. âBest wishes to respected Shri Nitish Kumar Ji on being nominated as the chief minister. I hope that instead of the ambition of the chair, you will make the 19 lakh jobs and positive issues like education, medicine, earning and irrigation as governmentâs priority,â tweeted the leader of RJD and the opposition Mahagathbandhan, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who emerged as a strong leader outside the shadow of his father Lalu Prasad. Though Nitish, after taking oath as the CM for the 7th time, said he would deliver on the responsibility bestowed by the people of the state and dismissed the challenges as nothing new. âHar bar kuch nayapan rahta hin hai (every time there is something new),â he said when asked about his former deputy Sushil Kumar Modi and the new BJP leaders by his side. Former Assembly Speaker and one of the five JD(U) ministers sworn in on Monday, Vijay Choudhary was confident of handling new challenges. âUnder the leadership of Nitish, we will overcome all challenges and take the state development work forward in Bihar,â he told media persons at the Raj Bhavan. But the electoral verdict has put Nitishâs JD(U) and BJP on a crossroads to take the future political course as both the parties will need to groom leadership to handle the challenges posed by Tejashwi and LJP chief Chirag Paswan in the next elections. BJP lacks a leader with mass appeal in Bihar as it cannot bank on PM Narendra Modi all the time to romp home. Only time will tell whether Nitish remains as much comfortable with the two BJP deputy CMs as he was with Sushil Modi but one thing is for sure that the saffron party, as well as the JD(U), needs second-rung leaders to fight the future political battle in Bihar against the formidable opponents with a solid vote base. That BJP will push its agenda and widen its base is evident from the fact that the party made a man from OBC and a woman from EBC as deputy CMs besides ministers from Dalit and Mahadalit communities, which were so far considered the support base of Nitish and his party. Since BJP has achieved the first target of scoring more than JD(U), the Bihar verdict will boost the party morale in other states like West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala where elections are due before May next year. "
"PATNA: It is a measure of his long-felt utility, clout, strength, and his innate quality of resilience in the face of adverse circumstances that Sushil Kumar Modi, BJP leader and former deputy CM, may yet emerge as a big survivor in the not so distant future, even though he may appear sidelined at present, observers say. âThe partyâs central leadership might decide to rehabilitate Sushil Kumar Modi in ways that it thinks proper. He could be made a central minister, even head of the GST council. There are several options before the central leadership,â state BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said. âBut his experience, control over various kinds of information, including about the stateâs economy and the partyâs affairs, and his ability to spot talent in the party even in the districts and to access them will be missed,â Patel added. That notwithstanding, the most important topic of discussion after CM Nitish Kumar was the removal of the deputy CM tag from SuMo. Indeed, on Sunday afternoon, the question being asked around in whispers was whether PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah were in any way instrumental in the fall of SuMo? For, it was certain that SuMo will not figure in the council of ministers, and, in the circumstances, as per his admission, he will be happy to carry the tag of BJPâs âparty worker,â something no one could âtake awayâ from him. Back in August 2012, a month after CM Nitish Kumar had told in an interview to an English daily from Delhi that he had reservations about then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi becoming the BJPâs âprime ministerial candidateâ, SuMo had told another English daily that Nitish was âPM material.â Soon, a group of Bihar BJP leaders like Dr C P Thakur, Giriraj Singh, Rameshwar Chaurasia and Ashwini Kumar Choubey emerged on the scene as hardcore followers of NaMo and started rooting for him in Bihar as the partyâs âPM candidateâ. Curiously, two years earlier in 2010, both Nitish and SuMo had maintained that campaigning by NaMo was not needed during the Bihar assembly election that year as his presence would not be in the interests of the NDA. However, with PM Modi and Shah at the helms of affairs of both the country and in BJP, SuMoâs skill and utility were mustered in April 2017 to launch a campaign against RJD chief Lalu Prasad, his wife Rabri Devi, and their children, especially then deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and health minister Tej Pratap Yadav, pointing to omissions and commissions on their part. To put it laconically, it amounted to muckraking by SuMo to tarnish the image of the âLalu familyâ further as ED raids followed. In between, what is called the Srijan scam surfaced, but it was turned into a side issue, virtually buried. Suddenly, in July 2017, Nitish walked out of the grand alliance and formed NDA government with the BJP in the state, and SuMo also got rehabilitated as deputy CM after the BJPâs debacle in the 2015 assembly polls. Attempts were made to clip the wings of SuMo in BJP from 2016. Then state BJP president Nityanand Rai ignored SuMo supporters in the partyâs structure. SuMo was virtually isolated in Bihar BJP, as upper caste functionaries of the party were also opposed to him. The situation for Nitish and SuMo became critical after the death of then Union finance minister Arun Jaitley last year, as the latter was their important voice even in the new dispensation. The rest, as they say, is history. "
"PATNA: LJP chief Chirag Paswan, who has of late become an eyesore for the JD (U), congratulated Nitish Kumar after being sworn in as the chief minister of the state for the fourth consecutive term on Monday. âCongratulations to you for being the CM once again and congratulations to BJP for making you the CM,â Nitishâs bÃªte noire Chirag tweeted after the swearing-in ceremony at the Raj Bhavan. Chirag was one of the first politicians to thank Nitish for being elected as the CM for the fourth consecutive time. The Jamui MP did not stop there. He further tweeted in Hindi, âI am sending you the vision document prepared by four lakh Biharis so that you can implement some of them. Congratulations once again on becoming CM and BJP for making you the CM.â Chirag hoped that the NDA government led by Nitish Kumar would complete its five year term. âI hope the government will complete its tenure and you will continue to be CM of NDA,â another tweet of the LJP chief read. LJP had contested the recently concluded assembly polls solo and could manage to win only one seat out of the 135 constituencies it had contested. Chirag, however, claimed that his mission was complete and he fought the election to force the JD (U) to bite the dust at the hustings. The JD (U), an important ally of the NDA, won 43 seats in the 243-member state assembly. However, the BJP's tally rose to 74 in this election from 53 in the 2015 assembly polls. "
"BERLIN: The total number of deaths in Germany caused by the coronavirus crossed the 40,000 mark on Sunday, the centre for disease control announced. Germany recorded 465 deaths over the past 24 hours, the Robert Koch Institute said, raising the toll since the start of the pandemic to 40,343. More than 1.9 million people have been infected so far, with almost 17,000 new cases added since Saturday. In her weekly video message on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the full impact of socialising over the Christmas and New Year's period was yet to show up in the statistics. She warned Germans that the coming weeks will be ""the hardest phase of the pandemic"" so far, with many doctors and medical staff working at their limits. Germany fared better than many other European countries during the first Covid-19 wave in the spring but it has been hit hard by the second wave. The nation of some 83 million people, the bloc's most populous, has imposed another round of restrictions to limit social contacts and help hospitals cope with a surge in patients. More than 5,000 Covid-19 patients are currently in intensive care nationwide, with more than 80 percent of intensive care beds occupied. Germany has closed schools and non-essential shops, culture and leisure facilities until at least January 31 in the hopes of slowing the outbreak. Like other EU nations, it started vaccinating citizens against Covid-19 in late December using the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. More than half a million have received the jab so far. Merkel acknowledged the vaccine campaign had got off to a slow start, ""but the tempo will pick up"", she said. ""What's important is that we can say: we will have enough of the vaccine available for everyone in Germany,"" she added. ""Month after month we will inoculate more people and eventually we will be able to offer the vaccine to anyone who wants it."" "
"FRANKFURT AM MAIN: Germany hit a new record level of coronavirus deaths as it entered a harder lockdown Wednesday, closing shops and schools to try to bring down stubbornly high new cases. The country recorded 179.8 deaths of new infections per 100,000 residents over the last seven days, a new high and significantly more than the 149 per 100,000 reported a week ago by the Robert Koch Institute, the country's disease control center. It also blew past its previous daily total, with Germany's 16 states reporting 952 people had died of the virus, the agency said. That was far greater than the previous daily record set Friday of 598 deaths, although included two days of figures from the hard-hit eastern state of Saxony, which did not report Tuesday. It brought the country's overall pandemic death toll to 23,427. Faced with exponentially increasing cases in October, Germany implemented a âlockdown lightâ at the start of November, which closed bars and restaurants but left shops open. The measures succeeded in leveling off the numbers of new daily infections, but didn't bring them down, prompting the new stricter restrictions. In addition to closing shops and moving children to remote learning for the few days before the Christmas holidays, private gatherings are being limited to two households with a maximum of five people, among other things. The measures are expected to be in place until at least Jan. 10 and enjoy wide support, with the latest polls showing more than 80% of Germans approve of the lockdown restrictions or think they should be stricter. Germany was widely praised for slowing the spread of its outbreak in the spring, but as people grew lax with distancing and mask rules over the summer the numbers of cases started to climb again. While daily new cases peaked at about 6,000 in March, they are now more than four times that level, with 27,728 new cases reported Wednesday by the Robert Koch Institute. The number of new infections per 100,000 residents over the last seven days hit a record high of 179.8, the agency reported. German officials have pressed the European Union's regulatory agency hard to speed up its approval of a coronavirus vaccine, and the European Medicines Agency has scheduled a meeting on that for Monday. With vaccinations expected to start before year's end, German officials have urged people to stay patient and respect the regulations over the holidays. Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany was ready to start rolling out the vaccine and could begin vaccinations within two to four days of European approval. âBy summer we'll be able to return to normal, step by step,â he said on RTL television Wednesday.

"BERLIN: Several people were injured in a gas explosion on Friday in or near a building in the southern German town of Memmingen. The explosion occurred at about 6am and damaged the building used by the Bavarian Red Cross, which also had apartments above, authorities told the dpa news agency. Five people were injured, one seriously, police said. The source of the explosion was a defective gas line that ran under the street in front of the building, dpa reported. Authorities warned that other explosions were possible and evacuated the area. The building was badly damaged, police said. "
"BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of Germany's 16 states are expected Tuesday to extend and tighten a partial lockdown beyond January, as fears grow over virus variant strains believed to be more contagious. Draft measures seen by AFP ahead of the emergency talks include prolonging current restrictions until at least mid-February, requiring medical masks on public transport and in shops, and increasing pressure on employers to allow staff to work from home where possible. Germany shuttered restaurants, leisure and sporting facilities in November, then expanded the shutdown in mid-December to include schools and most shops to halt runaway growth in new coronavirus infections. The measures ordered until the end of January have brought about a ""flattening of the infections curve"", said Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert, noting also that the number of patients in intensive care had also fallen slightly. ""This trend is cautiously positive, he said, and an achievement of the restrictions of the last weeks. ""But it only brings us to the point where we still have a long way to go before we can say we have the infections under control."" Virus variants first seen in Britain and South Africa also posed major risks to whether the falling infections trend could be sustained, added Seibert. The crisis talks between Merkel and state premiers were brought forward by a week because of the virus variants. ""It is a risk that responsible politicians must take into account -- sooner rather than later,"" he added. Germany survived the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic relatively well, but a second wave hit Europe's biggest economy hard. New infections have soared far above the 50 per 100,000 people threshold set by the government. And just last Thursday, the country saw a new high in daily deaths of 1,244. On Tuesday, daily deaths reached 989 though health authorities said they might have been inflated after a lag in weekend reporting. More than 11,000 new cases were recorded. Seibert noted Monday that the incidence rate was still at over 130 per 100,000, and that Germany ""must more quickly"" bring that down to 50. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier last week issued a joint appeal with union and employer federation representatives, urging firms to have staff work from home ""whenever possible"". More could be done to keep non-essential workers out of the office and off public transport, they said. Experts have been alarmed by data showing that while a first shutdown last spring had led to a sharp drop of 40 percent in mobility, this winter, far more people appear to be on the move. Disease control agency Robert Koch Institute and Berlin's Humboldt University have found from data collected from mobile phone signals that last Wednesday, the mobility of Germans was only 15 percent below that from a year ago. RKI chief Lothar Wieler has pleaded for rigorous implementation of curbs that have already been ordered, saying that there were too many exceptions being offered. In northern Germany, authorities were planning to take more drastic measures against people who breach quarantine rules. Schleswig-Holstein state's justice ministry is turning a youth detention centre into a forced quarantine site for those who do not isolate themselves when required to. "
"CHENNAI: Alexander Zverev bounced back after a tough singles defeat to World No. 1 Novak Djokovic Friday to send Germany into the ATP Cup semi-finals in Melbourne for the first time. The World No. 7 partnered Jan-Lennard Struff to victory in the deciding doubles rubber against Djokovic and Nikola Cacic 7-6(4), 5-7, 10-7. Struff was Germany's hero, having earlier won the No. 2 singles against Dusan Lajovic, before teaming with Zverev to seal the tie for Germany 2-1, knocking out the defending champion. Germany advances to face Russia, the Group D winner, in Saturday's semi-finals, with the final to be played Sunday. Team Russia is led by the double threat of Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, who are both ranked inside the Top 10 in the FedEx ATP Rankings. (Action from the ATP Cup will continue LIVE on Eurosport and Eurosport HD on Saturday, February 6, 2021, with the semi-final matches between Germany vs. Russia and Italy vs. Spain from 11:30 AM IST onward.) ""Obviously, [Russia is a] great team. Daniil Medvedev [is in] great shape. Rublev [is in] very good shape. But we too are also in good shape, so [it is] going to be [a] very interesting, intense tie and I hope we can beat them,"" said Germany captain Mischa Zverev. In a dramatic doubles, the Germans won six straight points from 2/4 down in the Match Tie-break, freezing out Djokovic at every opportunity and directing as much traffic as possible to the more inexperienced Cacic. In last year's ATP Cup final, Djokovic backed up from his singles win over Rafael Nadal to partner Viktor Troicki in the deciding doubles, which earned Serbia the inaugural title. ""I think we played maybe a little bit more aggressive [in the doubles]. In the end, we maybe took a few more shots, but it was so tight it could have gone both ways,"" said Alexander Zverev. ""At the end of the day, when you win the doubles decider 10-7 in the third set there's not much between the two. We're just super happy right now."" In the No.1 singles match, Djokovic extended his record at the ATP Cup to 11 straight victories after winning a three-set thriller against Zverev 6-7(3), 6-2, 7-5 to keep defending Serbia alive in the tie. ""I thought we both played well,"" Djokovic said on court. ""He definitely had a big serving match. It was so difficult to play against him today. Missiles from the other side of the court, both first and second serve. He was going for it, not too many double faults. You've got to give him credit for being courageous and trying his best... Overall it was a very enjoyable match."" There was little to separate Zverev and Djokovic throughout a tense opening set under the roof in Rod Laver Arena. There were no break-points on offer as both players leaned on big first serves to take control of the rallies. Zverev pulled away in the tiebreak and closed out the set with an ace. The Serbian adjusted his return position to deal with Zverev's powerful second serves, the German gambling with first-serve levels of speed and power. Djokovic took a step back and was rewarded with his first break of the match. He reeled off three games in a row to take a 5-2 lead with a perfectly placed lob landing plumb on the line. Djokovic broke through late in the third set to take a 5-4 lead, but struggled to close it out the as the German saved a match point. With his back against the wall, Zverev finally earned his first break chance of the match in the third, breaking the World No. 1 to level the score. But two double faults in the next game undid his effort, and gave Djokovic the opening to break back and claim his 11th consecutive ATP Cup victory. "
"BERLIN: Germany is facing a ""very serious"" rise in coronavirus cases, the head of the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre said Thursday, as the country reported a record 11,287 new infections. It is still possible to bring the virus under control through ""systematic compliance with restrictive measures"", Lothar Wieler said. But ""the overall situation has become very serious,"" he added. Germany, like many European countries, has been facing a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases for several weeks. Thursday's caseload far exceeds the previous record of 7,830 recorded last Friday, and is a steep jump from the 7,595 cases reported on Wednesday. Faced with the rebound, authorities have toughened measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, such as banning large gatherings. Local restrictions have also been imposed -- in Berlin, it is now compulsory to wear a mask on certain busy streets. Wieler on Thursday blamed private gatherings, especially among young people, for the dramatic rise in cases. ""The more people gather in private circles, the more the numbers will increase and the further the virus will spread,"" he said, noting that ""the young are currently the most exposed to this virus"". Wieler urged people to observe the rules but cautioned that an ""uncontrolled"" spread could be unavoidable in some regions. On Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel asked citizens to cut down on socialising, encouraging them to stay at home instead. ""What winter will be, what our Christmas will be, will be decided in the days and weeks to come,"" she warned. At least 392,049 people have been infected in Germany since the outbreak of the virus, with 9,905 deaths reported. "
"NEW DELHI: India and Germany have finally reached an equitable agreement on flights to be operated by airlines of both countries under the air bubble agreement. Lufthansa will now operate 10 weekly flights â four to and from Delhi and three each to and from Mumbai and Bengaluru. Air India will operate seven flights a week with five to and from Delhi and two from Bengaluru. A disagreement had arisen between India and Germany last month due to the disparity in the number of flights being operated by Lufthansa and AI. A senior Indian aviation official had then said while AI was operating three to four flights a week to and from Germany, Lufthansa was having 20 flights here. India had last month offered seven flights a week to Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. As a result of this disagreement, Lufthansa had cancelled all its planned India flights between September 30 and October 20. Germany had withdrawn permission for AI to operate flights to Frankfurt in the first half of October. Due to this the Maharaja had cancelled all the 12 flights that were operate from October 1 to 14. Now, with India and Germany finalising a more equitable number of flights â Lufthansa 10 weekly and AI 7 instead of the earlier AI 3-4 weekly and Lufthansa 20 â flights will resume. Aviation minister H S Puri tweeted on Wednesday saying: âFlights between India and Germany recommence under air bubble arrangement. Lufthansa will operate from Delhi (4 days), Mumbai (3 days) and Bengaluru (3 days). Air India will operate 5 weekly flights from Delhi and 2 every week from Bengaluru to Frankfurt.â Flights between India & Germany recommence under air bubble arrangement. Lufthansa will operate from Delhi (4 days)â¦ https://t.co/9cNyCQIZcH— Hardeep Singh Puri (@HardeepSPuri) 1603286609000Under the air bubble agreement with Lufthansa and Air France, Indian passengers were supposed to travel only between India and the EU on these airlines. The special arrangement conditions meant an Indian passenger eligible to travel under current rules could not fly from India to Germany and then take a connecting flight from there to North America. However, the EU carriers were taking that traffic also and were asked to abide by the terms of the air bubble. Accordingly, the Lufthansa website now says that âspecial criteria apply on Lufthansa flights to/from India under the Indian air travel bubble. Kindly ensure that you fulfil one of the below listed eligibility criteria: All diplomats travelling between India and anywhere on the Lufthansa Group network; Any Indian national holding a valid visa and all Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders holding passports issued by any country in the EU/Schengen area, South America or Africa only and destined for any country in the EU/Schengen area, South America or Africa; Foreign nationals/residents destined for the EU/Schengen area, South America or Africa or spouses of these persons, whether accompanying or otherwise and destined for any country in the EU/Schengen area, South America or Africaâ¦â Lufthansa had scheduled flights to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai in October. Due to the number of flights allowed, Chennai will have to wait for some time before it can get Lufthansa flights. Vistara has been planning flights to Frankfurt and Paris under Indiaâs air bubbles with Germany and France. Once and if it does so or AI adds flights to Frankfurt/Munich and the number of flights by Indian carriers to Germany increases, Lufthansa may also be allowed more flights proportionately while keeping equitability the key factor between both sides, say sources. "
"BERLIN: Germany will extend its current coronavirus restrictions through to early January unless there is a dramatic drop in infections -- something that is not expected, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday. Merkel said the measures introduced in early November, including limits on private gatherings and the closure of restaurants, leisure and cultural facilities, cannot be lifted given current infection rates. The curbs will be continued ""until December 20 first but we assume that ... due to the very high incidence of infection, restrictions will have to apply until the beginning of January,"" Merkel said. The agreement means continued closures for restaurants, bars, sporting facilities and cultural venues in Europe's biggest economy, though schools and shops will remain open. From December 1, private gatherings will be limited to five people from two households -- down from 10 people currently, though children are exempted from the new rule. For the festive period from December 23 to New Year's day, rules on gatherings will be slightly eased to allow up to 10 adults meeting, with children under 14 exempted. But this does not mean that parties will be allowed, according to a deal hammered out by Merkel's government and Germany's 16 states -- rather, the motto for the period will be to remain at home. ""Employers are urgently requested to check if company holidays or home working solutions can be applied from December 23 to January 1 to allow companies to close, so that nationwide, we can implement the basic principle 'we are staying home',"" according to the agreement. Other measures agreed include trains expanding their seating capacity, in order to better ensure distancing between passengers. Fireworks will be banned on certain public squares to prevent people from gathering in large groups on New Year's Eve in particular. Germany will also seek a deal with European partners to close ski slopes through to early January, to prevent the virus spreading further. ""I will say this openly that it won't be easy, but we will try,"" Merkel said. The measures were agreed after more than seven hours of tense talks, with some less-affected regions calling for lighter restrictions. The number of new infections in Germany has plateaued over the past two weeks, with October's exponential growth brought to a halt. However, health officials have sounded the alarm over rapidly filling intensive care units and an inability to track the source of transmission while rates remain high. In order to ease restrictions, the infection rate would have to come down to below 50 new cases per 100,000 people per week, Merkel said -- a far cry from the current seven-day incidence of almost 140. ""The steeply rising curve has become a flat one, but this is only a partial success. We can by no means be satisfied,"" she said. Germany has registered a total of 961,320 coronavirus cases and 14,771 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre. Wednesday saw 18,633 new cases and a record 410 deaths. "
"FRANKFURT: Sales of battery-electric vehicles in Germany increased three-fold to more than 194,000 units in 2020, the country's road-traffic regulator said on Wednesday, citing the appeal of a more diversified product offering and of more reliable technology.  ""E-mobility has become a mainstream feature of the mobile society,"" the president of German regulator KBA, Richard Damm, said in a statement.  Since vehicles with full or partial electric propulsion reached a market share of 22% in the fourth quarter of 2020, the German government was well on its way to reach its goal to have 7 million to 10 million registered electric vehicles on German roads by 2030, he added  Battery-electric vehicles made up 1.2% of all registered passenger cars in Germany at the end of 2020, up from 0.5% a year earlier, KBA said.

"SEVILLE: Spain coach Luis Enrique paid tribute to every player in his squad after Tuesday's incredible 6-0 win over Germany to reach the final four of the UEFA Nations League, which he said was just what they deserved for their efforts over the campaign. ""This victory belongs to every player, even those who didn't play,"" Luis Enrique told reporters after his side finished top of League A4 above Germany. ""It would be unfair to single anyone out because to do what we did, to press a team like Germany all over the pitch, you need every player from defence to attack to work hard."" Nations League: Stunning Spain hit Germany for six as Giroud stars in France's winLuck seemed to desert Spain in Saturday's 1-1 draw in Switzerland as they missed a slew of chances including two penalties, while they were unfortunate to lose 1-0 to Ukraine last month. Yet everything clicked in an astonishing display against the 2014 World Cup winners, as midfielders Fabian Ruiz, Koke and Rodri dictated play and forward Ferran Torres bagged a hat-trick. ""This was one of those nights that happen very rarely, when everything goes exactly as planned. The players went out all fired up and did everything right. This is what you get when you combine quality and attitude,"" Luis Enrique added.

"BERLIN: The German government and the country's 16 federal states have agreed to extend a strict lockdown until Jan. 31 in an effort to bring coronavirus infections under control, Bild newspaper reported on Monday, without providing a source. Chancellor Angela Merkel and the state premiers are scheduled on Tuesday to discuss a possible extension of the lockdown beyond Jan. 10. Some, including Bavaria's premier Markus Soeder, have already spoken in favour of an extension. Speaking after the Bild report, a government source told Reuters: ""All but two federal states support (a lockdown extension until) Jan. 31. However, the formal decision will be made on Tuesday."" Germany was more successful than many European countries in keeping the coronavirus in check during the first wave in the spring but has seen a surge in new infections since the autumn. It imposed a second hard lockdown on Dec. 16, closing schools, shops and restaurants after a partial lockdown introduced in early November did not bring the hoped-for reduction in new infections. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany, which has a total population of around 83 million, increased by 9,847 to 1.76 million in a day, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday. The reported death toll rose by 302 to 34,574. The situation in Germany's hospitals has become ""extremely difficult"", a government spokesman told a news conference on Monday. The federal states will take the decision on when and how schools will reopen, the education ministers agreed on Monday. They recommend a three-step procedure, which would see the first six grades return first, flexible teaching times for pupils from the seventh grade in a second step and a broad return to classrooms in a third step. Like other European Union countries, Germany started vaccinating its population against COVID-19 in late December, but officials and media have expressed frustration with the slow rate of progress. Only 265,986 people had received a first shot by Monday, according to the RKI. This compares with more than a million people in Britain, which approved the vaccine developed by Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech earlier than the EU and also began innoculating with Oxford University and Astrazeneca's vaccine on Monday.

"Mumbai: The pecking order of international education providers is changing. The United States continues to be the largest host country for students wanting to pursue a foreign degree, followed by the UK and China. But with students broadening their options, Germany has gained popularity and has climbed up one notch to occupy the fourth spot, upstaging France. Fresh data released from the German Academic Exchange Service, DAAD, shows that China and India are the most popular source countries for international students coming to Germany, making up around 13% and 7% of the international pool respectively. With that, Germany has gone ahead of France. According to the UNESCO 2019 data, China sits formidably at the third spot. âInternational students are extremely interested in studying in Germany despite the corona pandemic; expectations are that the coming years will see recovery in the declining figures and an increase beyond previous levels,â read a DAAD presser. âThe corona pandemic has altered international studentsâ mobility patterns on a global basis. This is a good starting point from which we can in future convince even more talented young people of the benefits of our education system and thus connect them to our country,â said DAAD president Joybrato Mukherjee. The most significant countries of origin for international students coming to Germany in 2019 were China, with around 40,000 students, followed by India (20,600), Syria (13,000), Austria (11,500) and Russia (10,500). Interestingly, student numbers from Germanyâs third largest source country, Syria, have soared by 275% in the last three years. The 13,000 Syrians studying in Germany in 2019 accounted for 4% of international students; the vast majority are refugees. In 2001, 2.1 million students from across the world left home in pursuit of higher education; the numbers in 2019 were about 5.3 million. While Canada and China have during this period become top draws, the USâs hold has loosened, the UK has found it difficult to add big numbers and smaller Asian nations like Singapore have marched in for space. Speaking of the rise of the Asian region, Rajika Bhandari, Raisa Belyavina and Robert Gutierrez in their work âStudent Mobility and the Internationalization of Higher Educationâ have noted, âWhile this has resulted in a somewhat smaller market share for top host countries, it is nonetheless a positive development as it has brought more countries into the field of international education and has changed the relationship between sending and receiving countries from a unidirectional âbrain drainâ type of mobility to one of dynamic, mutual exchange.â The trio feels the journey from being a nation which sees its scholars leave the shores for greener academic pastures to becoming a magnet for students from around the world is a long one, fraught with challenges. They have said: âThey (the rising Asian countries) are likely to face the dilemma of how to increase the capacity of their higher education systems to provide adequate opportunities for their expanding college-age population while also accommodating incoming international students and engaging in the type of international educational exchange that is necessary in todayâs globally competitive world.â "
"BERLIN: It was over breakfast on the wintry morning of January 24 that Ozlem Tureci and her husband Ugur Sahin decided, ""we need to fire the starting gun on this"". Sahin ""had concluded from a publication describing coronavirus cases in Wuhan... that there was a high probability that a pandemic could be imminent"", Tureci recounted. The decision by the couple, founders of a small German company called BioNTech, gave birth to Operation Lightspeed -- in which the scientists in the company diverted all their resources from cancer therapy research to finding a vaccine to stop Covid-19. ""Since that day... there has not been a day when we took a break from working on this project,"" said Tureci. Four days later, on January 28, Germany confirmed its first case of coronavirus infection -- also the first known human-to-human transmission on European soil. What was an epidemic hitting China hardest soon morphed into a global health crisis, forcing governments to close borders, schools and offices and keep their populations at home to halt the spread. As BioNTech and other pharmaceutical companies leapt into action in search of the winning formula, Germany's army of ""Mittelstand"" companies and other bigger manufacturing and logistics experts would soon prove crucial. Just a few minutes' drive away from BioNTech's headquarters in the city of Mainz, one such company quietly ramped up production. Little known to the rest of the world, the 130-year-old firm Schott is in fact a major player in the pharmaceutical industry because of its little glass vials designed to hold life-saving vaccines. Three-quarters of the more than 100 coronavirus inoculation trials across the world would end up using Schott products. The company alone aims to produce enough vials to hold two billion doses of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2021, head of communications Christina Rettig told AFP. Schott itself had an early scare with the virus at its Mitterteich plant in Bavaria. The town became one of Germany's first coronavirus hotspots in March after a beer festival, and Rettig said several Schott workers from the Czech Republic ended up ""not seeing friends and family for weeks"" as borders slammed shut. With passenger flights mostly grounded, the buzz at Frankfurt airport's terminals all but vanished to a hush in the spring. Its freight area however kept humming. Tens of thousands of boxes of urgently needed surgical gowns and masks were transiting through. The head of freight infrastructure at Fraport, Max Philipp Conrady, knew that was just the beginning for his division in the pandemic battle. No one knew then which company would find a vaccine or when it would be ready, but Frankfurt is already Europe's largest hub for transporting pharmaceutical goods. And so planning had to begin for the unprecedented logistical challenge of transporting millions of life-saving vaccine doses worldwide. Fraport's vast temperature-controlled hangar handled 120,000 tons of vaccines, drugs and other pharmaceutical products in 2019. The operator anticipated the demand for cold storage, and boosted investments in high-tech refrigerated ""dollies"" that would do the transporting from hangars to planes. It now has 20, so several freighters can be loaded at the same time. Fraport was not the only one upping investments in solutions to keep things cool. As it became clear that BioNTech's vaccine would need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) the expertise of cold chain management became the next hot commodity in town. Amid the global scramble to solve the problem of keeping vaccines at the right temperature as they get transported across the world, it would appear that there is a German company for every obscure application. Binder in Tuttlingen has its ""super freezers"" which were already tapped as early as March to chill coronaviruses used in laboratory research by BioNTech and another German vaccine developer, CureVac. But demand further grew as BioNTech advanced in the race. ""It started really in August, when we received these requests from logistics companies... they knew we must fit our cold storage... with freezers in order to distribute the vaccines around the world,"" said Binder spokeswoman Anne Lenze. While Binder ensured static refrigeration of up to minus 90 degrees, another company Va-Q-Tec makes moving boxes with an ultra-cool function for the actual transportation process. Using a silica particle technology, the containers can maintain temperatures ranging from one similar to a fridge to polar chills for up to 10 days ""without the need for energy input"", chief executive Joachim Kuhn told AFP. On November 18, BioNTech and its partner Pfizer finally announced that their Phase III study showed around 90 percent efficacy against the virus. The news sent stock markets into euphoria and was hailed as a watershed, a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel. By then, the logistics sector was raring to go. As Fraport's Conrady put it: ""We've been ready since August."" Celebrating in their understated manner, BioNTech's founders knew it was too early to rest on their laurels. ""Champagne is not our thing. We sat down and enjoyed a cup of tea and used the time to reflect on what had happened so far and what will come next,"" Sahin told AFP. Several hundred kilometres away in the German capital, 66-year-old Albrecht Broemme was placing a bunch of Lego figurines here and there as he visualised how to transform Berlin's old airports into centres for the unprecedented vaccination drive. An ex-firefighter and former head of civil protection agency THW, Broemme had been called out of retirement to help in the pandemic battle. Early on, he was pivotal in designing emergency sites in case patient numbers were to soar above hospital capacities. In the autumn, he was tapped again to conceptualise the vaccination drive for the German capital. ""I came up with a system, thinking about how many (vaccination) booths we would need and how much space we would need in order to prevent bottlenecks,"" he said. Each visitor will follow a designated route from registration to the actual jab, then on to a consultation with a doctor and finally to a waiting room while final checks are performed. The patient should be in and out of the doctor's cubicle in a few minutes, Broemme said. Including the queueing and waiting time, ""we imagine that all of this will take an hour."" On December 2, BioNTech's vaccine became the first to get the go-ahead for use in the West, when Britain gave its approval. As other nations from the United States to Saudi Arabia to Singapore followed suit, Germany impatiently prodded the EU's drugs regulator to bring forward its decision from December 29. The EMA finally gave its greenlight more than a week early, on December 21. On the same night, the European Commission declared that the entire bloc would start the inoculation operation from Sunday, December 27. With the first jabs imminent, officials raced to put the finishing touches on the makeshift inoculation centres across Germany. At the country's biggest in Hamburg, doctors will be able to handle 7,000 daily jabs. BioNTech has also held webinars for nurses and doctors who will soon administer the shot, with 1,100 questions answered during the sessions. Lorries carrying vaccines rolled out from Pfizer's factory in Belgium on Wednesday. BioNTech said it would directly supply its vaccines to 25 distribution sites manned by federal authorities in Germany which would then send along the allocations to 294 districts. Local authorities will then further funnel the jabs down to 450 vaccination centres. A slew of mobile units will also be deployed to harder to reach districts. With an eye on potential sabotage by a growing wave of corona skeptics and anti-vaxxers, federal police with armed commando units are escorting the precious cargo on the move. First up will be the most vulnerable in elderly homes, several of which have been hit by deadly outbreaks of the virus. The inoculations could not come soon enough for Germany, which registered record high daily death tolls of nearly 1,000 people during the week. At least one district has reported that its crematorium is full. For Chancellor Angela Merkel, every jab means a life saved. ""When we see how many people are dying because of coronavirus, we can see how many lives the vaccine can save."" "
"BERLIN: Long held up as a European success story in the fight against the pandemic, Germany has been hit hard by a second coronavirus wave that has brought record daily infection numbers and deaths. With intensive care beds filling up and Germans heading into the Christmas holidays under a partial lockdown, here's a look at what went wrong. Chancellor Angela Merkel, a scientist, won plaudits during the first wave in the spring for giving Germans clear and fact-based guidance on Covid-19. Close cooperation with the regional leaders of Germany's 16 states allowed for early and widespread testing and quick action against local outbreaks. But the country's federal system later turned against Merkel. At a crucial meeting in October, she pleaded in vain for tough new curbs to fight rapidly rising infection numbers. Many regional leaders, wary of inflicting more financial pain on businesses and nervous about an increasingly vocal anti-mask movement, opposed Merkel and a confusing patchwork of rules emerged. Merkel at the time declared herself ""unsatisfied"" but had no power to push through nationwide measures. As other European countries returned to hard lockdowns, German leaders eventually agreed on a four-week ""light"" shutdown for November, which kept schools and shops open but closed indoor dining, leisure and cultural centres -- to little effect. ""It was probably the biggest political miscalculation of the year,"" Der Spiegel weekly said. Crisis talks between Merkel and the regions saw Germany return to a partial lockdown on Wednesday, shutting schools and non-essential shops in addition to the existing restrictions, until at least January 10. Although sometimes gently mocked abroad as sticklers for the rules, not all Germans are showing the same commitment to mask-wearing and social distancing as at the start of the pandemic. When Christmas markets were cancelled to limit socialising, mulled wine stands popped up that drew large crowds, much to Merkel's dismay. ""During the spring lockdown, we reduced our contacts by 63 percent. Right now, we've only managed 43 percent, which simply isn't enough,"" Christian Drosten, one of Germany's best-known coronavirus experts, said recently. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for disease control has said Germans need to reduce their social contacts by at least 60 percent to bring transmission rates back down to a level where contact tracers can keep up with the chain of infection. The country's coronavirus warning app has been downloaded 23.5 million times. But only around half of users who have tested positive have actually used the app's notification feature. The worst-hit coronavirus states at the moment are in Germany's former communist East, which also happens to be where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has the most support. Among them are the districts of Bautzen and Goerlitz in Saxony state, where coronavirus incidence rates now stand at 600 per 100,000 people -- more than three times the national rate. The AfD has in recent months railed against the virus curbs and its members have joined a series of ""anti-corona"" demos, marching with anti-maskers, conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccination campaigners. After initially condemning the ""hysteria"" about surging infection numbers, Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer admitted he ""underestimated"" the virus and ordered his state into a partial lockdown two days before the rest of Germany. The head of the RKI, Lothar Wieler, has voiced concern about the rising number of cases and deaths in homes for the elderly. In the capital Berlin alone, the number of pensioners testing positive for the virus has more than doubled since mid-November, to over 2,000 cases. Of the more than 24,000 Covid-19 deaths recorded in Germany so far, 87 percent were people aged 69 or over, according to the Statista data agency. Nursing and care homes nationwide have sounded the alarm about a lack of personnel, which they say makes it hard to quickly test and isolate elderly people and their carers. Many also complain about a lack of high-efficiency FFP2 and FFP3 masks at work. Merkel's government has pledged to provide free FFP2 masks to senior citizens and carers. "
"FRANKFURT: Germany will close most stores from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10, cutting short the busy Christmas shopping season, as it tightens coronavirus restrictions and tries to rein in the spread of the disease, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday. ""I would have wished for lighter measures. But due to Christmas shopping the number of social contacts has risen considerably,"" Merkel told journalists following a meeting with leaders of the country's 16 federal states. ""There is an urgent need to take action,"" she said. Only essential shops such as supermarkets and pharmacies, as well as banks, are to remain open from Dec. 16. Hair salons, beauty salons and tattoo parlours will also have to shut. The government will support affected companies with a total of around 11 billion euros ($13.3 billion) a month. Businesses that are forced to close may receive up to 90% of fixed costs, or up 500,000 euros a month, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said. Schools will be closed in principle, and employers are asked to close operations or have employees work from home. The sale of fireworks will be banned ahead of New Year's Eve. Germany has been in partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed, while stores and schools have remained open. Some regions have already imposed tougher measures as infections grew. ""'Lockdown light' has had an impact, but it was not sufficient,"" Bavaria's prime minister Markus Soeder said. ""The situation is out of control."" Private gatherings will remain limited to no more than five people from two households. For the Christmas holidays, the rule will be eased slightly so that families can celebrate together. Merkel and Soeder said it was too soon to say whether the economy could re-open after Jan. 10. New daily infections and deaths have reached records in recent days, and more politicians have been sounding the alarm. Germany, Europe's largest economy, was more successful than many European countries in keeping the pandemic under control in the first wave in March and April. But it has been struggling to turn the tide in the second wave. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 20,200 to 1,320,716, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 321 to 21,787, the tally showed. "
"BERLIN: Germany's trend of new infections has taken a worrying turn, the head of its disease control agency said Thursday, as the death toll to date crossed the grim milestone of 20,000. ""The rise in numbers is worrying,"" said Robert Koch Institute president Lothar Wieler, warning that after plateauing for a few weeks, ""the course of infections could tip over again"" into exponential growth. Germany would have to introduce tougher curbs to break the trend, he said. ""Other measures must be considered. If (current measures) are not working, then I don't see any other possibilities."" Germany ordered a new round of shutdowns in November, closing cultural and leisure facilities as well as banning indoor dining. Health officials had in mid-November credited the measures with halting exponential growth in infections. But Chancellor Angela Merkel herself has demanded tougher restrictions as transmissions began ticking up again after daily new infections held steady at around 20,000 for several weeks. On Thursday, cases recorded over the last 24 hours reached 23,679, while the daily death toll came to 440. Alarmingly, Wieler said there is currently twice as many outbreaks in elderly and care homes than in August. He acknowledged that people are increasingly tired of keeping to measures be it mask wearing or limiting social contacts, and that compliance was now an issue. But the RKI president urged Germans to turn the situation around. ""We are not powerless before this virus. We have a good strategy,"" he said. In a hard-hitting speech before the Bundestag on Wednesday, Merkel issued a stark warning to Germans ahead of the Christmas holiday season when families are expected to gather. ""If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we'd really have failed,"" she said. "
"NEW DELHI: People flying under the air bubble from India to Germany will now require to undergo Covid test on arrival. Germany has decided to conduct this test on arrivals from a long list of âhigh riskâ areas/countries that includes the US, Qatar, Philippines and Luxembourg. The US, which has the worldâs highest number of Covid positive cases, on Thursday lifted the advisory asking its citizens to avoid international travel due to the pandemic. India is on the long list of countries that includes Russia, China, Mexico and Iran which currently and still have a level-4 âdo not travelâ advisory for US citizens. Germanyâs public health agency, Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said in a statement: âThe countries listed are designated as currently presenting an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2â¦. The government examines, on an ongoing basis, the extent to which areas are to be classified as risk areas. As a result, this list can be modified at short notice and, above all, may be extended.â The US State Department tweeted: âWe have lifted the Global Level 4 Health Advisory, which advised Americans to avoid international travel due to COVID-19. We are returning to country-specific levels of travel advice (Levels 1-4), so that travellers can make informed travel decisions.â âDo not travel to India due to COVID-19,â Americaâs travel advisory for India says. Level 3 is âreconsider travelâ that includes Canada, Qatar, Philippines and Singapore. Level 2 is âexercise increased cautionâ that includes Mauritius and Thailand. Level 1 is âexercise normal precautionsâ that includes Taiwan and Macau. Given the way the virus is behaving, the US State Department adds âthat conditions can change rapidly in a country at any time.â "
"BERLIN: Germany has recorded more than 5,000 daily new coronavirus infections for the first time since April, giving fresh urgency to crisis talks about the pandemic between chancellor Angela Merkel and the 16 states' premiers in Berlin on Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases increased by 5,132 to 334,585 on Tuesday, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed. The reported death toll rose by 43. Most of Germany's states have agreed that residents of coronavirus risk areas in their states should not be allowed to stay in hotels in other parts of the country to curb the surge in cases. But opposition has grown in recent days, in particular as the autumn school holidays have started in many states. Armin Laschet, the premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, hopes that state leaders will agree on a ""pragmatic solution"" in Berlin as it was most important to focus on fighting the virus, he told TV station ARD on Wednesday. Regional solutions in response to local outbreaks have been Germany's strengths so far, Laschet said. But as the number of areas that exceed the critical case load of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants over seven consecutive days is growing, ""we need unified rules"". ""The more clarity there is in the important things, the more one can differentiate locally when there are different occurrences,"" Laschet said. The premier of Bavaria, Markus Soeder, also called for nationwide rules on Tuesday, warning that the next four weeks would be crucial for whether Germans could celebrate a relaxed Christmas. Meanwhile the German government is preparing new support measures for companies that have been hit hard by the pandemic such as the hotel and catering sector, including an extension of bridge loan facilities by six months, according to a report by Funke Mediengruppe.

"COLOGNE (GERMANY): Germany twice had to come from behind to earn a rollercoaster 3-3 draw against visitors Switzerland in an exciting Nations League group game packed with incident on Tuesday. The result moves Germany within a point of League A Group Four leaders Spain, who lost 1-0 away to Ukraine, while the Swiss, who are still without a win, remain bottom. The visitors stunned Germany with Mario Gavranovic's fifth minute header and doubled the lead in the 26th when they intercepted a pass from Toni Kroos, in his 100th international, and Remo Freuler beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a cool chip. Timo Werner hit back for the hosts two minutes later, wrongfooting keeper Yann Sommer with a clever low shot, as the Germans maintained possession and kept pushing forward. Robin Gosens' effort was tipped over the bar by Sommer late in the first half but the keeper was beaten when Kai Havertz charged into the box and fired home the equaliser in the 55th. Germany coach Joachim Loew reverted to a four-man defence for the game but it kept leaking goals as the Swiss went back in front in the 57th after Neuer made consecutive saves from Haris Seferovic before Gavranovic pounced to drill in on the rebound. A sensational Serge Gnabry back heel flick on the hour pulled the home side level once more and the Swiss then finished the match with 10 men following the stoppage-time dismissal of defender Fabian Schaer for a second booking.

"MELBOURNE: Alexander Zverev shrugged off a tight loss to Novak Djokovic to end Serbia's ATP Cup title defence with victory in the doubles as Germany advanced to the semi-finals of the team-based event in Melbourne on Friday. Germany will meet Russia in the last four, with Spain to take on Italy. Zverev, beaten 6-7(3) 6-2 7-5 in a high-quality match by world number one Djokovic earlier on Friday, stepped up to partner Jan-Lennard Struff to a rousing 7-6(4) 5-7 (10-7) victory over Djokovic and Nikola Cacic on Rod Laver Arena. ""I was quite frustrated with how the singles ended in a way,"" Zverev said on court. ""Still got to give myself some time. ""We played well, both of us,"" he added of his doubles match with Struff, who beat Dusan Lajovic 3-6 6-3 6-4 in the opening singles rubber. Djokovic's 11-match winning streak in the team tournament was broken, and he will have no more match practice before his Australian Open title defence. ""I am upset that we lost, that's all I can say, I'm not thinking about the Australian Open or anything else,"" said Djokovic. A year after crashing out of the inaugural ATP Cup with a huge tally of double-faults, Zverev's serving demons returned under pressure against Djokovic in the singles and again in the doubles on Friday. He was broken at 5-5 in the second set of the doubles after two double-faults but nailed his serves when Germany grabbed match points in the super tiebreak. Djokovic consoled himself that he had an excellent warmup against Zverev in the singles. ""I thought it was a great match. I thought we both played well ... He definitely had a big serving match. It was so difficult to play against him today,"" he said. With Rafa Nadal still sidelined with a back problem, Pablo Carrena Busta guided a depleted Spain into the last four by claiming a 6-3 6-4 win against Greeceâs Michail Pervolarakis at John Cain Arena. Though eliminated, Greece ended up winning the tie 2-1, with Stefanos Tsitsipas easing past Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5 7-5. Spain retired after losing the opening game of the doubles, handing Greece the win. "
"BERLIN: Liverpool have been barred from entering Germany for a Champions League match against RB Leipzig on February 16 because of strict entry rules imposed because of the pandemic, the German interior ministry said Thursday. ""German federal police informed RB Leipzig today that the described case does not meet the requirements for an exception"" to the travel restrictions, the ministry said in a statement. UEFA's regulations decree that Leipzig must find a way of hosting the last-16, first leg match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat, but the planning for the match has been upended by Germany's updated travel restrictions. RB Leipzig CEO Oliver Mintzlaff said the club would find an alternative location for the match. ""We are in talks and we are working on a solution. We will play somewhere,"" he told AFP's German sport subsidiary SID. The new German rules, slated to last until the day after the game, ban travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious, coronavirus variants such as Britain. Though there are some exceptions for medical workers and others in key professions, the interior ministry has repeatedly said that there are ""no special provision for professional sportspeople"". Potential solutions include playing the game in another country, or switching the home and away legs of the tie so that the first leg would be in Liverpool. Leipzig, who reached the semi-finals of the competition last season, are scheduled to travel to Liverpool for the second leg, to be played behind closed doors like all top-level matches in Europe, on March 10. It is not clear if Leipzig's sister club RB Salzburg could host the February 16 game at their Red Bull Arena. The Austrian side will play Spanish club Villarreal there in a Europa League game on two days later. ""The Europa League has a different branding from the Champions League. So the stadium must be prepared two days before and the turf must be in top condition,"" Salzburg's media spokesman Christian Kircher told German newspaper Passauer Neue Presse. The decision also places a question mark over another Champions League last-16 match, between Borussia Moenchengladbach against Manchester City which is due to be played in Germany on February 24. The Champions League, Europe's top club competition, was heavily disrupted by the pandemic last season. It was placed on hold when sport across Europe was halted in March. UEFA then took the decision to complete the competition as a 'Final Eight' tournament in Lisbon in August, without spectators. Bayern Munich beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the final. "
"BERLIN: Joachim Loew will remain in charge of Germany for next year's delayed European Championship despite a series of poor recent results, the German football federation (DFB) announced Monday. ""The presidential committee of the DFB decided unanimously this Monday during a teleconference to continue with coach Joachim Loew on the difficult path of renewal started in March 2019,"" the DFB said in a statement, following a meeting with Loew and the federation's top officials. Loew, 60, has been in charge of the Germany team since taking over from Jurgen Klinsmann following the 2006 World Cup. He led the nation to a fourth world title, and first since reunification, in Brazil in 2014 when the Germans defeated Lionel Messi's Argentina in the final. However, Germany are in crisis following a 6-0 defeat to Spain on November 17 and recent draws with Switzerland, twice, and Turkey. The recent hammering by Spain, Germany's heaviest loss in 89 years, capped a poor three-year spell, which included an embarrassing group-stage exit at the 2018 World Cup in Russia after which the DFB gave Loew their backing. Loew has made some controversial decisions since the debacle in Russia, none more so than the one to end the international careers of World Cup winners Thomas Mueller, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels. The DFB's 14-member presidential committee had initially been due to meet Friday to determine Loew's fate. However, the group brought its decision forward, aligning itself with the views of the ""management committee and national team director Oliver Bierhoff"", the DFB added. ""During this meeting, Joachim Loew informed the participants of his analysis, his ideas and his projects,"" the statement continued. ""The members of the management committee unanimously concluded that the high-quality work of the coaching staff, the sound relationship between the coach and the team, and a clear idea of the course followed so far and to come were valid arguments."" It added: ""A one-off match cannot and must not be used as a measure for the overall performance of the national team and coach. ""Our eyes must remain fixed on the preparations for the Euros next year. We have the firm conviction that Joachim Loew and his staff will succeed... despite a difficult situation for everyone."" While Loew is under contract until the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, his position could again come under scrutiny at the Euros, which were postponed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Germany have been drawn in a tough group at the finals with defending champions Portugal, World Cup holders France and Hungary. "
"MUNICH: A year after Germany's first Covid-19 patient was admitted to a Munich hospital, its exhausted doctors say the fight against the virus is far from over, despite a recent decline in cases. ""The situation is easing up a bit but our teams are tired and the virus hasn't disappeared yet,"" said Clemens Wendtner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Munich Clinic (MMHG). The MMHG's hospital in Schwabing, northern Munich, treated Germany's patient zero -- an employee of the electromobility company Webasto who got infected at a training session led by a Chinese colleague. A year on, what was then an epidemic is today a raging pandemic that has claimed more than 57,000 lives in Germany alone and infected more than two million. For Wendtner, it simply means: ""It is far too early to ease restrictions. We have to remain disciplined."" At an intensive care unit in the nearby Rechts der Isar Hospital, it has been a rollercoaster ride. After an explosion in new cases before Christmas, the numbers are slowly starting to stabilise again. For the hospital, re-establishing a non-Covid zone after several weeks has felt like a small victory. A plexiglass screen in the corridor of the intensive care unit marks the dividing line between coronavirus patients and those with other ailments, a red stop sign warning staff not to proceed without protective equipment. ""Now we can take in non-Covid patients again,"" said doctor Markus Heim. In December, amid a surge in the number of cases in Germany, the unit's 21 beds were entirely given over to critical Covid-19 patients. ""It was a very tense situation,"" said Heim. Germany renewed restrictions in November, shutting down bars and restaurants as well as culture and leisure facilities. Measures were tightened further in December, with schools and non-essential shops also ordered to close. The current shutdowns are set to last at least until mid-February. The state of Bavaria has gone further than the national measures, by also ordering a nightly curfew from 9 pm. Weeks into the restrictions, German leaders have cautiously voiced optimism as infection numbers are coming down. There were 4,322 Covid patients in intensive care across the country on Monday, according to the DIVI emergency medicine association -- down from around 5,700 in early January. Nevertheless, the situation remains critical for many. Late last month, three patients were being treated in Rechts der Isar Hospital's Covid-19 section. One of them is a man in his forties, unconscious, hooked up to countless tubes and machines, under the constant watchful eye of medical staff. On his bedside table is a picture of his family, smiling. His chances of survival are not much better than they would have been a year ago: according to Heim, about a third of Covid-19 patients brought to this unit will die. The doctor is still shocked by ""what this virus can do to healthy people"". ""There is still a lot we don't know about this virus,"" the 44-year-old said. Intensive care nurse Monika Schubka, 49, gets through the bad times by ""talking to family, friends and colleagues"". After months of caring for Covid-19 patients, she is no longer afraid of getting infected herself. ""We are well equipped, well protected. During the first wave, I was a bit worried, I was afraid of infecting my family, but not any more,"" the mother of two said. Before stepping into the room of a Covid-19 patient, staff must be wrapped up in a plastic head covering, visor, mask, surgical gown and gloves. Hospital staff have a clear message for those keen on easing the restrictions. ""We all wish we could do the things we miss, like hugging our parents,"" said Schubka, who hasn't seen her mother and father since November. But ""we have a long road ahead of us and a long way to go,"" she believes. Schubka is clinging to the hope of celebrating her birthday in April with family and a few friends, if the situation allows. The first wave poured cold water on her birthday celebrations last year, but she is hopeful that it will be possible to celebrate her 50th in some kind of style. "
"NEW DELHI: An Olympic gold medallist and a doctor rolled into one, Germany's hockey ace Martin Haner never stopped 'defending' even when sports came to a halt for close to six months. The difference was that instead of a hockey stick in hand against the converging opposition players, he wielded the stethoscope in his country's fight against the coronavirus. In European sports culture, players don't compromise on academics for sports, maybe because the game is not as professional as it has lately become in India -- which is why reaching the level Haner has attained becomes harder and therefore more commendable. But what he encountered over the last five months, when he switched from the operation theatre as an orthopedic surgeon to the intensive care unit, was unprecedented for medical professionals world over. Having said that, watching the pandemic unfold from close quarters, Haner is proud that Germany reacted in a better way compared to the other countries. Last month, the 32-year-old Haner took his doctor's coat off to wear his Germany jersey when international hockey made a return after a 199-day break because of the pandemic. The Germans hosted world champions Belgium for a two-match FIH Pro League tie in Dusseldorf. Germany were trounced 1-6 in the opening match, while they managed a shootout win in the second after holding the Red Lions to a 1-1 draw in the regulation period. Haner admits that he was both excited and a little apprehensive to play while the Covid-19 pandemic remains prevalent, and the doctor stuck his neck out to admit that travelling longer distances to play hockey presents a greater ""risk of infection"". The Berliner HC defender, though, is looking forward to the Olympics in 2021, for which he has extended his hockey career by a year. (Haner, with possibly face-mask marks visible under his eyes, earned his 250th international cap in Game 1 vs Belgium - Honamas Facebook Photo)In an exclusive interview with Timesofindia.com, the German veteran opened up both as a doctor and as a player in these unprecedented times. Excerpts...Germany and Belgium were the first teams to resume international hockey while the coronavirus is still a pandemic. Take us through all that went into getting the team back together again to train and then those two match-days after months.It was a strange feeling to get back together with the national team after such a long time. We haven't had any training sessions together since February. Before we met, of course, all the players and staff were tested for Covid-19 (all were negative). We were very isolated in the hotel and had our own hotel corridor. There were clear agreements on hygiene and we were only allowed to leave the hotel to play hockey. Before the matches against Belgium took place, we were tested again 48 hours before the game (all negative) and the games were played without spectators. Since we are still in the middle of the pandemic, it was a strange feeling; but on the other hand, it was also nice to be able to play international matches again after such a long time. Was there still some fear somewhere in the back of the players' minds? Our medical department and our manager have made all the arrangements for our training camp and informed us about all the special features, so that we as experienced players did not have to take any fears. Everything was very well planned and luckily there were no positive cases. You are a doctor as well. How do you analyse the return of sports, especially international hockey, amid this pandemic? Does the virus still pose serious threats to sportspersons?I think this question has to be viewed in a very differentiated way. Outdoor sports do not seem to be a particularly high risk of Covid-19 infection. But longer trips are necessary both in the German Bundesliga and even more so in international tournaments. The risk of infection is certainly much greater. Of course, as a doctor and a family man, I have in the back of my mind that I can infect myself and then possibly infect other people. That's why we try to adhere to all the guidelines wherever possible, but I am very skeptical about long journeys in the current situation (Haner in Game 1 vs Belgium - FIH Facebook Photo)Coming to the matches against Belgium, your team turned it around after a below-par outing in the first match to salvage a fighting draw in the second, before winning it in the shootout. How satisfying were your first competitive days in almost six months?It was very nice, but the euphoria was still subdued for me because unfortunately the end of the pandemic is not yet in sight and we don't know how long we can play. In the first game against Belgium, we played three of four quarters well, and the result (1-6) certainly doesn't reflect the game. But, of course, it was nice to end our first trip together in the second game with a win after shootout. The Pro League is going to run up to the door of the Olympics in Tokyo. What are Germany's plans, who have slipped out of the top five in FIH rankings?At the moment, the world ranking is certainly not our main focus. We want to try and prepare as best we can for the Olympic Games next year under the current circumstances, and the Pro League is, of course, extremely important in development, as you are only challenged there against the best teams in the world. There were some talks around you ending your hockey career but I read somewhere that you may extend it by an year to play the Tokyo Games. What's your current state of mind on that?My plan was to end my hockey career after the Olympics and concentrate fully on my family and my job as a doctor. As a result of the postponement, everything has now shifted by a year and I thought for a long time whether I should continue. After talking to my wife and my boss at work, I received their support in doing sports for another year, for which I am very grateful. Going back a few months, how did your life as an orthopedic surgeon change during these times of a viral pandemic that required almost all the doctors to attend to Covid-19 patients?I work as an orthopedist in an operational area. Due to Covid-19, non-vital operations were banned, so that all of a sudden this was completely eliminated. Then I switched to the intensive care unit. Fortunately, we in Germany have the situation under control relatively well compared to other countries, and we never had more than 5-6 Covid-19 patients in our intensive care unit. But, of course, it was and is a completely different area of activity (in my medical profession) than usual. Did your experience as a sportsperson help you deal with the state of unprecedented emergency inside the ICU?To be honest, it was never as bad in our clinic as when you watched pictures from Italy or Spain on the television. We were very well prepared. "
"DÃSSELDORF (Germany): Britain's 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith picked up her second indoor victory over 60m in Germany this weekend by winning the women's final in Duesseldorf on Sunday. Having equalled her personal best by running 7.08 seconds to claim victory in Karlsruhe on Friday, the 25-year-old clocked 7.12 to win the women's 60m final on Sunday. This weekend is the first time the British sprint queen has raced indoors for three years and her first race for well over a year. Less than six months before the Tokyo Olympics get underway, Asher-Smith dominated the field at the Duesseldorf meet held behind closed doors due to the coronavirus. The 25-year-old finished ahead of Swiss sprinter Ajla del Ponte, who ran a personal best 7.16secs. Asher-Smith is also set to race in Lievin on February 9. She could also feature at the European Indoor Championships in Turon, Poland, from March 5-7, for which she has already qualified. "
"BERLIN: Germany on Friday saw its total number of coronavirus infections pass one million, the Robert Koch Institute for disease control said. The institute recorded more than 22,000 new daily cases, pushing the country's total beyond the one million mark. Germany had largely contained the spread of the virus in the spring but has been hit hard by a second wave of infections. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care nationwide has soared from just over 360 in early October to more than 3,500 last week. Most populous North Rhine-Westphalia state has recorded more than a quarter of all cases, ahead of Bavaria's 198,000 confirmed infections. Berlin has seen 62,000 cases since the start of the pandemic. Chancellor Angela Merkel this week announced that Germany was extending its current coronavirus restrictions through to early January unless there is a dramatic drop in infections. Rules will ease over the festive period to accommodate Christmas and New Year celebrations, allowing meetings of up to 10 adults from December 23 to New Year's Day. Europe's biggest economy has shuttered restaurants, bars, sporting facilities and cultural venues, though schools and shops remain open. "
"PARIS: The minimum wage, which US President Joe Biden aims to raise to $15 per hour in the United States, can take different forms in different countries. Here is how it works in Japan, Germany, Britain and France. Japan has a range of different minimum wages. Each of the country's 47 prefectures sets its own, taking into account the results of annual national negotiations between representatives of employers, employees and the labour ministry. There are also specific minimum wages for certain sectors in each prefecture, such as the manufacture of auto parts. The minimum wages are higher in urbanised areas. The highest is in Tokyo at 1,013 yen ($9.68, 7.98 euros) per hour. The lowest is 792 yen in rural areas such as the northern prefecture of Akita or Okinawa in the southeast. According to the labour ministry, 1.9 percent of employees are paid the minimum wage or less (there are exceptions) in companies with at least five employees. The minimum wage was raised by just 1 yen at the start of the current fiscal year on April 1, the smallest hike in 16 years. The previous four years it was increased by more than 20 yen as governments tried to boost domestic consumption and, indirectly, chronically low inflation. Following intense debate, Germany introduced a national minimum wage on January 1, 2015. A special commission, the Mindestlohnkommission, made up of representatives of employers and trade unions and headed by an independent president, is responsible for reviewing it. At 9.50 euros ($11.50) per hour before taxes, it is relatively low compared to other European countries, and the commission has recommended it be hiked gradually to 10.45 euros ($12.70) by July 1, 2022. Much of the debate about the introduction of the minimum wage focussed on whether it would lead employers to cut jobs. A study published in January 2021 by the Research Institute for the Future of Work found that the minimum wage had not led to an increase in unemployment. It found that that small and medium-sized companies had actually transformed temporary jobs into permanent ones. The IW think-tank, which is close to employers, found last year that the minimum wage had little effect on the risk of falling into poverty (defined as income less than 60 percent of the median), mostly because most minimum wage workers have other sources of income, such as that of a partner. On the contrary, part-time work, which is common in Germany, was linked to a higher risk of poverty. In Britain, the minimum wage, or National Living Wage, was created in its current form in 2016. Any increases are decided by the government on the recommendation of the independent Low Pay Commission. The objective in creating the new system was to increase the minimum wage to the level of 60 percent of the median wage by 2020, a goal which has been achieved according to a government commission. The hourly minimum wage for employees over the age of 25 was hiked by 6.2 percent on April 1, 2020 to Â£8.72 ($11.98, 9.86 euros). Depending on the employee's age, it can fall as low as Â£4.15 ($5.69, 4.69 euros) for apprentices under 16. About two million Britons are expected to benefit from an increase in the minimum wage to Â£8.91 ($12.21, 10.06 euros) coming into effect in April, and the age of people receiving it has been lowered from 25 to 23. While there is currently no public debate on the minimum wage, there is much discussion about a minimum income for those on unemployment benefits or others with low incomes. France's minimum wage, or Smic, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2020. Since 2008 it has been recalculated automatically each year based on inflation and purchasing power. In January, it was increased by just under one percent to 10.25 euros ($12.45) per hour before taxes. Some 2.25 million workers, or 13 percent of the private-sector workforce, benefitted from a 1.2-percent increase in the Smic at the beginning of 2020. The proportion of people receiving the minimum wage is three times higher for those in part-time work or employed in small companies, compared to the average of nine percent for employees on full-time contracts. Every year, a number of trade unions call on the government to raise the minimum wage by a greater amount than the automatic increase in order to give a ""helping hand"" to low-income workers. However, the last time that happened was in 2012, as governments were concerned that bigger hikes would harm the job prospects of low-qualified workers. Instead, the French government introduced a bonus for those earning the minimum wage, which was last raised to 90 euros ($109) per month at the end of 2019. Some 4.3 million households received the bonus at the end of 2019. At the same time, the government has reduced the social charges for companies employing low-paid workers, which has helped increase the attractiveness of employing workers in France. "
"BERLIN: Germany is marking the 30th anniversary of its reunification on Saturday, drawing a generally positive picture of the progress made in knitting together east and west amid celebrations that are low-key because of the coronavirus pandemic. Germany was reunited on October 3, 1990, after four decades of Cold War division. East Germany joined the western federal republic less than a year after the east's communist rulers â under pressure from growing protests â opened the Berlin Wall and the rest of the highly fortified border between the two states. While much progress has been made since then, economic and other differences between the west and the less-prosperous east still persist. A long-lasting trend of more people leaving the east than moving there has finally halted in recent years. âWe have achieved a lot in these 30 years,â Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in the east, told Germany's parliament this week. âWe have succeeded in significantly reducing the differences in living conditions between eastern and western Germany."" âBut structural differences remain,â she added. âFurther efforts are necessary.â The centerpiece of Saturday's celebrations is a ceremony in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, led by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, with 230 guests â about one-fifth of the audience originally planned. Merkel acknowledged that the celebrations âwill be quieter than the occasion would actually deserve.â "
"NEW DELHI: In December 2018, when Belgium broke Dutch hearts to win the men's hockey World Cup, a 'blueprint to success' reached its final destination. But from thereon, the Red Lions' task became tougher, for they had to not just enjoy the view from the top but also keep proving that they belong there. The next goal on that road for the Belgians is to turn their 2016 Olympic silver to gold in Tokyo next year. But the preparation has been far from ideal, so far. After enjoying a year as the new world champions, the Belgians, along with the rest of the hockey world, had to go through a difficult period. The pandemic forced the Olympics to be moved to 2021 and the eerily quiet hockey pitches around the world had no activity for close to 200 days. Hockey had its line-up of the 12 teams for the Tokyo Games, the fixtures were rolled out as well, but the all-important practice provided by Pro League before the big stage had to be stopped indefinitely, as the pandemic wreaked havoc. Finally in September, as the world reached a stage where it had learned, to an extent, how to live with the coronavirus, international hockey returned, when Germany hosted Belgium in Dusseldorf for a two-match Pro League tie. The FIH, after much deliberation and outlining the SOP to be followed, decided to bring hockey back on the pitch, with Germany and Belgium becoming the first two teams to experience playing in the Covid-19 era. To know how it felt and what changed, Timesofindia.com got in touch with the coach of the Red Lions, Shane McLeod, for an exclusive interview. (Action from the second match between Germany and Belgium in Dusseldorf - FIH Facebook Photo )Excerpts... Is it an advantage or a disadvantage to be the first team to play with Covid-19 restrictions in place?I believe that there are some positives with being (among) the first teams to play. Firstly, we get to start to develop our game earlier than other nations that are still either in training mode or not able to be together. We also create the expectation of a new normal for the group. Athletes need to have targets to look forward to and there is no better way to do this than playing other nations. How many days before the matches against Germany did you get together as a group? Did you have a camp?We are lucky to be able to operate in a semi-centralised programme, meaning that players are able to live at home but can come into the training environment each week for training. This means that the need to bring the group together before playing a match does not need to be for a long period. We travelled the morning before we played, as it is only a two-hour distance from where we train. How much does being in a camp help as opposed to getting together just a few days before a tour/tournament? What do you prefer as a coach? In normal circumstances, we would travel a week to ten days before a tournament so that we get used to the time zone, conditions and climate; but for the Pro League, this is not practical. When we do travel and are in camp, it is a great way to bring the group to another level, playing-wise, and also as a team. #FIHProLeague #HockeyInvites #GERvBEL @BELRedLions' LoÃ¯ck Luypaert reflects on the important learnings from the 2â¦ https://t.co/EPCR1G33SS— International Hockey Federation (@FIH_Hockey) 1600926070000Talking about the lockdown period in one of your earlier comments, you said, the ""players' technical levels are very high...and some even made gains"". Can you please elaborate on that?Due to the fact that we had to train over distances, we needed to be creative in how we set out our training. It meant going back to basics and working on areas of players' development that often get overlooked. For example, training to receive overheads was an easy topic to develop. Players would do hundreds of repeatable exercises rather than 10 or 20. This means that players' skill levels improved. How much does not playing together for a long time matter, especially when you have largely played with more or less the same group over a period of time, which helped you win the World Cup as well?We have actually enlarged our group for a short period of time. We are starting to shape a group ready to prepare for the next Olympic cycle. We had two new players playing (for) their first caps for the Red Lions against Germany. For most nations, it takes some time to piece together the team's playing style and after seven months we also have to start to build each of the areas of our game. What makes this an interesting exercise is that players are back with their clubs, meaning that they are having to learn several playing styles all at the same time. Talking about the Covid-19 protocols related to match-days, what struck you the most when you stepped on the pitch?For me, a big part of the experience is the crowd. Whether you are playing against India in India and having to deal with the crowd's ability to lift the team, or playing at home in Belgium knowing that all of the supporters have come to enjoy the event, it is the crowd that provides that extra feeling. Without a crowd, it is very hard to not get the feeling of it being a training match. It just shows that we are social creatures. https://t.co/l4hiKmuLeL EXCLUSIVE!We had two @BELRedLions stars discuss their yesterday's win over Germany.Downâ¦ https://t.co/ZdKeTOFop4— International Hockey Federation (@FIH_Hockey) 1600858798000What has been the players' feedback about how they feel playing after a five-month break?The players have loved getting back on the field together -- the whole experience of being away as a group and enjoying all of the things around playing international hockey again. You won the first game against Germany comprehensively but then were held to a 1-1 draw in the second. What changed?I think that playing two games back to back is an interesting experience. There are several things that impact on the scoreline. Firstly, when you win a game 6-1, you often struggle to look at the game in the same detail as you do if you are the team that loses. Germany did many things better in the second match, which made it harder for us to create opportunities. I would also suggest that the first game was closer than the scoreline indicated. We were the better team, but I think that 6-1 was not a fair indication of how the game was. You are now on the road to the Olympics. How do you plan to do even better in Tokyo than you did in Rio in 2016?We still have many stages to pass through to have our Olympic readiness. In each game, we will focus on improvements and by the time the Olympics begin, you will see a very strong Belgium side ready to take on some of the world's best teams. We cannot wait. "
"ANKARA: New Fenerbahce signing Mesut Ozil said on Wednesday he was at the club he loved but reiterated his commitment to not be available for the German national team, which he quit two years ago. Ozil was a key member of Germany's World Cup-winning side in 2014. He retired from the squad in 2018 amid a political debate in Germany about an influx of migrants and after backlash over a photograph taken with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, saying he faced ""racism and disrespect"" over his Turkish ancestry. The 32-year-old signed a 3-1/2 year deal with Turkish Super Lig club Fenerbahce on Wednesday, finalising his move to what he has called his boyhood club, after falling out of favour at his former club Arsenal. ""When I go down a path, I never turn back. I wish the German national team success, but I will never again play there,"" Ozil told reporters at his signing ceremony for Fenerbahce in Istanbul. The playmaker was among the highest-paid players at Arsenal, but had not featured since last March, despite having played a key role in ending the club's trophy drought, winning the FA Cup in his first season under Arsene Wenger. He was later marginalised under Wenger's replacement Unai Emery and his successor Mikel Arteta, who said Ozil's omission from the squad was for ""football reasons"". Ozil was not included in Arsenal's Premier League or Europa League squads this season. Ozil had long been linked with a move to Fenerbahce, and his eventual move was lauded by Turkish media as one of the most significant transfers by a Super Lig club in recent years. Fenerbahce sit second in the league after 20 games, two points off leaders and rivals Besiktas and Ozil said he was certain the club will be in contention to win the championship. ""I've played at big clubs before of course, but Fenerbahce is different for me. It's a club I love,"" Ozil said. ""I was a Fenerbahce fan before and always will be,"" he added. Fenerbahce Chairman Ali Koc, who was also in attendance, said the club managed to sign Ozil despite the financial woes it has experienced recently, adding the player's flexibility over payments - including a heavy cut in salary - helped the transfer process. ""The honeymoon is over, now the real work begins,"" Koc said. "
"BERLIN: Joachim Loew wants to select 17-year-old Bayern Munich midfielder Jamal Musiala -- who is also eligible to play for England -- in the senior Germany squad for World Cup qualifiers in March, according to a report. Magazine Sports Bild claims Loew plans to pick Stuttgart-born Musiala, who also qualifies for England having moved there as a child and made his debut for the English Under-21 side last November. The teenager, who turns 18 in late February, came through Chelsea's academy before joining European champions Bayern in 2019. Musiala's mother is German and he can opt for Germany as long as he does not play for the senior England side. Last month, Germany team director Oliver Bierhoff said they are tracking Musiala, who has scored three goals in 14 league appearances for Bayern this season, mostly as a replacement. The attacking midfielder showcased his talent with a superb long-range goal in last month's 3-3 draw in a top-of-the-table clash at home to RB Leipzig. If Musiala opts for Germany, he could feature in Loew's squad against Iceland, Romania and North Macedonia in 2022 World Cup qualifiers in late March. "
"FRANKFURT: Germany will become the first European Union country to start using the same experimental antibodies treatment credited with helping Donald Trump recover from Covid-19, health minister Jens Spahn said Sunday. The government has bought 200,000 doses for 400 million euros ($486 million),"" Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, working out at 2,000 euros per dose.  Patients will receive them free of charge, a health ministry spokeswoman told AFP.  Two different kinds of so-called monoclonal antibody therapies will be made available to university hospitals from the coming week, with Spahn saying Germany was ""the first country in the EU"" to deploy them in the fight against the pandemic.  Both treatments have been approved for emergency use in the United States but have yet to receive the green light from European regulators.  The ministry spokeswoman said Germany's national regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PIE), had determined that use of the drugs was ""in principle"" allowed on a case-by-case basis if doctors deemed it appropriate to prevent ""severe illness or hospitalisations among certain risk groups"".  Germany has purchased doses of US firm Regeneron's Casirivimab/Imdevimab antibody cocktail, as well US company Eli Lilly's Bamlanivimab antibody drug, she added.  Trump, who was briefly hospitalised with the coronavirus last October, was treated with Regeneron's therapy, before it had gained formal authorisation.  He later said the medicine did ""a fantastic job"".  Regeneron's version is a combination or ""cocktail"" of two lab-made antibodies: infection-fighting proteins that were developed to bind to the surface protein of the coronavirus to stop it from invading human cells.  Eli Lilly's therapy works in a similar way but uses a single synthetic antibody. ""They work like a passive vaccination. Administering these antibodies in the early stages can help high-risk patients avoid a more serious progression,"" Spahn told Bild.  Germany's decision to use the drugs before the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has authorised them comes at a time of growing frustration over a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines in the EU.  Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca have both said they would be delivering fewer doses to Europe than anticipated in the short term because of production problems.  The German government has said it nonetheless expects to be able to offer all Germans a jab by the end of August.  Although Germany, the EU's most populous nation and its biggest economy, coped relatively well with the first coronavirus wave last spring, it has been hit hard by a resurgence in cases in recent months.  The emergence of new, more contagious strains has added to concerns.  The country has recorded over two million cases since the start of the pandemic, and more than 50,000 deaths.  Schools, non-essential shops, culture and leisure facilities are closed until February 14 in a bid to slow the infection rate, while companies have been urged to allow staff to work from home whenever possible. "
"BERLIN: The number of people, who have died of the coronavirus in Germany, has risen by 859 to 50,642 within the past 24 hours, the Robert Koch Institute said on Friday. Within the same period of time, the number of confirmed cases in Germany has increased by 17,862 to 2,106,262. More than 1.7 million people have recovered since the start of the outbreak. The World Health Organisation declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11. To date, more than 97.4 million people have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, with over 2.08 million fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University. "
"MOSCOW: Moscow said on Friday it was expelling diplomats from Poland, Germany and Sweden for participating in unauthorised demonstrations in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the unspecified number of diplomats who ""took part in illegal protests were declared persona non grata"" and ""ordered to leave Russia in the near future."" "
"BERLIN: Germany will extend and strengthen the coronavirus-related restrictive measures until February 14, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. ""Today we held talks again and agreed to introduce new measures... We are doing this as a precautionary measure for the sake of citizens' health, as well as for the sake of the economy and labor market,"" Merkel said. ""We agreed that all measures that were scheduled until January 31 should be extended until February 14,"" she said. Merkel said the number of new coronavirus infections in Germany was gradually reducing, and this was encouraging. She said the scale of the presence of the ' UK' coronavirus strain in Germany was unclear yet, but there was the threat of a rapid spread of the disease. Overall, since the start of the pandemic, Germany has recorded more than 2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. Over 47,000 people have died. "
"BERLIN: Germany extended and toughened a partial lockdown to February 14, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday, in a bid to halt coronavirus transmission and prevent virus variants believed to be more contagious from propagating in the country. Companies are asked to allow workers to work from home in order to reduce traffic on public transport. Medical masks -- that is surgical or the higher protection FFP2 masks -- are also required in public transport or essential shops such as supermarkets which have been allowed to stay open. Schools, non-essential shops, restaurants, leisure and sporting facilities will remain closed. "
"BERLIN: German prosecutors have charged 12 men with plotting well-funded, armed attacks on mosques in which they planned to kill or injure as many Muslims as possible, authorities said on Friday. ""They aimed through attacks on mosques and the killing and wounding of as many Muslims as possible to create civil war-like conditions,"" prosecutors said in a statement. Prosecutors said the suspects, 11 gang members and one accomplice, had met regularly to plan, with all but one of them pledging to contribute thousands towards a 50,000-euro ($59,000) pot to finance the purchase of weapons. The suspects, aged between 31 and 61, are all Germans and all but one of them has been detained. The twelfth is still at large, prosecutors in the southeastern city of Stuttgart said. Another suspect had died while in custody. A prosecution official said he had killed himself and that there was nothing to indicate foul play. The official said cash sums in the ""mid four-digit range"" had been found in suspects' houses. Germany has experienced a spate of right-wing attacks in recent years directed at minorities and those perceived to support them. Members of the so-called National Socialist Underground were convicted in 2018 for a decade-long spree of murders of ethnic Turks. Last year, another right-wing extremist targeted a synagogue in Eastern Germany, killing two bystanders. A suspected far-right sympathiser is on trial for killing conservative politician Walter Luebcke. Luebcke, a vocal supporter of Chancellor Angela Merkel, had called for refugees to be given the support and welcome they needed during the 2015 refugee crisis. Far-right sympathisers have also been unmasked in the police and armed forces. Far-right extremism is particularly sensitive in Germany because of its responsibility for the Nazis' World War Two genocide of six million European Jews.

"BERLIN: Germany's health minister said new measures would be needed to slow the spread of new, more infectious variants of the coronavirus, including more health checks for cross-border commuters and intensified gene sequencing of virus samples. In future, health labs will have to sequence 5% of the samples they collect when screening for the coronavirus to check if they match more virulent strains first identified in Britain and South Africa, or if new strains were emerging in Germany. National and regional leaders are due to meet on Tuesday to decide on new measures designed to contain the pandemic, which has devastated Europe's largest economy. ""The (infection) numbers seem to be decreasing, which is good, but we are still a long way from where we want to be,"" health minister Jens Spahn told broadcaster ARD. New coronavirus infections have been decreasing in recent days and the occupancy of intensive care beds by COVID-19 patients has declined by 10-15%, according to Spahn, who said intensified testing of cross-border commuters should be introduced to help prevent new strains entering Germany. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told public broadcaster RBB on Monday he could imagine extending the current lockdown by two weeks until mid-February. Stricter requirements for companies to allow staff to work from home, compulsory wearing of heavy duty FFP2 masks in certain areas, restrictions on public transport and the introduction of curfews are being debated. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 7,141 to 2,040,659, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday. That was more than 5,000 down from the week before. The reported death toll rose by 214 to 46,633. "
"BERLIN: RB Leipzig said Tuesday that they have asked the German authorities to grant Champions League opponents Liverpool an exemption to strict new German coronavirus entry rules. ""On Monday, we requested an exemption for Liverpool's entry into the country,"" said Leipzig spokesman Till Mueller. The Bundesliga club are set to host English champions Liverpool in a Champions League last-16 game on February 16, but the match has been thrown into doubt by a partial travel ban which Germany introduced last weekend. The new rules, slated to last until the day after the game, ban travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious coronavirus variants such as Britain. Though there are some exceptions for medical workers and others in key professions, an interior ministry spokesperson told AFP on Monday that the new rules contained ""no special provision for professional sportspeople"". Yet Mueller said Leipzig were working on a solution to the problem. ""We are of course in discussions with the authorities, with Liverpool and with UEFA,"" he said, adding that the club had filed an exemption request with the federal police. ""We hope that we receive a quick response because a lot depends on this,"" he added. According to German media reports, UEFA's regulations decree that Leipzig must find a way of hosting the match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat. Potential solutions include playing the game at a neutral ground outside of Germany, or switching the home and away legs of the tie. Yet Leipzig club bosses insisted that they were optimistic that the game would go ahead as planned. ""It is not our aim to play the game in St. Petersburg or elsewhere,"" club director Oliver Mintzlaff told Bild. Commercial director Florian Scholz added that the club were ""working on the assumption that Liverpool can enter the country"". "
"GENEVA: UEFA set Champions League clubs an extended April 2 deadline on Tuesday to complete their round of 16 games, with Germany's limit on travel from England a pending problem. Liverpool's visit to Leipzig on Feb. 16 for a first-leg game could be affected by federal restrictions on arrivals from England where an aggressive variant of COVID--19 is spreading. ""Currently there is no special arrangement for professional athletes,"" the German interior ministry said on Tuesday. UEFA requires clubs to ""cooperate with their national association in order to obtain from the relevant authorities exemptions from existing travel restrictions, such as border closures and quarantine requirements."" The Champions League last 16 is scheduled to finish on March 17, and quarterfinal first legs are set for April 6-7. The scope for rescheduling games was detailed in updated competition rules published by UEFA on Tuesday for organizing the knockout rounds of the Champions League and Europa League. The Europa League resumes on Feb. 18 at the last-32 stage and the Benfica-Arsenal games also have potential travel issues. UEFA set a March 5 deadline to complete the round, six days before the last-16 stage starts. There are already few options to reschedule postponed games in congested domestic and international programs. National teams worldwide will call up players for the March 22-31 international break, including World Cup qualifying games. If clubs have travel restrictions affecting their home European games, the competition rule books set a deadline of Monday in the week before to alert UEFA. ""(T)he home club must propose a suitable alternative venue which may be in a neutral country,"" UEFA rules state. If Liverpool cannot travel to Germany, the order of games could flip so that Leipzig goes to England for the first leg. German rules allow residents to re-enter the country more easily. If German travel restrictions are extended, Manchester City's first-leg trip to play Borussia Monchengladbach on Feb. 24 could be affected. During the group stages that were due to finish in mid-December, UEFA offered an extension through Jan. 28 to complete postponed games. One Europa League game -- Qarabag's visit to Villarreal -- was not played and forfeited as a 3-0 loss because of COVID-19 cases at the Azerbaijani club. "
"BERLIN: Former Germany coach Berti Vogts has demanded UEFA move the 'Euro 2020' finals to December with coronavirus cases spiking across Europe. ""As a former national coach, I'm now appealing to UEFA: postpone the European Championship,"" Vogts told German news portal t-online. ""React now. Otherwise it will be too late."" The European championships, to be held in 12 countries across the continent, were already switched from last summer to June 11 to July 11 2021. Vogts wants the finals to start ""in mid-December"". ""Hopefully, by then, enough people will have been vaccinated to allow more fans into the stadiums again,"" said the 74-year-old, who won the Euros as both a player and a coach. He also advocated using just one host country, ""preferably in a nation that then has the virus situation well under control"". On Thursday, a UEFA spokesperson told AFP there are no plans to again delay or move the European championships. However, Eintracht Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic, who won the Euros as a player under Vogts in 1996, echoed his former coach's sentiments. ""It is an illusion for a European championship to be held in 12 different countries in June 2021,"" said Bobic in his column on the same site. ""And it would also be the completely wrong signal because of the pandemic."" However, as next season's fixture list has already been approved, Bobic believes ""if the European Championship does not take place in the summer, cancelling it is the only realistic possibility"". "
"KOLKATA: Armed with cutting-edge technology, Victoria Memorial Hall is launching two brand new light-and-sound shows, scrapping the earlier one, for visitors from mid-February. This is part of an array of programmes and events that the ministry of culture has lined up to celebrate the centenary of Victoria Memorial. One of the shows is on Netaji, since his 125th birth anniversary is also being celebrated this year. The other show might be a story on Kolkata, its beginnings and its space in the history of British India and the subsequent nationalist movement. The authorities are in the final stages of finalizing the contents and narrative of the second show. They are ready to start with the show on Netaji. Unlike the style that was used in the earlier light-and-sound shows, where a single narrative ran through the entire length, punctuated with anecdotes and stories that branched from it, this one is almost like a film where the narrative progresses through conversations, interspersed with real-life recordings. Azad Hind Radio, that Netaji started in 1942 in Germany to speak to the freedom fighters here, has been used as a character in the show, the other being Netaji himself. These are voice overs. A team from the National School of Drama did the background research and prepared the script, which has been made in English, Bangla and Hindi. The show has been created by a consortium of Modern Stage Services and Tricolour India Schauspiel. The eastern facade of Victoria Memorial has been chosen for the show, which is not just a digital light-and-sound show but one that uses projection mapping, which is a cutting edge technology and is yet to be used in any monument in the country. âUnlike a flat projection, the technology that we are using can turn any object into a screen and there would be no distortion when the image is projected on the walls. A 3D object is spatially mapped on the virtual programme and that mimics the real environment it is to be projected on,â said Jayanta Sengupta, curator of Victoria Memorial. "
"MOSCOW: Russian police have issued a strong warning against participating in protests planned for Sunday to call for the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's most prominent foe. The warning comes amid detentions of Navalny associates and opposition journalists and a police plan to restrict movement in the center of Moscow on Sunday. Navalny was arrested on January 17 after flying back to Russia from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning. His detention sparked nationwide protests one week ago in about 100 cities; nearly 4,000 people were reported arrested. The next demonstration in Moscow is planned for Lubyanka Square. The Federal Security Service, which Navalny claims arrange to have him poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent on behalf of the Kremlin, is headquartered in the square. The Russian government has denied a role in the 44-year-old's poisoning. The city police department said much of central Moscow from Red Square to Lubyanka would have pedestrian restrictions and that seven subway stations in the vicinity would be closed on Sunday. Restaurants in the area also are to be closed, and the iconic GUM department store on Red Square said it would open only in the evening. Russian Interior Ministry spokeswoman Irina Volk cited the coronavirus pandemic in a Saturday warning against protests. She said participants found in violation of epidemiological regulations could face criminal charges. The January 23 protests in support of Navalny were the largest and most widespread seen in Russia in many years, and authorities sought to prevent a repeat. Police conducted a series of raids this week at apartments and offices of Navalny's family, associates and anti-corruption organization. His brother Oleg, top aide Lyubov Sobol and three other people were put under two-month house arrest on Friday, as part of a criminal probe into alleged violations of coronavirus regulations during last weekend's protests. Sergei Smirnov, editor of the Mediazona news site that was founded by members of the Pussy Riot punk collective, was detained by police upon leaving his home on Saturday. No charges against him were announced. Navalny fell into a coma on August 20 while on a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow. He was transferred to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that he was poisoned. Navalny was arrested when he returned to Russia on the grounds that his months recovering in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence he received in a 2014 conviction for fraud and money-laundering, a case that he says was political revenge. Just after the arrest, Navalny's team released a two-hour video on his YouTube channel about a lavish Black Sea residence purportedly built for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The property features amenities like an ""aqua-discotheque,"" a hookah lounge equipped for watching pole dances and a casino. The video has been viewed over 100 million times and inspired a stream of sarcastic jokes on the internet. Putin has said that neither he nor any of his close relatives own the property, and the Kremlin has insisted it has no relation to the president even though it's protected by the federal bodyguard agency FSO, which provides security for top government officials. Russian state television later aired a report from the compound that showed it under construction and included an interview with an engineer who claimed the building would be a luxury hotel. On Saturday, construction magnate Arkady Rotenberg, a close Putin associate and his occasional judo sparring partner, claimed he owned the property. "
"BERLIN: Berlin's Justice Ministry has approved a request from Moscow for legal assistance in the investigation of the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and has tasked state prosecutors with working with Russian authorities, officials said Friday. Berlin state prosecutors said in a tweet that their office had been commissioned to provide legal assistance to Russia and information on Navalny's state of health, âsubject to his consent.â The office said it would provide no further information on the request at this time. Navalny, the most visible opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on Aug. 20 on a domestic flight in Russia. German chemical weapons experts have determined that the 44-year-old was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent, prompting Berlin to demand that Russia investigate the case. He was kept in an induced coma for more than a week as he was treated with an antidote, before hospital officials said Monday his condition had improved enough for him to be brought out of it. The hospital had no comment Friday on his condition, but doctors have not ruled out long-term effects of the poisoning. The Kremlin has bristled at calls from Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders for Russia has to answer questions in the case, denying any official involvement and accusing the West of trying to smear Moscow. Russian authorities have prodded Germany to share the evidence that led them to conclude âwithout doubtâ that Navalny was poisoned with a military nerve agent from the Novichok group, the same class of Soviet-era agent that British authorities said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. Germany's Defence Ministry has said the data about Navalny has already been provided to the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, of which Russia is a member. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Friday the agency was best equipped to handle an issue that was ânot a bilateral German-Russian problem."" âThis is about a crime that took place in Russia with a chemical nerve agent that is internationally prohibited â the OPCW is the logical point of contact,â he told reporters. On Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry invited German Ambassador Geza Andreas von Geyr to reaffirm Moscow's demand for Germany to provide Russian authorities with the medical data, including biological materials, the results of samples and tests to allow Russian experts to study and check them. Russian doctors previously said they had found no sign of Navalny's poisoning. The move to task Berlin prosecutors to work with Russian investigators came a week after Russia's request for assistance was received by the Berlin state Justice Ministry. Separately, Seibert denied reports that Germany had received a Russian request for permission to send investigators to interview Navalny. "
"NEW DELHI/DAVOS: WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said the vaccine nationalism will prolong the Covid-19 pandemic as he expressed concern that some countries are rolling out vaccine only for their own citizens while the world's least developed nations only wait and watch. Speaking at the last day of the week-long online Davos Agenda Summit of the World Economic Forum, he said many countries are rolling out vaccines for their own people, but it is leaving the most vulnerable people of the world at a big risk. Ghebreyesus said it would be exactly one year on Saturday since the WHO's emergency committee declared a public emergency of international level regarding Covid-19. Incidentally, he was in Davos for the 2020 Annual Meeting of the WEF in January last year when he had to midway leave the summit for the emergency meeting. ""The pandemic has exposed and exploited the inequalities of our world,â he said. âThere is now the real danger that the very tools that could help to end the pandemic -- the vaccines -- may exacerbate those same inequalities,"" the WHO chief said. He said, ""Vaccine nationalism will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering... If we lose trust in international collaboration through vaccine nationalism, we will all pay the price in terms of a protracted recovery."" He said the WHO is asking those governments that have already received deliveries of vaccines to vaccinate their health workers and older people, and share excess doses with COVAX (an alliance of vaccine makers for Covid-19) so other countries can do the same. Speaking in the same session, Norway's Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide also called for global solidarity. âThe only exit strategy from this pandemic is to work together,â she said. German Health Minister Jens Spahn said countries had to vaccinate their own populations to earn public support for international measures, and that if Germany started sending doses elsewhere in the world while it had only vaccinated 3 per cent of its own people, it would not be accepted by Germans. âIf you want a country like Germany to be engaged as we are investing in international vaccine programmes, of course we also need to vaccinate our own people. So it's about the right balance,"" Spahn said. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said there were tensions as every country wanted to get the vaccines. He said there had been a âsmall bump: in supply in Europe for a few weeks while the company increased production capacity. âThe quantities promised in the beginning of December we will catch up by March,â he said, adding that supply this year would now increase from a previous estimate of 1.3 billion doses to more than 2 billion doses. "
"BRUSSELS: Hotspots of Covid-19 infection in the European Union will be labelled ""dark red"" zones to discourage all but essential travel, EU governments agreed on Friday. The EU has already set up a ""traffic light"" system to designate the seriousness of the spread of the novel coronavirus in each of its 27 states and to try to limit travel. But with infections rising and contagious variants spreading most of the bloc is already red, so new dark red zones would help to distinguish very high-risk areas and also help uphold rules requiring testing on departure and quarantine. EU ambassadors agreed the new measure, proposed by the European Commission, at a meeting in Brussels, EU diplomats told Reuters. The new colour will indicate regions with more than 500 coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants over two weeks. At the same time, Germany and other countries announced they intended to take additional travel measures to curb the spread of the virus, one EU diplomat said. Current EU presidency chair Portugal, which is running EU meetings from January to June, said that any new travel measures were up to individual states. Germany is preparing entry bans for travellers from Britain, Portugal, Brazil and South Africa to limit the spread of the more contagious variants of the coronavirus raging in these countries, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Thursday. Belgium has barred residents from taking vacations abroad until March to fight the spread of the more infectious virus variants. However, the EU executive Commission insists that essential workers and goods must be able to cross borders smoothly, part of EU rules guaranteeing free movement. "
"Aurangabad: The city is all set for a âsister city collaborationâ with the Germanyâs Ingolstadt in various sectors including trade, commerce, education, tourism and waste management. The collaboration would pave way for exchange of ideas, technologies and even workforce, eventually creating a win-win situation for both cities.A video conference was held between the officials of Ingolstadt and Aurangabad in the presence of Aurangabad Municipla Corporation (AMC) administrator Astik Kumar Pandey, Bamu vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole, president of Aurangabad First Pritesh Chatterjee, CII Marathwada zonal council president Mukund Kulkarni, Massia president Abhay Hanchanal, CMIA president Kamlesh Dhoot and secretary Satish Lonikar and deputy CEO of Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (ASCDCL) Pushkal Shivam on Tuesday.Suyash Chavan, the consulate-general of India, Munich, who is a native of Nanded, facilitated the meeting. He gave a presentation on Ingolstadt giving details about its geography, its collaborations with cities in different countries and how Aurangabad and Ingolstadt could collaborate.Expressing his satisfaction with the collaboration, Pandey said before January 25, his team would prepare and give a presentation on five key areas on which MoUs could be signed between the two cities. âPrimarily, the areas and sectors where Aurangabad seeks collaboration are universities, chamber of commerce, skill development, tourism and waste management,â he said. Ingolstadt is a historic Bavarian town in Germany known for its heritage and culture. It is also known for its first Bavarian university where a sizable number of Indian students study. Ingolstadt has signed twin city partnerships with around 10 cities across the world. It has chosen Aurangabad as both have rich cultural heritage. Both the cities are also economically connected â German automobile giant Audi, which has its HQ in Ingolstadt, set up its unit in Aurangabad in 2007."
"MOSCOW: A Russian court on Thursday ordered Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to be kept in jail, rejecting an appeal against his detention and shrugging off calls by the West and tens of thousands of his Russian supporters for his release.  Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was remanded in custody for 30 days on Jan. 18 after flying back to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in August.  A court at the time ordered him detained for alleged parole violations, which he denied. With various legal cases pending against him, Navalny, 44, could face years in jail. Tens of thousands of Russians protested against his jailing on Saturday.  Navalny appeared in court on Thursday by video link from jail, railing against what he called absurd allegations trumped up by authorities to sideline him for political reasons.  ""You won't succeed in frightening us. We are the majority... I'm happy that more and more people understand that the law is on our side, that we're in the right,"" he told the presiding judge.  ""We'll never allow ... these people to seize and steal our country. Yes, brute force is on your side now. You can...put me in handcuffs. (But) that will not continue forever,"" he said.  Outside the court on the outskirts of Moscow, his lawyer Olga Mikhailova said they would appeal against the ruling to keep him in custody.  After the ruling was handed down, Navalny told the judge with trademark sarcasm: ""Everything was clear to me before the start of the court hearing, thank you.""  Navalny's allies have called for new protests this weekend to demand his release. The authorities have said any demonstrations will be illegal and will be broken up. SEARCHES OF SUPPORTERS' HOMES Russia's prison service has accused Navalny of breaking the terms of a suspended sentence he had been serving on embezzlement charges that he says were trumped up.  A court hearing on Feb. 2 is set to consider converting that sentence into a three-and-a-half year prison term.  Last weekend police detained just over 4,000 people at demonstrations calling for his release in Moscow and dozens of other cities, according to a protest monitoring group. Authorities have followed up with a sweeping crackdown.  Late on Wednesday, police carried out searches at the homes of Navalny's supporters and other properties linked to him, detaining several people, including his brother Oleg for allegedly breaching COVID-19 safety restrictions.  Russian investigators said on Thursday they had opened a criminal case into Leonid Volkov, a close Navalny ally, for allegedly urging teenagers to take part in what it said were illegal protests on Saturday.  Navalny has accused Putin of being responsible for his poisoning with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent last summer. The Kremlin has denied any involvement. "
"NEW DELHI: The government has extended suspension of scheduled international flights till February 28, 2021. However Vande Bharat Mission and scheduled flights under the travel bubbles India has so far created with 24 countries like US, Germany and France will continue and people eligible as per government norms can fly to and from India on them. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued an order Thursday extending the suspension of scheduled international commercial passenger services to/from India till 11.59 pm (IST) of February 28, 2021. âThis restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA,â the order says. It adds that âinternational scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on case to case basis."" Scheduled international flights were suspended on March 23, 2020, due to the pandemic. Since then, India has been operating Vande Bharat Mission flights to many places and has formed air bubbles with over 20 countries. International air travel is happening on both VBM and air bubble arrangements for allowed categories of travellers. All-cargo international flights are allowed and the DGCA approves flights on a case-to-case basis. "
"HYDERABAD: One of the most common fears surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI), be it in India or globally, is that machines will replace the human workforce but Indians are more comfortable interacting with AI, a recent survey by the global IT player Pegasystems has found. While globally, 35% participants said they were concerned about machines taking away their jobs, for India this number stood at 37%. Pegasystems surveyed 6,000 consumers from Japan, North America, UK, Australia, Germany, and France about their views on AI and empathy and recently, 1,000 consumers from India were added to the study. As per the study, 60% of the Indians surveyed said they were more comfortable in telling the truth to an AI chatbot as compared to the global average of 31%. âTelling the truth to a machine is potentially easier because there isnât a concern about saying the wrong thing or a misunderstanding. Given the huge variety of cultures, subcultures, and myriad of beliefs in the country, there is more chance for misunderstanding or human error if a customer service agent is from a different culture than the customer they are interacting with,â the study said. Interestingly, even with concerns around AI, 50% of respondents in India said they were very comfortable interacting with AI, well above the global average of 11%. The study noted that the investment in AI has been historically lower in India than in the US and China. The lack of a government-backed AI framework has stalled efforts country-wide and VC firms have been hesitant to invest in a market where AI has yet to prove itself as profitable. But that is changing. According to a study by PWC, AI is predicted to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 and Accentureâs research predicts AI has the potential to add $957 billion to Indiaâs economy by 2035.

"CAIRO: Egypt on Monday hosted the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Jordan to discuss ways to revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, a week before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. In a joint statement, the ministers called for practical steps to launch ""credible negotiations"" between Israel and the Palestinians on achieving a Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital in territory Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The ministers said they were ready to work with the US to facilitate negotiations that would lead to ""a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region.'' Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shukry said the establishment of an independent Palestinian state should not threaten Israel's security. ""The existence of an independent and contiguous Palestinian state alongside a secure state of Israel is the main guarantee for achieving stability in our region,'' he told a joint news conference after the ministers' meeting. The Palestinians suffered numerous setbacks under the outgoing administration of President Donald Trump and have complained about what they say were pro-Israeli steps from Washington. They have said, however, that they are ready to work with the incoming Biden administration. Trump has sidelined the Palestinian Authority, recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the US Embassy there from Tel Aviv, slashed financial assistance for the Palestinians and reversed course on the illegitimacy of Israeli settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi met with the ministers earlier Monday. The Egyptian leader said last month that Cairo has been working toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ""taking into account the regional and international changes.'' He was apparently referring to Biden's election and the establishment of ties with Israel by four Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. In the news conference, France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian urged Israel and the Palestinians to initiate and announce their commitment to achieve a solution to the conflict and refrain from taking uniliteral measures. He said such an announcement would be ""a small initiative to build trust between the two parties and start consultations.'' Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted before leaving for Cairo on Sunday that the ministers would discuss ""which concrete steps'' could help build trust between Israel and the Palestinians. In September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for an international conference early in 2021 to launch a ""genuine peace process,'' based on the U.N. resolutions and past agreements with Israel. The Palestinians no longer see the U.S. as an honest broker. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki said last month that the Palestinian Authority was ready to cooperate with the incoming Biden administration, and urged Israel to return to talks based on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For more than three decades, the Palestinians have sought an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories seized by Israel in the 1967 war. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but imposed a crippling blockade when the Palestinian militant group Hamas seized power from Abbas' forces in 2007. There have been no substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was first elected more than a decade ago, and the two sides are fiercely divided over the core issues of the conflict.

"BRUSSELS: The European Union has approved a plan that includes giving state aid to Tesla, BMW and others to support the production of electric vehicle batteries, helping the bloc to cut imports and compete with industry leader China. The European Commission's approval of the 2.9 billion euro ($3.5 billion) European Battery Innovation project, follows the launch in 2017 of the European Battery Alliance that aims to support the industry during the shift away from fossil fuels. ""The EU Commission has approved the entire project. The individual funding notices and funding amounts per company will now follow in the next step,"" a German economy ministry spokeswoman said of the project that is set to run until 2028. Alongside Tesla and BMW, the 42 firms that have signed up and could receive state aid include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Arkema, Borealis, Solvay, Sunlight Systems and Enel X. China now hosts about 80% of the world's lithium-ion cell output, but the EU has said it could be self-sufficient by 2025. Project funding will come from France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. It also aims to attract 9 billion euros from private investors, the European Commission said. The German spokeswoman said Berlin had made almost 1 billion euros available for the initial battery cell alliance and planned to support this project with about 1.6 billion euros. ""For those massive innovation challenges for the European economy, the risks can be too big for just one member state or one company to take alone,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told a news conference. ""So, it makes good sense for European governments to come together to support the industry in developing more innovative and sustainable batteries,"" she said. The European Battery Innovation project covers everything from the extraction of raw materials to design and production of cells, to recycling and disposal. "
"UNITED NATIONS: India and three other G4 nations seeking a permanent seat in the UN Security Council have asserted that the format of the inter-governmental negotiations (IGN) on UNSC reforms can be saved only if there is a single negotiating text and application of the General Assembly rules of procedure. Participating in the first IGN meeting on the UNSC reforms in the 75th session of the General Assembly on Monday, India, Brazil, Japan and Germany underlined that without the two, it can no longer be the forum where the long-pending amendments can ârealistically be achievedâ. During the meeting, they said only two things can save the IGN as a format â negotiations of a single text with attributions, reflecting various positions taken by member states in the last 12 years and the application of the General Assembly rules of procedure. âIf these two things cannot be achieved this year, the IGN will have run its course for us,â Germanyâs Christoph Heusgen said, making a statement on behalf of the G4 nations.

"BASEL (Switzerland): Germany were still waiting for their first-ever Nations League win after they gave a tired performance and were held to a 1-1 draw by Switzerland on Sunday. Ilkay Gundogan gave Joachim Loew's side the perfect start with a clinical goal in the 14th minute but Silvan Widmer earned their smaller neighbours a deserved draw just before the hour. In the end, Germany may have been grateful for the result in the League A Group 4 game as the much livelier hosts, unbeaten in their last 17 competitive matches at home, created the better chances. Nations League: Ansu Fati makes history as Spain thump UkraineGermany, who also let the lead slip in a 1-1 draw with Spain on Thursday, failed to win any of their four games in the inaugural Nations League two years ago and have drawn their opening two games this time around. Switzerland have one point after losing their opener to Ukraine. Germany coach Joachim Loew was left frustrated by his team's failure to capitalise on their early lead. ""We didn't take our chances for a second goal and allowed Switzerland to take control in the second half -- in the end I thought a draw was the right result,"" he said. ""When you lead 1-0 in two games and don't win either, it's annoying. It's a problem that we are not finishing off games... I doubt that Switzerland would have come back from 2-0 behind."" Nations League: Jensen makes instant impact as Finland stun IrelandLoew stuck with his three-man defence and his side made an early breakthrough. Matthias Ginter, despite being surrounded by five defenders, laid the ball back to Gundogan who rolled a shot between Yann Sommer and his near post from 20 metres. Julian Draxler should have added a second shortly afterwards but shot straight at Sommer. Switzerland were let down by their old failing in front of goal with Haris Seferovic the biggest culprit, mis-kicking from six metres after Djibril Sow's pass found him free.

"NEW DELHI: The Covid pandemic has led to a rise in inequality, and it would take an unskilled worker 10,000 years to make what Ambani made in an hour during the pandemic and three years to make what Mukesh Ambani made in a second. As per the Oxfam Inequality Report called this year as ""The Inequality Virus Report"" because of the pandemic said the pandemic has also widened the existing social, economic and gender-based inequalities. ""The rich have been able to escape the pandemic's worst impact, and white-collar workers have easily isolated themselves and have been working from home. However, most of India has faced loss of livelihoods,"" it said. During pandemic, on the day when Indian billionaire, Mukesh Ambani, rose to become the fourth richest man in the world, a farmer, Rajesh Rajak, and his three daughters died by suicide as a result of his job loss. The rising inequality in the country is poignant: It would take an unskilled worker 10,000 years to make what Ambani made in an hour during the pandemic and 3 years to make what Ambani made in a second. The pandemic has also widened the existing social, economic and gender-based inequalities, Oxfam said. Wealth amassed by 100 richest Indians during pandemic can give 13.8 crore poorest Rs 94k each: OxfamThe wealth of Indian billionaires increased by 35% during the lockdown and by 90% since 2009 to $422.9 billion ranking India, sixth in the world after US, China, Germany, Russia and France. This is despite the fact that most of India has faced a loss of livelihoods and its economy has dipped into recession for the first time after a quarter of a century. The increase in wealth of the top 11 billionaires during the pandemic can easily sustain the MGNREGS scheme or the health ministry of India for the coming 10 years, Oxfam said.   Mukesh Ambani, emerged as the fourth richest man in the world and the richest in India and Asia with his wealth rising to Rs 5,837 billion -- a rise of 72 per cent in his wealth. He was making Rs 90 crore per hour during the pandemic at a time when around 24% of the people in the country have been earning under Rs 3,000 per month during the lockdown, the report said. India's wealthiest people escaped the worst impact of the pandemic while the majority of India suffered. This gross asymmetry of power and resources is not just amoral argument, but a practical question, it said. As per International Labour Organization (ILO), with a share of almost 90 per cent of people working in the informal economy, about 40 crore workers in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the crisis. The increase in the wealth of the richest person in India during pandemic could keep 40 crore informal workers out of poverty for at least 5 months. A survey done by Credit Vidya reported that the loss of income among those earning more than Rs 60,000 a month was 10 per cent compared to their pre-pandemic income whereas the income of those earning less than Rs 20,000 a month reduced to 37 per cent of their prepandemic income. Eighty-four per cent of the households suffered a loss in income in April 2020. While 1,70,000 people lost their jobs every hour in the month of April 2020. Approximately 167 people killed themselves due to starvation and financial distress from job loss and reduction in income between March to July 2020, Oxfam said. "

Scholz wants to bring production of important medical equipment back to Europe, a step that will make some of these goods more expensive but more accessible, he said. Scholz further ruled out a cut in income taxes for Germans, given the need for the country to repay economic rescue packages designed to prop up the economy. "
"Nashik: The grape export season has begun and the Nashik district has sent the first container, with 12 tonne of grapes, to Germany. The regular grape harvest season in Nashik begins in December and picks up in January. âGrape export to European countries has begun. The first container from Nashik has been sent to Germany. The volume is expected to increase in the second half of January,â said Kailas Shirsat, the deputy director of the agriculture department of Nashik district. âWe are expecting an increase in grape export this season. Export volume us likely to touch 2 lakh metric tonne,â Shirsat said. The district had exported 1.2 lakh tonne of grapes in the December-April season of 2019-20. The year before that, Nashik had exported nearly 1.4 lakh tonne of grapes. There has been a rise in the number of vineyards registering with the state agriculture department. As per government norms, farmers looking to export grapes must register their vineyards with the state agriculture department. Around 37,090 grape farmers have registered their vineyards measuring 22,780 hectare for the 2020-21 grape season. This is a 30% rise in the number of farmers looking to export their produce. In the previous grape season (2019-20), 28,382 grape farmers had registered their vineyards. The areas under grape plantation in Nashik district is estimated to be around 58,367 hectare, including 22,000 hectare in Niphad taluka, 15,758 hectare in Dindori taluka, 11,671 hectare in Nashik taluka and 5,148 hectare in Chandwad taluka. The rest of the vineyards are located in Bagalan and Kalwan talukas. "
"MOSCOW: Russian police detained an estimated 1,614 people at unauthorised rallies held on Saturday across the country in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the OVD-Info protest monitor said. Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin's most prominent and durable foe, was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a criminal conviction in a case that Navalny says was illegitimate. He is to appear in court in early February to determine if he will serve the 3 1/2-year sentence in prison. Several thousand people turned out for a protest in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, and demonstrations took place in the Pacific port city of Vladivostok, the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and the country's third-largest city of Novosibirsk, among other locations. Thirteen people were reported arrested at the protest in Yakutsk, a city in eastern Siberia where the temperature was minus-50. In Moscow, thousands of people were converging on the downtown Pushkin Square as the protest's planned start neared. A police public-address system repeatedly blared messages telling people not to gather closely because of pandemic health concerns and warning that the protest was unlawful. Helmeted riot officers sporadically grabbed participants and pushed them into police buses. Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days. Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned. Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralised by repressions. He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated. He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face and was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but that many suspected was poisoning.

"NEW DELHI: The number of people who have tested positive for the UK variant of Covid-19 in India has climbed to 150, the Union health ministry said on Saturday. All of them have been kept in single room isolation in designated health care facilities by the respective state governments, the ministry had said earlier. Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine. Comprehensive contact tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others. Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on, the ministry said. The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium) labs. ""The total number of persons found infected with the UK strain of Covid-19 is 150,"" the ministry said. The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by several countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.

"BERLIN: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the same type of Soviet-era nerve agent that British authorities identified in a 2018 attack on a former Russian spy, the German government said on Wednesday, citing new test results. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Navalny was the victim of an âattempted murder by poisoningâ and the aim was to silence him. Merkelâs spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement that testing by a special German military laboratory at the Chariteâs request had now shown âproof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group.â âIt is a dismaying event that Alexei Navalny was the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia. The German government condemns this attack in the strongest terms.â Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putinâs fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on August 20. He was transferred two days later to Berlinâs Charite hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated Navalny had been poisoned. British authorities identified Novichok as the poison used in 2018 on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. The nerve agent is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at the Charite initially identified in Navalny. Germany demanded a response from the Russian government. The White House called the findings âcompletely reprehensibleâ and said that the US will work to hold âthose in Russia accountableâ. The European Union said in a statement that Russia must investigate thoroughly and transparently the assassination attempt of Navaly. British PM Boris Johnson demanded that Russia explain what happened to Navalny. âItâs outrageous that a chemical weapon was used,â he said on Twitter. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists: âWe are ready and have an interest in full cooperation and exchange of data on this topic with Germany.â He also complained that Russia had not received an answer to its request for German doctors to share their findings. âBefore the sick man was taken to Berlin, tests were carried out in our country in accordance with all international standards, no poisonous substances were detected,â he said, not using Navalnyâs name as is Kremlin practice.

"NEW DELHI: German mega airline Lufthansa has tightened its mask requirements. It will require passengers to wear medical protective category â and not everyday use â masks from February 1. The new rule, applicable on all Lufthansa Group airlines on flights to and from Germany, will need to be followed both by passengers and crew members. The order comes in the wake of the new and more infectious strain of Coronavirus. Lufthansa operates flights to and from India under an air bubble arrangement. From February 1, ""passengers will be required to wear either a surgical mask or an FFP2 mask or mask with the KN95/N95 standard during boarding, the flight and when leaving the aircraft. Everyday masks are then no longer permitted,"" Lufthansa said in a statement. ""As before, an exemption from the obligation to wear a mouth-nose covering during the flight for medical reasons is only possible if the medical certificate is issued on a form provided by Lufthansa and a negative Covid 19 test is available that is not older than 48 hours at the scheduled start of the journey. In principle, infection on board is very unlikely. All Lufthansa Group aircraft are equipped with the highest quality air filters, which ensure air quality similar to that in an operating theatre. In addition, the air circulates vertically instead of being dispersed throughout the cabin,"" the statement added. Lufthansa group airlines including Swiss and Austrian had introduced a requirement to wear a mouth-nose mask on board their flights last May. "
"BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday that she has agreed with state governors to extend the country's current lockdown by three weeks until Jan. 31. Merkel said they also are tightening curbs on social contacts, in line with measures imposed at the beginning of the pandemic in March. And they called for new restrictions on movement for people living in areas with particularly high infection rates. The decision came as new coronavirus cases and deaths are running at stubbornly high levels, and officials remain uncertain what effect the Christmas and New Year holidays have had on the situation. Germany launched a nationwide partial shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, leisure and sports facilities. That failed to reduce infection figures, and the current lockdown _ which closed nonessential shops and schools, and further limited social contacts _ took effect Dec. 16. It was initially due to run through Jan. 10. Germany's disease control center reported 944 more Covid-19 deaths. Vaccinations in Germany and the rest of the 27-nation European Union started over a week ago. In Germany, a nation of 83 million, nearly 265,000 vaccinations had been reported by Monday, the Robert Koch Institute said. Opposition politicians and even some within Germany's governing coalition have criticized the EU's cautious advance ordering of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine _ the only one so far cleared for use in EU nations. The EU's medical regulator is also evaluating a vaccine by Moderna. The country's health minister has repeatedly said that the vaccinations are progressing as expected and that the slow start is because mobile teams are first going to nursing homes to vaccinate the most vulnerable, which takes more time than inviting people to mass vaccination centers. Still, in a nod to the heavy pressure, Health Minister Jens Spahn said he has asked the country's agency in charge of vaccinations if the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be delayed in order to be able to vaccinate more people right away with a first shot. Britain has embraced such a plan with its vaccinations, but the move is being hotly debated by scientists and governments around the world. Germany's new infections remain at more than twice the level of 50 per 100,000 residents over seven days, which the government wants to reach. In part because of lower testing and delayed reporting, it's not yet clear what effect the Christmas holidays will have on Germany's new coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Germany has reported 35,518 virus-related deaths overall. "
"LONDON: People are more likely to follow -19 restrictions based on what their friends do, rather than their own principles, according to a study that shows how social influence affects adherence to government interventions. The researchers, including those from the University of Nottingham in the UK, found that the best predictor of people's compliance to the rules was how much their close circle complied with the rules, which had an even stronger effect than people's own approval of the rules. The study, published in British Journal of Psychology, suggests that including experts in human and social behaviour is crucial when planning the next stages of the pandemic response, such as how to ensure that people comply with extended lockdowns or vaccination recommendations. ""When coronavirus first hit the UK in March, I was struck by how differently the leaders in Europe and Asia were responding to the pandemic,"" said lead researcher Bahar Tuncgenc from the University. ""While the West emphasised 'each person doing the right thing', pandemic strategies in countries like Singapore, China and South Korea focussed on moving the collective together as a single unit,â Tuncgenc said. The researchers asked people from over 100 countries how much they, and their close social circle, approved of and followed the -19 rules currently in place in their area. They found that people didn't simply follow the rules if they felt vulnerable or were personally convinced, adding that most diligent followers of the guidelines were those whose friends and family also followed the rules. Close circle's compliance had an even stronger effect than people's own approval of the rules, the researchers said. This discovery applied to all age groups, genders, countries, and was independent of the severity of the pandemic and strength of restrictions. The study also revealed that people who were particularly bonded to their country were more likely to stick to lockdown rules -- the country was like family in this way, someone for whom one is willing to stick their neck out. ""We see scientists and politicians trying to boost the public's approval of the measures, so that vaccination campaigns and lockdowns get the support of the citizens, but approval does not mean compliance,"" said Ophelia Deroy, a professor at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany. ""You may make up your own mind about the measures, or listen to experts, but eventually, what you do depends on what your close friends do"" Deroy said. ""Practical steps could include social apps, similar to social-based excercise apps, which tell people whether their close friends are enrolled for the vaccine. ""Using social media to demonstrate to your friends that you are following the rules, rather than expressing outrage at people who aren't following them could also be a more impactful approach,"" Tuncgenc added. "
"BERLIN: German chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday there was far more common ground with Washington now that Joe Biden has replaced Donald Trump in the White House but acknowledged nagging points of friction. Merkel said Germany and Europe were ready to do their part to address a range of issues in the transatlantic in-tray including the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis and security threats with the new administration. ""There is a much broader scope of political accord with President Biden,"" Merkel told reporters, citing his return to the Paris climate accord and the World Health Organization and his openness to migration as examples. However she noted that observers expecting them to see eye-to-eye on all issues of transatlantic importance would be disappointed, saying there would be ""debates about how we can do things well for both countries"". ""Biden represents the interests of the US, I represent those of the Federal Republic of Germany,"" she said. Asked about US opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to bring Russian gas to Germany, Merkel said there was a need for broad talks with the Biden administration about what types of energy cooperation with Russia were ""acceptable"". But she criticised ""extraterritorial sanctions"" from the US against the project as ""out of order"". ""My view on Nord Stream 2 has not changed,"" she said, despite growing tensions with Russia, most recently over the arrest of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Nord Stream 2 is set to double Russian natural-gas shipments to Germany, Europe's largest economy. It has long been in the crosshairs of the United States, with Trump in particular openly criticising European countries for their reliance on energy from Russia. Work resumed on the nearly completed pipeline in December after an almost year-long suspension caused by US threats of asset freezes and visa restrictions for companies involved. On global security issues, Merkel took a more conciliatory tone, pledging to heed the calls for Germany and Europe to do more to step up cooperation. ""You hear everywhere people rightly saying that Europe will have to take on more responsibility, that means not only militarily but also in the diplomatic arena and many other areas,"" she said. ""But the good news is that we in Germany are ready to do that, the EU is also ready to,"" she said. Merkel said such debates would now take place on a ""broader foundation of shared convictions"". "
"BERLIN: The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has risen to 57,298 and 455 people have died of the disease here, statistics from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday.  Cases rose by 4,751 compared with the previous day while the death toll climbed by 66, the statistics showed.  The highest number of cases, 13,989, are in the southern state of Bavaria, where the disease first appeared in Germany. "
"MEISSEN, Germany: Some coffins are marked ""infection risk"", others have ""corona"" scrawled in chalk, many have the box for ""no memorial service"" ticked, though the hall for such ceremonies has been turned into a temporary mortuary anyway. As Germany's Meissen crematorium struggles to cope with an explosion in deaths from the coronavirus pandemic in the region, coffins are stacked up to three high or even stored in hallways awaiting cremation. Largely spared in the first wave of the outbreak, the eastern state of Saxony has topped Germany's worst-hit zone for weeks in the second wave. In the three decades he has worked at the crematorium in Meissen, Joerg Schaldach has not seen such high numbers of deaths sustained over such a long period of time. ""It started in mid-November, the numbers kept rising,"" Schaldach, who runs the site, told AFP. ""The problem is that the cold storage capacity is now full. We are in a state of catastrophe,"" he said, explaining that there was no choice but to use the memorial hall to hold bodies. Benches and chairs usually used by mourners at memorial services have been stacked up at the back. In their place are rows of wooden coffins, many with the telltale transparent film used to double-seal the bodies of Covid patients. ""We're now getting 400 in a week for cremation"", twice that of typical fatalities during the winter, said Schaldach. As he spoke, his colleagues were shifting more coffins into the memorial hall in a bid to make space in the actual mortuary, which opens out to a loading bay where others were arriving. In the parking area, undertaker Matthias Moebius has already been waiting for an hour for space to unload the casket in his vehicle. ""They're packed right up to the door,"" he said, pointing to where they would normally unload the coffins. ""Usually it takes 10-15 minutes, we drive in, unload, go to the office with the paperwork, and we're off,"" he said. ""These days, it's closer to 90 minutes."" Behind him is a queue of casket vehicles -- three other undertakers are waiting. Moebius, who has been in the job for 20 years, said this winter had brought more work ""by far"" than he has ever had to handle. To cope, Meissen crematorium is running 24 hours, seven days a week, with two furnaces in operation to cremate 60 bodies every day. Staff are working overtime and giving up their weekends. Retirees have returned to help and even family members are chipping in. Ingo Thoering, 76, who had worked at the crematorium since 1999 before his retirement, has come back to lend a hand even though his age places him in the risk group. He accompanies coroners as they carry out the final viewing of corpses to ascertain their identities and determine if any qualify as suspicious cases. Shrugging off the infection threat, Thoering said: ""Fear is of no use at work. At my age, I'm no longer afraid."" Germany shuttered restaurants and cultural or leisure facilities from November, and later also closed schools and most shops in December to halt the second wave. But on Thursday, the country saw a new high in daily deaths, at 1,244. Overall, the death toll stands at 43,881, according to the Robert Koch Institute. Other crematoriums in coronavirus hotspots have also warned they are at their limit. The city of Dresden on Wednesday said that a hall used to store flood protection equipment would serve as a temporary mortuary. Nuremberg has brought in cold storage containers as the crematorium ran out of space. Across the border on Monday, the Czech Republic said it was prohibiting cremations on its territory of bodies ""imported"" from neighbouring countries. Schaldach believes that German authorities could have done more earlier to prevent the second wave of infections, including imposing mandatory testing at elderly care homes or tougher mask requirements. ""They were caught napping in the summer,"" he said. He believes corona deniers who travelled from all over Germany to the city of Leipzig in Saxony for a huge demonstration in November could have also helped spread the disease. ""What I would like to say to the corona sceptics is: come and join us, help us move the coffins. ""We have stacked up a whole lot of coffins -- that means we have moved 750 tonnes of deceased (people). ""Some have the idea that all this is a movie scene that was shot in the summer,"" he said. ""The corona deniers... can come and touch all these (coffins) for themselves."" "
"BRUSSELS: EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has warned the Iran nuclear deal is at a ""critical juncture"", as Tehran's moves to breach it threaten efforts to get the US back on board. ""We have seen very concerning developments on the nuclear side as well as new rounds of US sanctions,"" Borrell wrote to EU foreign ministers in a letter seen by AFP on Tuesday. ""That risks undermining diplomatic efforts, including ours, to facilitate a US return to the JCPOA and to bring back Iran to the full implementation of its JCPOA commitments,"" said the letter sent ahead of a meeting of the top diplomats on Monday. The JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is the instrument agreed to implement the 2015 accord. The EU and other signatories to the pact are pushing to get US President-elect Joe Biden to return to the agreement after scrambling to keep it alive following Donald Trump's withdrawal over two years ago. But they face a struggle to get Iran and the US back on the same page after Trump reimposed harsh sanctions and Tehran responded by breaching limits set by the deal. The Iranian government has signalled a readiness to engage with Biden, who takes office on January 20 and has himself expressed willingness to return to diplomacy with Tehran. But supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has insisted the US must start out by lifting its sanctions on Tehran. That could be a tough sell as Iran has set about pushing back against the constraints in the deal that sought to curb its nuclear programme in return for relief from the punitive measures. Signatories Britain, France and Germany on Saturday called on Iran to halt plans to produce uranium metal, after Tehran told the UN's nuclear watchdog it was advancing research on the issue. That move came after Iran announced earlier in January that it had started the process of enriching uranium to 20 percent. That represents its biggest break yet from its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal struck with world powers. "
"BERLIN: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,571 to 2,39,507, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by three to 9,288, the tally showed. "
"MOSCOW: The Kremlin on Tuesday dismissed Western demands to free top opposition politician Alexei Navalny and said his calls to stage mass protests were troubling. ""We hear these statements. We cannot and are not going to take these statements into account,"" President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists, in the Kremlin's first reaction to Navalny's arrest on Sunday when he flew back to Russia from Germany. Peskov said the Kremlin was also ""troubled"" by Navalny's calls to stage ""illegal"" protests after he was ordered jailed for 30 days on Monday. "
"FRANKFURT: Norway has changed its policy on the use of Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine to consider excluding the terminally ill, following reports of deaths in highly frail recipients after the inoculation was given, BioNTech said on Monday. ""Norwegian Health Authorities have now changed (their) recommendation in relation to vaccination of the terminally ill (Clinical Frailty Scale 8 or higher),"" BioNTech. The Clinical Frailty Scale, a widely used system of classification in elderly care, defines degree 8 patients as approaching end of life and typically unable to ""recover even from a minor illness"". The Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a statement posted on Friday and updated on Monday that ""common adverse reactions may have contributed to a severe course in elderly people who are frail"". 23 die in Norway after receiving Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, 13 were nursing home patientsAs of Jan. 14, 23 reports of suspected deaths have been submitted to the Norwegian health registry, it said. ""An evaluation should be carried for each individual patient as to whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of eventual side effects,"" the Norwegian agency said. In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, the medicines agency said. Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said at a news briefing on Monday that the country's vaccine regulator saw no need to revise guidelines and that it was in contact with their Norwegian counterparts. The safety of vaccines is garnering global public attention after drugmakers developed the shots breakneck speed to curb a pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people. Norway vaccine fatalities among people 75 and older rise to 29US and European vaccine developers have pledged to uphold the scientific standards their immunisations will be held against in the race to contain the virus. Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there was no evidence so far of a causal link between the deaths of vulnerable patients in Norway and vaccination. ""We do not yet know, but it would seem that the observed numbers of deaths is not notably above the numbers expected, but this will need to be examined continually in all countries where it can be done,"" he said. "
"BERLIN/MADRID: Germany warned on Thursday against travel to neighbouring countries, Belgium's foreign minister went into intensive care and Spain said Covid-19 was ""out of control"" in many areas, as governments across Europe took action to fight the pandemic. As German authorities reported more than 10,000 daily cases for the first time, Berlin issued travel warnings for Switzerland, Ireland, Poland, most of Austria and many Italian regions, including the capital Rome. ""The situation overall has become very serious,"" Lothar Wieler, of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's infectious diseases agency, said in Berlin, adding: ""We still have a chance to slow a further spread of the virus."" After Europe appeared to have gained a measure of control over the epidemic following the dramatic lockdowns of March and April, a surge in cases over recent weeks has put the continent back at the heart of the crisis. Hospitalisations and deaths across most of Europe have not yet reached the levels of the initial wave early this year, but authorities in many countries worry the situation could rapidly get worse. More than 5.3 million people in Europe have contracted the disease and over 204,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). India has had more than 7.7 million cases - the world's highest tally after the United States with 8.3 million. But elsewhere in Asia, from China to South Korea or New Zealand, draconian lockdowns and rigorous contact tracing have helped contain the disease. Grappling with the enormous costs of the coronavirus, Europe's leaders are desperate to avoid a repeat of the blanket lockdowns that shut down their economies in the spring. But as cases have surged, and health services have come under increasing pressure, they have been forced to impose and expand local restrictions aimed at reducing public gatherings to ever wider areas. Underlining the reach of the disease, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes went into intensive care on Thursday. German Health Minister Jens Spahn tested positive a day earlier. ""OUT OF CONTROL""""The second wave is a reality,"" Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa said on Thursday. ""In many areas of our country, the epidemic is out of control."" A number of Spanish regions are calling for localised curfews such as those implemented in France and Italy, where Lazio, the region around Rome, has joined Lombardy and Campania around Milan and Naples in imposing overnight curfews. Amid the growing public alarm, Germany's statistics office noted that sales of toilet paper rose almost 90% last week from pre-crisis levels with almost equally sharp jumps in sales of disinfectants and soap. Only Sweden, a European outlier which has relied largely on voluntary measures to promote social distancing, was an exception, declaring senior citizens no longer need to isolate themselves given lower COVID infection rates than in spring. As the crisis has intensified, much of the public goodwill seen in the first phase of lockdowns has evaporated and central governments have engaged in angry spats with local authorities from Manchester to Madrid over issues ranging from health and welfare to transport and schools. With winter coming, health services are looking ahead with apprehension as the wave of COVID patients coincides with the usual seasonal respiratory illnesses. ""We are already swamped,"" said Bruno Megarbane, head of intensive care at the Lariboisiere hospital in Paris. ""So, indeed, there is the fear that we will face a very difficult situation."" "
"MOSCOW: Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny flew home to Russia on Sunday despite Russian authorities' stated desire to arrest him and potentially jail him for years, his plane from Berlin landing at a different Moscow airport from the one it was meant to fly to. It was the first time Navalny has been back home since he was poisoned last summer. His plane was diverted to another Moscow airport at the last minute in an apparent effort by authorities to thwart journalists and supporters greeting him. His plane had been meant to arrive at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport, but landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport instead. The flight was operated by Russian airline Pobeda, owned by state-controlled Aeroflot. Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent domestic critics, was flown to Berlin in August last year for emergency medical treatment after being poisoned with what German tests showed was a Novichok nerve agent. ""This is the best moment in the last five months,"" he told reporters after he boarded the plane in the German capital bound for Moscow. ""I feel great. Finally, I'm returning to my home town."" He announced his decision to return from Germany on Wednesday, and a day later Moscow's prison service said it would do everything to arrest him once he returned, accusing him of flouting the terms of a suspended prison sentence for embezzlement, a 2014 case he says was trumped up. The 44-year-old, who boarded the plane at the last minute from a car sitting on the tarmac, hence avoiding other passengers, made light of the risk of returning home. He said he didn't think he would be arrested, calling himself an innocent person. ""What do I need to be afraid of? What bad thing can happen to me in Russia?"" he added. ""I feel like a citizen of Russia who has every right to return,"" he added. He was accompanied by his wife Yulia, his spokeswoman, and his lawyer. Navalny, who is hoping for success in parliamentary elections in September, faces potential trouble in three other criminal cases too, all of which he says are politically motivated. CONUNDRUM FOR KREMLIN His return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests and punitive Western action by turning him into a political martyr. Or do nothing and risk looking weak in the eyes of Kremlin hardliners. The opposition politician, who says he has nearly fully recovered, says Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin denies involvement, says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned, and that he is free to return to Russia. Navalny says the Kremlin is afraid of him. The Kremlin, which only refers to him as the ""Berlin patient,"" laughs that off. Putin allies point to opinion polls that show the Russian leader is far more popular than Navalny, whom they call a blogger rather than a politician. Before news the plane was being diverted to another airport, some of his supporters gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport despite bitterly cold minus 20 Celsius weather and over 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital. Riot police made several detentions at the airport and cleared a crowd of people waiting for Navalny to land, Reuters reporters saw. There was a heavy police presence at the airport with dozens of police trucks. Before Sunday, at least 2,000 people used a Facebook page to say they planned to be there, with another 6,000 expressing an interest. The Moscow prosecutor's office, which says it has officially warned 15 pro- Navalny organisers, had said the event was illegal because it was not sanctioned by the authorities. "
"BERLIN: Germany's Julia Goerges, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2018, announced her retirement from tennis on Wednesday. ""I have always known that I would feel it when the right time has come to say goodbye - and the moment is here,"" the 31-year-old, currently ranked 45th in the world, posted on social media.

Goerges won a total of seven singles and five doubles titles on the WTA tour. Her highest ranking was ninth in the world two years ago, the season she lost to Serena Williams in the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Goerges played her last match earlier this month at the French Open, her 48th appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam, when she bowed out in the second round. She was one of only three German women to earn a top 15 ranking in both singles and doubles along with Steffi Graf and Claudia Kohde-Kilsch. "
"BERLIN: Germany defender Lukas Klostermann needs knee surgery, Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig said Tuesday. The 24-year-old defender will undergo keyhole surgery on his left knee on Wednesday to determine how long he will be out for. Klostermann went down in Saturday's 2-0 away win at Augsburg, which kept Leipzig top of the German league after four games. The injury rules him out of Tuesday's Champions League home match against Turkish side Basaksehir. Leipzig's mobile centre-back played out of position in Germany's most recent internationals this month. He set up Leon Goretzka's winning header from the right wing in a 2-1 away win against Ukraine in the Nations League, then switched to right-back for the 3-3 draw with Switzerland. "
"BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right party on Saturday chose Armin Laschet, the pragmatic governor of Germany's most populous state, as its new leader- sending a signal of continuity months before an election in which voters will decide who becomes the new chancellor. Laschet defeated Friedrich Merz, a conservative and one-time Merkel rival, at an online convention of the Christian Democratic Union. Laschet won 521 votes to Merz's 466. A third candidate, prominent lawmaker Norbert Roettgen, was eliminated in a first round of voting. Saturday's vote isn't the final word on who will run as the center-right candidate for chancellor in Germany's Sept. 26 election, but Laschet will either run for chancellor or will have a big say in who does. Merkel, who has been chancellor since 2005, announced in late 2018 that she wouldn't seek a fifth term. She also stepped down from the CDU leadership. The decision ends an 11-month leadership limbo in Germany's strongest party after outgoing leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who had failed to impose her authority on the party, announced her resignation. A vote on her successor was delayed twice because of the coronavirus pandemic. There had been no clear favorite going into Saturday's convention, but the election of Merz would have marked at least a symbolic break with the Merkel era. Laschet will now have to work to secure party unity. Laschet, 59, was elected in 2017 as governor of North Rhine-Westphalia state, a traditional center-left stronghold. He governs the region in a coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats, the CDU's traditional ally on the right, but would likely be able to work fairly smoothly with a more liberal partner. Current polls point to the environmentalist Greens as a possible key to power in the election. Laschet pointed Saturday to the value of continuity and moderation, and cited the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump as an example of where deliberate polarization can lead. ""Trust is what keeps us going and what has been broken in America,"" he told delegates before the vote. ""By polarizing, sowing discord and distrust, and systematically lying, a president has destroyed stability and trust."" ""We must speak clearly but not polarize,"" Laschet said. ""We must be able to integrate, hold society together."" He said that the party needs ""the continuity of success'' and ""we will only win if we remain strong in the middle of society."" Laschet said that ""there are many people who, above all, find Angela Merkel good and only after that the CDU."" He added that ""we need this trust now as a party"" and that ""we must work for this trust."" Saturday's result will now be officially endorsed in a postal ballot - which is expected to be a formality but is required by German law. The CDU is part of the Union bloc along with the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, and the two parties will decide together on the center-right candidate for chancellor. The Union currently has a healthy poll lead, helped by positive reviews of Merkel's handling of the pandemic. CSU leader Markus Soeder, the governor of Bavaria, is widely considered a potential candidate after gaining in political stature during the pandemic. Some also consider Health Minister Jens Spahn, who supported Laschet and was elected as one of his deputies, a possible contender. Polls have shown Soeder's ratings outstripping those of Saturday's CDU candidates. Laschet has garnered mixed reviews in the pandemic, particularly as a vocal advocate of loosening restrictions after last year's first phase. He shouldn't expect much of a honeymoon as CDU leader. This year also features six state elections, the first two in mid-March. Merkel, now 66, has steered Germany, and Europe, through a series of crises since she took office. She has also broken repeatedly with conservative orthodoxy, for example by accelerating Germany's exit from nuclear energy and ending military conscription. Her 2015 decision to allow in large numbers of migrants led to divisions on the center-right and strengthened the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which entered Germany's parliament two years later. Alternative for Germany co-leader Joerg Meuthen said Laschet's election means the CDU ""will carry on Merkeling'' and asserted that his party ""remains the only conservative party in Germany "
"BERLIN: Germany's Christian Democrats elect a new chairman on Saturday, aiming to unite their conservative party behind a new leader who they hope can succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor when she steps down after federal elections in September. At stake is the leadership of Europe's biggest economy in the era after Merkel, who has vowed not to run again after becoming Europe's predominant leader since taking office in 2005 and proving a winner with German voters. The new CDU leader will be elected by 1,001 delegates at a digital congress. By tradition, the leader is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU's ""Union"" with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Centrist Armin Laschet, arch-conservative Friedrich Merz and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are vying for the CDU leadership. However, polls show Markus Soeder, the CSU leader, is voters' choice conservative. Some CDU lawmakers want dynamic health minister Jens Spahn to run for chancellor, though he has backed Laschet for the party leadership. The three declared CDU candidates all contrast with Merkel. Roettgen, 55, the eloquent chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China. Merz, 65, has targeted European Central Bank policy and is less diplomatic. Laschet, 59, who has polished his international profile, complains Berlin has taken ""too long to react"" to French calls for European Union reform. Roettgen has suggested that, if elected CDU leader, he could support Soeder, Bavaria's premier, to run as chancellor candidate for their alliance. Soeder, 54, has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late. He plays coy about his ambitions - ""My place is in Bavaria"" has been his repeated refrain. Carsten Nickel at Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said Soeder's deft move towards the centre ground could make him the ideal candidate to lead a coalition with the ecologist Greens. ""But of course, the true challenges will arise when liberal and conservative demands clash,"" Nickel added. "
"BERLIN: A global coronavirus vaccine rollout suffered a major blow Friday as Pfizer said it would delay shipments of the jabs in the next three to four weeks due to works at its key plant in Belgium. Pfizer said the modifications at the Puurs factory were necessary in order to ramp up its production capacity from mid-February of the vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech. There will be ""a significant increase"" in deliveries in late February and March, the US group promised. The European Commission also confirmed that promised doses for the first quarter will arrive within the period. But European Union nations, which are desperately waiting for more doses to immunise their populations against the virus that has already claimed almost two million lives worldwide, expressed frustration. Germany, the EU's biggest economy, voiced regret over the ""last minute and unexpected"" delay. It urged the European Commission -- which undertook joint procurement for the bloc -- to ""seek clarity and certainty"" for upcoming shipments. Six northern EU nations also warned in a letter to the Commission that the ""unacceptable"" situation ""decreases the credibility of the vaccination process"". The letter signed by ministers from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden further asked the Commission to ""demand a public explanation of the situation"" from the pharmaceutical companies. Across the Atlantic, Canada also said it was impacted by the delays, calling it ""unfortunate"". ""However, such delays and issues are to be expected when global supply chains are stretched well beyond their limits,"" said Canada's Procurement Minister Anita Anand. Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine, which was developed at record-breaking speed, became the first to be approved for general use by a Western country on December 2 when Britain gave it the go ahead. After Britain rolled out its immunisation drive, the EU followed from December 27. The latest shipment delay will likely add fuel to anger over the bloc's vaccination campaign, which has already been criticised for being too slow compared to the United States or former EU member Britain. The European Commission has also been accused of not securing enough doses early enough. Just last week, the EU struck a deal to double its supply of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine to 600 million doses. The urgency of immunising the population has grown over fears of virus variants first seen in South Africa and Britain, which officials warn are more infectious. But vaccine makers had repeatedly warned that production capacity was limited. While Pfizer is augmenting capacity at Puurs, its partner BioNTech on Friday secured authorisation to begin production at Germany's Marburg. The challenges of getting millions of vaccines around the world are also huge as the BioNTech/Pfizer jabs must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially-designed cool boxes filled with dry ice. Once out of ultra-cold storage, the vaccine must be kept at two Celsius to eight Celsius to remain effective for up to five days. "
"BERLIN: The new coronavirus strain sweeping Britain has been in Germany since November, health officials said Tuesday, after detecting the variant in a patient who died in the north of the country. Researchers were ""able to sequence the variant of the B1.1.7 virus in a person infected in November this year"", the health ministry of Lower Saxony said in a statement referring to the new strain. This is the same strain ""responsible for a large proportion of the infections detected in the south of England,"" it said. The variant was found in an elderly patient with underlying health conditions who has since died. His wife was also infected but survived. The couple caught the virus after their daughter returned from a trip to Britain in mid-November, where she ""in all likelihood"" became infected with the new strain, the statement said. Teams from the Hannover Medical School (MHH) were able to identify the new strain after sequencing the genome. The results were then confirmed by a team at Berlin's Charite hospital, which included top German virologist Christian Drosten. Germany had previously reported only one case of the new strain, in a woman who flew in from London on Thursday. Britain sounded the alarm earlier this month over the variant, which authorities say is significantly more contagious. Concerns over the strain have prompted many countries to suspend travel to and from Britain. It has since been detected in several other nations, including Portugal, France, Jordan and South Korea. Germany has banned arrivals from the UK by road, sea and air until January 6. "
"BERLIN: The German sports doctor at the centre of the ""Aderlass"" international blood-doping trial was on Friday sentenced to 4 years, 10 months in prison by a court in Munich. Dr Mark Schmidt, 42, has also received an additional ban from practising medicine for a further three years after masterminding an international blood doping ring between 2012 and 2019. He has also been fined 158,000 euros ($191,821). The Erfurt-based sports physician has been found guilty of 24 counts of using doping methods and two counts of forbidden use of medicinal drugs. The trial, which started last September, is the first major prosecution under anti-doping legislation introduced in Germany in 2015. Blood doping is aimed at boosting the red blood cells, which allows the body to transport more oxygen to muscles, increasing stamina and performance. Two of Schmidt's four co-defendants were each given suspended sentences of two years, four months and one year, four months. The other two, one of whom is Schmidt's father, were each given fines of 6,560 euros and 9,900 euros. In court last week, Schmidt expressed remorse, ""I took a wrong turn, it's all my fault,"" and regrets involving his four co-defendants: ""I am infinitely sorry that I dragged the other four into it"". He has been in custody since Austrian and German police smashed the bloody doping ring during co-ordinated raids in February 2019, as part of Operation Aderlass - 'Blood-letting' in German. The raids included a swoop on the 2019 Nordic World Skiing Championships in Seefeld, Tirol. Five athletes and two suspects were detained at the championships, two hours before the start of the men's 15km cross-country event. One Austrian athlete was caught undergoing a blood transfusion. Schmidt was arrested at the same time during raids in Erfurt, central Germany. Initially, the list of events affected by Schmidt's blood doping ring was impressive, including competitors at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics, the 2016 Rio de Janeiro summer Olympics and 2018 Tour de France. On Tuesday, Austrian cyclist Stefan Denifl became the latest athlete jailed due to the smashing of the Aderlass ring, when he received a two-year sentence, 16 months of which will be suspended. However, contrary to what anti-doping authorities had hoped for, no big names from the sporting world were revealed during the trial's four months, which was often interrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic.

"FRANKFURT: German car giant Volkswagen and its subsidiary Audi said Thursday they would temporarily cut production and furlough workers as the auto industry suffers from a shortage of vital computer chips. Volkswagen is sending roughly 8,800 employees at its plant in Emden, northern Germany, into short-time work until January 19, the carmaker told AFP in a statement. The plant produces Volkswagen's own-brand Passat model. Luxury subsidiary Audi meanwhile is placing 10,000 employees on reduced hours until the end of January in Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm, both in the south of the country, the company told DPA news agency. Semiconductor shortages have hampered auto production across the industry in recent weeks. When car sales fell at the start of the Covid-19 crisis last spring, many chip manufacturers switched production to consumer electronics, which saw rising demand as the pandemic kept people at home. The auto market has however since seen a rebound in sales, leading to critical bottlenecks in the supply chain. Ford and Toyota said earlier this week they were slowing down or even stopping production at US factories due to the shortfall. ""The limited supply of semiconductors due to rapidly recovering car markets is causing considerable disruptions in worldwide vehicle production across all manufacturers,"" Volkswagen said in the statement. ""Countermeasures and alternatives are continuously being examined in order to limit the effects of the supply bottleneck and thus the number of vehicles affected."" Volkswagen had already said on Wednesday it would stop production for several days at its main Wolfsburg site due to the shortage that affected its Tiguan and Touran models. "
"COPENHAGEN: The World Health Organization's European branch on Thursday said 95 percent of vaccine doses so far administered worldwide were limited to 10 countries and called for a more equitable distribution. In terms of total doses the top countries are the US, China, the UK, Israel, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Russia, Germany, Spain and Canada. ""Collectively, we simply cannot afford to leave any country, any community behind,"" WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said at an online press conference. Kluge said the WHO was working to get the vaccine to every country but, ""it needs every country capable of contributing, donating and supporting equitable access and deployment of the vaccines, to do so."" According to website Our World in Data, over 32 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered so far. In the WHO's European Region, which comprises of 53 countries and includes Russia and several countries in Central Asia, 31 countries have launched vaccination programmes. But despite the start of vaccination campaigns the speed of transmission observed in some countries due to new more contagious variants, especially the so-called English and South African ones, was worrying, according to Kluge. ""This is a concerning situation,"" he said. In the European region, 25 countries, including Russia, have recorded cases of the strain first discovered in the UK, and dubbed ""VOC 202012/01"". ""So far, we understand there is no significant change to the disease this variant produces, meaning the COVID-19 is not more, nor less, severe,"" Kluge said. ""At the same time, we are concerned for two reasons: This variant has a higher transmission rate. Secondly is the question of what does this mean for vaccines,"" Kluge added. However, Kluge also stressed that there were still reasons to be optimistic. ""2021 will be another year of the coronavirus, but this will be a more predictable year, the situation will be easier to control."" "
"BERLIN: Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick insists the European champions learn from their earliest German Cup exit for 20 years after second division side Holstein Kiel ended their dreams of repeating last season's treble. ""We are extremely disappointed, we wanted to defend the treble,"" said Flick after Bayern were knocked out of a cup competition for the first time since he took charge in November 2019. ""There are no excuses left - lots of games, too little rest,"" said Flick, pointing at Bayern's tightly-packed fixture list this season which often demands his team plays every few days. ""We have to tick it off and do things better. ""We have to be more compact in defence, protect the central midfield better and apply more pressure."" Bayern have five weeks to fix their porous defence before facing Lazio away in the last 16, first leg tie in their Champions League defence. However, the Bundesliga leaders' hopes of repeating last season's triple-trophy haul is over following their German Cup exit. Like the heavy snow which fell during the second-half, Kiel were ice cold in taking their chances. Goals by Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sane gave Bayern a 2-1 lead with 90 minutes gone, but a lapse in concentration allowed Kiel captain Hauke Wahl to header a last-gasp equaliser. Bayern then laid siege to the hosts' goal, but Kiel held the European champions to a 2-2 draw after extra time and their nerve for a 6-5 victory in the penalty shoot-out. After both sides netted their opening five attempts, Bayern midfielder Marc Roca was the first to have his saved. It left Kiel's former Bremen forward Fin Bartels, 33, who had earlier scored a first-half equaliser, to net the crucial penalty and spark wild celebrations. The game was played behind locked doors due to high numbers of the coronavirus in Germany, but Kiel fans made their presence felt outside the stadium, blaring car horns and setting off fireworks. ""You wanted to win the triple again?!"" Kiel fans jeered at Bayern's team bus as it pulled out of the stadium car park after midnight. Kiel are the first non-Bundesliga club to knock Bayern out in the cup's second round since Magdeburg, then in Germany's fourth-tier, in 2000/01. ""Something like this happens perhaps once in a lifetime,"" beamed Kiel's 32-year-old coach Ole Werner. The last time Bayern exited the German Cup so early, Thomas Mueller had just joined their youth structure as an 11-year-old. ""The cup exit is brutal. This is certainly not the best phase for FC Bayern,"" Mueller said. The loss follows last Friday's 3-2 league defeat at Moenchengladbach. Bayern have conceded 24 league goals this season - more than any of the other top six clubs in the Bundesliga. Having lost his temper in a post-match interview, Mueller later apologised on Instagram to an ARD reporter he felt was amused by Bayern's defeat. ""Now you are laughing here,"" he fumed after being asked what the mood was like in the Bayern dressing room. Bayern need to bounce back in Sunday's tricky home tie against Freiburg, who are on a club-record five-game winning streak in the league. "
"Chandigarh: Punjab government has got four Holstein Friesian (HF) breed bulls imported from Germany. State animal husbandry and dairy development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, the National Dairy Development Board has imported these bulls to enhance the germ plasm of cross breed cows in the country. Bulls provided to Punjab will not only boost milk production but also help improve the breed of milch cattle. As traditional agriculture is no longer a lucrative sector for farmers due to the rapidly increasing cost of food production, Punjab government is focusing on developing dairy as an allied farming sector, for which the state government is providing free insemination, vaccination and other services to livestock farmers. The animal husbandry department charges a nominal fee from livestock farmers for most of the services. Additional chief secretary (animal husbandry) V K Janjua said the imported HF bulls are in the age group of 10 to 12 months and semen production will start in the next two years. During the first year, around 8,000 to 10,000 semen straw production is expected from these bulls, which will increase to 25,000 semen straws in the coming years. He said introduction of exotic germ plasm into the local gene pool will result in overall improvement of the breed. H S Kahlon, director, animal husbandry, said these four imported bulls have been kept at the semen bank in Ropar under the supervision of experts. When semen production from these new bulls starts, semen straws will be distributed to all veterinary hospitals and dispensaries of districts through the semen bank. These will be utilised for artificial insemination program of the department, he added. "
"MOSCOW: Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Wednesday he would fly back to Russia on Jan. 17 from Germany where he has been recovering after being poisoned, shrugging off potential legal risks that could see him jailed. Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's leading critics, was airlifted to Germany for treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in what Germany and other Western nations say was an attempt to murder him with a Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities deny any involvement in the incident. ""It was never a question of whether to return or not. Simply because I never left. I ended up in Germany after arriving in an intensive care box for one reason: they tried to kill me,"" Navalny wrote on Instagram. ""(President Vladimir Putin's) servants are acting as usual by fabricating new criminal cases against me. But I'm not interested in what they're going to do to me. Russia is my country, Moscow is my city and I miss it,"" he wrote. Navalny said he had probably almost fully recovered his health. His announcement came a day after court documents showed Russian authorities had asked a court to jail him for allegedly breaking the terms of a suspended sentence for what he says was a politically-motivated conviction. Russia's Federal Prison Service (FSIN) last month ordered Navalny to immediately fly back, and to report at a Moscow office or be jailed if he failed to return in time. He and his allies have accused Russian authorities of trying to scare him from returning ahead of parliamentary elections due to be held in September. Russia has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has denied trying to harm him. The Kremlin has said Navalny is free to return to Russia at any time like any other Russian citizen. "
"FRANKFURT AM MAIN: German company BioNTech, which developed the first coronavirus vaccine approved in the West, said Monday it expects to produce two billion doses in 2021, up from the 1.3 billion previously forecast. ""We now believe that we can potentially deliver approximately 2 billion doses in total by the end of 2021, which incorporates the updated six-dose label,"" said the company, referring to an additional dose that could be extracted from each vial of the vaccine. European regulators last week approved doctors drawing six doses from each vial, boosting dosage capacity by 20 percent. The Mainz-based company, which developed the jab with US giant Pfizer, is planning to open a new factory in Marburg, Germany, in February, expected to ramp up production capacity by 750 million doses a year. The site will join five other sites in Germany, Belgium and the US shared with Pfizer. The company said it had shipped nearly 33 million doses by January 10, more than a month after Britain became the first Western nation to approve any vaccine on December 2. BioNTech's announcement comes after the EU agreed to raise its orders of the vaccine by 200 million doses, with an option for another 100 million. But the vaccination rollout has been criticised across Europe, with sluggish starts in nations like France and the Netherlands. The company added that Covid-19 will ""likely become an endemic disease"", and that vaccines would need to fight against the emergence of new viral variants and a ""naturally waning immune response"". The German company said last week that studies show its vaccine works against the new mutation found in variants uncovered in Britain and South Africa. "
"BERLIN: Germany has agreed to provide more than a half billion euros to aid Holocaust survivors struggling under the burdens of the coronavirus pandemic, the organization that negotiates compensation with the German government said Wednesday. The payments will be going to approximately 240,000 survivors around the world, primarily in Israel, North America, the former Soviet Union and Western Europe, over the next two years, according to the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference. With the end of World War II now 75 years in the past, Holocaust survivors are all elderly, and because many were deprived of proper nutrition when they were young today they suffer from numerous medical issues. In addition, many live isolated lives having lost their entire families and also have psychological issues because of their persecution under the Nazis. ""There's this kind of standard response for survivors, that 'we've been through worse, I've been through worse and if I survived the Holocaust, through the deprivation of food and what we had to go through, I'll get through this,''' said Greg Schneider, executive vice president of the Claims Conference, in a telephone interview from New York with The Associated Press. ""But if you probe deeper you understand the depths of trauma that still resides within people.'' Many are also on the poverty line, and the additional costs of masks and other protective gear, delivery groceries and other pandemic-related expenses has been crushing for many, Schneider said. ""You're teetering between making it every month,'' he said. ""Having to decide between food, medicine and rent.'' The new funds are targeted to Jews who aren't receiving pensions already from Germany, primarily people who fled the Nazis and ended up in Russia and elsewhere to hide during the war. Schneider said about 50% of Holocaust survivors in the U.S. live in Brooklyn and were particularly hard-hit when New York was the center of the American outbreak, but now numbers are looking worse in Israel and other places. ""It's a rolling calamity,'' he said. Each of those survivors will receive two payments of 1,200 euros ($1,400) over the next two years, for an overall commitment of approximately 564 million euros ($662 million) to some of the poorest survivors alive today. The funds come on top of an emergency $4.3 million the Claims Conference distributed in the spring to agencies providing care for survivors. In addition to the coronavirus-related funds, Germany agreed in the recently concluded round of annual negotiations to increase funding for social welfare services for survivors by 30.5 million euros ($36 million), to a total of 554.5 million ($651 million) for 2021, the Claims Conference said. Germany's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment on the latest round of negotiations. The money is used for services including funding in-home care for more than 83,000 Holocaust survivors and assisting more than 70,000 with other vital services, including food, medicine, transportation to doctors and programs to alleviate social isolation. As a result of negotiations with the Claims Conference since 1952, the German government has paid more than $80 billion in Holocaust reparations. Part of the Claims Conference's annual negotiations also includes working with Germany to expand the number of people eligible for compensation. This year, the German government agreed to recognize 27 ""open ghettos'' in Bulgaria and Romania, enabling survivors who were in those places to receive compensation payments. "
"NEW DELHI: The number of people who have tested positive for the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 in India has climbed to 96, the health ministry said on Monday. Till Saturday, the number of such people was 90. ""The total number of persons found infected with the mutant UK strain of Covid-19 is 96,"" the ministry said. All these people were kept in single-room isolation at designated healthcare facilities by the respective state governments, it had earlier said. Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine and a comprehensive contact-tracing exercise has been initiated for the co-travellers, family members and others, the ministry said, adding that the genome sequencing of other specimens is going on. The situation is being monitored and regular advice is being given to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG laboratories. The presence of the new UK variant of the coronavirus has been reported by several countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.

"BERLIN: Germany's foreign minister headed Tuesday to Greece and Cyprus, pledging âfull solidarityâ with them in their dispute with Turkey over sea boundaries and drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Germany holds the rotating European Union presidency and before departing Berlin, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Greece and Cyprus had both German and EU backing but urged an âhonest effort on all sidesâ to find a solution. Greece on Monday accused neighbour Turkey of undermining efforts to ease a crisis over eastern Mediterranean drilling rights, after Ankara redeployed a survey vessel for new energy exploration in disputed waters â including an area very close to a secluded Greek island. The move reignited tensions over sea boundaries between Greek islands, Cyprus and Turkey's southern coast, which had flared up over the summer, prompting a military build-up, bellicose rhetoric and fears of a confrontation between the two NATO members and historic regional rivals. The Turkish search vessel, Oruc Reis, left the port of Antalya on Monday for a mission expected o end October 22. Maas stressed that talks between the nations can only work in a âconstructive atmosphereâ and appealed âto Turkey not to close the window for dialogue that has just opened with Greece through unilateral measures.â âAnkara must stop alternating between relaxation and provocation if the government is interested in talks, as it has repeatedly said,â he said. Renewed Turkish gas exploration in the disputed areas would be âa major setback to efforts to de-escalate and thus also for the further development of EU-Turkey relations,â Maas said. "
"NEW YORK: Germany's UN envoy, during his last scheduled UN Security Council meeting, appealed to China to free two detained Canadians for Christmas, prompting China's deputy UN envoy to respond: ""Out of the bottom of my heart: Good riddance."" Germany finishes a two-year term on the 15-member council at the end of this month and Ambassador Christoph Heusgen plans to retire after more than 40 years as a diplomat. ""Let me end my tenure on the Security Council by appealing to my Chinese colleagues to ask Beijing for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Christmas is the right moment for such a gesture,"" Heusgen told the council session, whose official agenda topic was Iran. Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who was working as an adviser for the International Crisis Group think tank, and businessman Spavor were detained by Beijing in 2018 shortly after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. China's deputy UN ambassador, Geng Shuang, accused Heusgen of abusing the Security Council to launch ""malicious"" attacks on other members ""in an attempt to poison the working atmosphere"". ""I wish to say something out of the bottom of my heart: Good riddance, Ambassador Heusgen,"" Geng said. ""I am hoping that the council in your absence in the year 2021 will be in a better position to fulfil the responsibilities...for maintaining international peace and security."" Heusgen also used the Security Council meeting to advise Russia's deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy, to read certain articles about Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who said he had tricked a Russian secret agent into disclosing details of a botched plot to kill him. Russia's FSB security service dismissed the recording as a fake. Polyanskiy replied: ""It seems he's developed a certain dependency on the council, there's never a meeting without criticism of Russia even if that's not suitable for the subject matter. I hope that after Jan. 1 that Christoph's symptoms will improve."" "
"GELSENKIRCHEN (Germany): Schalke 04's American teenager Matthew Hoppe got a sensational hat-trick on his fifth Bundesliga appearance to carry his struggling side to a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim on Saturday and snap the Royal Blues' 30-game winless streak in the league. Hoppe, who made his Bundesliga debut in November, chipped the ball over keeper Oliver Baumann after a superb pass by Amine Harit to finish off a quick break three minutes before halftime. The pair combined perfectly twice more for the 19-year-old Hoppe to score again in the 57th and 63rd minutes. Morocco international Harit then turned scorer by drilling in their fourth goal after 80 minutes as Schalke climbed off the bottom of the table. The California-born Hoppe joined Schalke in 2019 from the Barca Residency Academy in Arizona. Schalke, whose previous league win was back in January 2020, were a defeat away from matching Tasmania Berlin's Bundesliga record of 31 matches without a win from the 1965/66 season. "
"BERLIN: Germany reported a record 1,188 daily Covid-19 deaths on Friday, only days after further tightening a national lockdown amid fears that a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus may put additional strain on struggling hospitals. Europe's largest and most populous economy hopes to be able to limit the spread of the virus until enough of its population has been vaccinated against Covid-19 to achieve herd immunity. On Tuesday, chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers agreed to restrict non-essential travel for residents of hard-hit areas all over Germany for the first time, after a lockdown decreed in December failed to significantly reduce infection numbers. The death toll reported by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases on Friday surpassed a previous record of 1,129 registered on Dec. 30, taking the total in connection with the pandemic to 38,795. RKI also confirmed another 31,849 new infections, one of the highest daily tallies so far. ""Every two minutes, someone dies of the coronavirus in Germany,"" Bavarian premier Markus Soeder told the regional parliament, urging critics to take the threat seriously. The premier of the eastern state of Thuringia, one of the hardest-hit areas in Germany, called on the government in Berlin to extend the shutdown to the whole economy, as in the first wave of the pandemic, to curb the surge in infections. ""I don't see any other option,"" Bodo Ramelow told broadcaster MDR, shortly after the neighbouring state of Saxony reported the first discovery of the more transmissible variant of the virus in a traveller returning from Great Britain. In Berlin, one of the worst affected of Germany's states, authorities postponed the reopening of schools after the Christmas break until Jan. 25. They had been due to restart on Monday. Germany is also considering suspending flights from additional countries, including Ireland, over concerns about the new variant of the virus, broadcaster n-tv reported, citing government sources. "
"BERLIN: German health minister Jens Spahn said on Thursday he expected there to be a Covid-19 vaccine in the coming months and definitely next year, speaking after the public health agency withdrew a report suggesting there would be one in autumn. ""I'm optimistic that in the next months, and certainly in the next year, there can be a vaccine,"" Spahn told ZDF television. His forecast appeared to chime with a report that the Robert Koch Institute issued on Wednesday and later withdrew, in which the public health agency said it expected a vaccine by the autumn. The institute later said the document was not up-to-date and had been published in error. Spahn declined to name a specific month in which the vaccine would be ready, saying it was not yet possible to determine how often people would need to be vaccinated or how long-lasting the immunity it conferred would be. He added: ""But one thing we can say is that thanks to us all working together - researchers, scientists, the public - we will probably have a vaccine faster than ever before in the history of humanity."" German Research Minister Anja Karliczek has previously said any vaccine was unlikely to be widely available before the middle of next year. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Tuesday that Russia had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing. Spahn repeated his scepticism of that vaccine, dubbed ""Sputnik V"", saying it had not yet been broad tests like with other vaccines and there was relatively little data about it. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,445 to 219,964, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday, while the reported death toll rose by 4 to 9,211.

"BERLIN: Bundesliga bottom side Schalke welcome back Arsenal loanee Sead Kolasinac on Saturday in their desperate bid to avoid a league-record equalling 31 games without a win. Having joined Arsenal in 2017, Kolasinac, a product of Schalke's academy, returns on loan until the end of the season to help the club fight relegation after nearly thirty consecutive years in Germany's top flight. Their last league win was in January 2020 and failure to beat Hoffenheim at home will see Schalke equal the record of Tasmania Berlin, who went 31 games without a win during their single, disastrous Bundesliga season in 1965/66. ""No one should be afraid of this challenge,"" demanded Kolasinac, who made 123 appearances for Schalke from 2012 until 2017. ""I have a strong back, but I can't carry the whole load alone. ""We all have to stick together. We need the fans, the whole club, the supervisory board."" Approaching the halfway point of the season, Schalke are bottom and seven points from 15th which means guaranteed survival. Under Christian Gross, their fourth head coach since September, cash-strapped Schalke need a new forward after Wales striker Rabbi Matondo joined Stoke City on loan. Schalke are desperate to avoid matching Tasmania Berlin, who played in the 1965/66 Bundesliga season as last-minute replacements after Hertha Berlin were thrown out for breaking salary rules. Catapulted up from the regional leagues, Tasmania scored only 15 goals, won two of their 34 games, conceded a league-record 108 goals and were relegated in last place, never to return to the Bundesliga. Despite winning their first game in front of 80,000 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, heavy defeats saw interest dwindle and just over 800 spectators turned up to one home game. ""It was a suicide mission,"" Hans-Gunter Becker, who captained Tasmania in 1965/66, told AFP subsidiary SID. ""We also had 800 spectators for one game, a record that will never happen again, unless you include the coronavirus era, but there is no need to talk about that."" The 82-year-old still remembers the stress of being branded the league's worst side and has sympathy with Schalke. ""I know from experience about this burden that weighs on the players,"" he added. ""I would really like it if the Schalke players find it in their hearts to say 'Let's leave the record to Tasmania'."" "

"BERLIN: Germany will publish a much-anticipated report on right-wing extremism in its security forces on Tuesday after a string of scandals over far-right networks in the police and military. Several regional German police forces have been caught up in far-right scandals in recent months, and a unit of the country's elite KSK commando force was dissolved in July over neo-Nazi allegations. Conservative Interior Minister Horst Seehofer will on Tuesday reveal an estimate of the number of right-wing extremists in the police and other security services, including the BfV domestic intelligence agency. Around 300,000 members of the security forces were asked to fill out anonymous questionnaires for the report in the hope of breaking what unions and experts have called a culture of silence. According to initial figures unveiled in September by the daily Die Welt covering the period from January 2017 to March 2020, Germany's police and intelligence services could be harbouring ""more than 350 suspected cases"" of extremism. The German government had previously refused to carry out a full investigation into extremism as it feared tarnishing the reputation of the police and intelligence services, instead favouring a case-by-case approach. But in a change of stance last week, Seehofer said the government would take a ""rigorous"" approach and ""not cover anything up"". Pressure has been mounting on the government for several months to address the issue of far-right networks in the police and military. The Social Democrats, the junior partner in Angela Merkel's coalition government, have repeatedly demanded action and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier called in September for a ""more resolute"" fight against right-wing extremism. Germany has been hit by a string of far-right attacks over the last 18 months, leading to Seehofer naming far-right extremism the ""biggest security threat facing Germany"". But at the same time, evidence has mounted of far-right extremism within the police, security forces and military. Links between the far right and the police are highlighted in the make-up of the Bundestag lower house of parliament, where five of the far-right AfD party's 89 MPs are police officers -- the highest number of any party. In Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, 30 police officers were suspended in September for spreading ""repulsive"" far-right propaganda in online chatrooms including swastikas, pictures of Adolf Hitler and a digitally altered image of a refugee in the gas chamber of a concentration camp. A similar case was uncovered in Berlin in late September. In July, prosecutors announced the arrest of a former police officer and his wife who they suspect of having sent threatening emails to politicians and other public figures across Germany. The anonymous messages were all signed ""NSU 2.0"", a reference to the German neo-Nazi cell National Socialist Underground that committed a string of racist murders in the 2000s. The so-called ""NSU 2.0"" affair has already claimed the scalp of police chief Udo Muench of the state of Hesse, who resigned after it emerged that police computers were used to search for details about a far-left politician who subsequently received one of the threatening letters. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer ordered the partial dissolution of the KSK commando force in June after revelations that some of its members harboured neo-Nazi sympathies. The elite force is charged with sensitive and risky missions such as hostage rescue operations or anti-terror action abroad. But suspicions that some members harbour far-right extremist sympathies have plagued the force for years. Germany's Military Counter-Intelligence Service (MAD) has said some 600 Bundeswehr soldiers were suspected of right-wing extremism, including 20 in the elite force. "
"BHOPAL: Bhopal Express now boasts of red, state-of-the-art Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches which offer best of the amenities to make the train journey comfortable for the passengers. LHB are the passenger coaches of Indian Railways that have made by Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala. They have been used since 2000 on the broad gauge network of Indian railways. Initially, 24 air-conditioned coaches were imported from Germany for use in the Shatabdi Expresses, after which the Rail Coach Factory started manufacturing them post technology transfer. These coaches are designed for an operating speed up to 160 kmph and could go up to 200 kmph. The tare weight of the AC chair car was weighed as 39.5 tonnes.They are considered to be âanti-telescopicâ, which means they do not flip in case of a collision (mainly head-on). They are made of stainless steel and the interiors are made of aluminium which make them lighter compared to conventional rakes. Each coach also has an âadvanced pneumatic disc brake systemâ for efficient braking at higher speeds, âmodular interiorsâ that integrate lighting into ceiling and luggage racks with wider windows. The improved suspension system of LHB coaches ensures more riding comfort for the passengers compared to conventional rakes. The air-conditioning system of these coaches is of higher capacity compared to the older rakes and is controlled by a microprocessor which is said to give passengers better comfort than the older coaches during summer and winter seasons.

"HYDERABAD: People of Vemulawada assembly constituency in Rajanna-Sircilla district will have to wait a little longer for their MLA, Chennamaneni Ramesh, to return to the constituency. The TRS MLA is unlikely to return to Vemulawada constituency before Christmas. He had gone to Germany in March and has not returned since then. Also, a case pertaining to a row over his citizenship is posted for hearing in the Telangana high court on December 16. The Union home ministry had cancelled his Indian citizenship in November 2019. However, he got a stay order on it from the high court. If Ramesh loses the case in high court, he not only stands the risk of losing Indian citizenship but also his MLA seat. Though Ramesh has been conducting video conferences from Germany with party leaders and officials working in the constituency and staying in touch with the people, the TRS leadership has taken a serious view of his long absence and has issued an ultimatum asking him to return by December-end. Former Karimnagar MP and state planning commission vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar said: âRamesh has been in constant touch with the people of the constituency in various ways. He was not able to return due to the pandemic and flight services being suspended. We have asked him to return at the earliest. He is expected to arrive any time after Christmas,â Vinod Kumar said. Meanwhile, opposition parties slammed the ruling TRS over the absence of the MLA from the constituency for such a long time. âThe local legislator should be with the people in times of crisis. The people of this constituency have suffered due to the lockdown. I was with the people and extended them all the help I could. What is the use of such an MLA who goes and sits in Germany when people who voted for him needed him the most,â said Aadi Srinivas of the Congress who lost the 2018 assembly polls to Ramesh. Repeated calls, messages on WhatsApp and e-mails to Ramesh remained unanswered. "
"FRANKFURT AM MAIN: German biotech firm CureVac announced Monday the start of final phase clinical trials for its coronavirus vaccine before seeking approval from regulators. The company said more than 35,000 people would take part in the tests in Europe and South America. ""The first volunteer has been recruited,"" CureVac said in a statement . Germany is battling an explosion of new coronavirus infections and is imposing a partial lockdown from Wednesday. CureVac follows Germany's BioNTech which has already gained approval in the United States, Britain and Canada for its vaccine developed with US pharma giant Pfizer. Both vaccines use a new technology based on mRNA. The process entails injecting a short sequence of viral genetic material to trigger an immune response by producing proteins acting against the virus. CureVac launched second phases trials at the end of September with 690 volunteers in Peru and Panama. Results are expected to be published soon. But Swiss pharma company Novartis on Monday reported that phase three trials with its drug ruxolitinib had failed to show improvement when treating severe Covid-19 patients. The drug, sold under the brand names Jakafi and Jakavi, is used to treat myelofibrosis. The European Union has earmarked 225 million doses of CureVac's candidate with an option for 180 million more if it wins regulatory approval. The company listed on the New York-based Nasdaq stock exchange this year and $150 million of the funds raised is pledged to develop the vaccine. CureVac also made headlines in March with reports that President Donald Trump had sought to secure exclusive rights for the United States to its potential vaccine. Both the company and US officials denied the claim, but the reports sparked outrage in Berlin and prompted Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to declare ""Germany is not for sale."" Britain launched a mass vaccination campaign last week using the BioNTech-Pfizer product and the US was due to kick off its programme on Monday. "
"NEW DELHI: The temporary suspension of India-UK flights may be extended by some time beyond December 31, Union aviation minister H S Puri said on Tuesday. Last week, India had suspended passenger flights to and from the UK between December 23 and 31, following many others countries like Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Italy due to the Coronavirus variant found in the United Kingdom. âI personally foresee a slight extension of the temporary suspension beyond December 31. I donât expect that extension to be a long or an indefinite one. In the next day or two, we will find out if any additional steps need to be taken, or when we can start easing the current suspension,â said Puri. India and the UK have 67 weekly flights operated by four airlines. Almost 2,000-2,500 passengers fly daily on these flights. âWe went back to November 25 and did contact tracing and gene sequencing of passengers who had directly or indirectly come from the UK since that date. So far, six people who came from the UK have been detected with the new Covid strain,â added Puri. "
"BENGALURU: At least six of the more than 100 UK returnees whoâve tested Covid-19 positive so far have been found to be infected by the new UK variant, with three of them in Karnataka. According to the ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW), about 33,000 people disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK between November 25 and December 23. âSo far, only 114 have been found positive, and all their samples were sent to the 10 designated Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) Labs for sequencing,â the ministry said. It added that as on Tuesday (Dec 29) morning, six samples â three sequenced at NIMHANS, Bengaluru, two at CCMB, Hyderabad and one at NIV, Pune â have the new UK variant. All these persons have been kept in single room isolation in designated health care facilities by respective state governments. Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said: âThe designated labs directly send the results of the genomes that are sequenced to ICMR, which released the initial details this morning. Weâve also learnt about it only today and so far, we know that of the three in our state, there are two, a mother and daughter, from one family.â He added that all the returnees who have tested positive so far â even if evidence for them being infected by the new variant is awaited â are being isolated and treated. âWeâve even traced their primary and secondary contacts,â Sudhakar said. Other than these three labs, NIBMG, Kolkata, ILS, Bhubaneswar, CCS, Pune, CDFD Hyderabad, InSTEM, Bengaluru, IGIB, Delhi and NCDC, Delhi â are sequencing genomes. âThe situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the States for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing & dispatch of samples to INSACOG labs. It is important to note that the presence of the new UK Variant has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore, so far,â MoH&FW said.

"BERLIN: Germany was battling a second virus wave much more deadly than the first on Wednesday with record fatalities, as Joe Biden pledged to inoculate 100 million people in his first 100 days as US president. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is urging regions to take much more drastic action to curb the spread, after state leaders agreed measures that would see comparatively modest social restrictions eased even further for the Christmas holidays. The darkening mood in Germany was in stark contrast to the joy ushered in by Britain doling out the first approved jabs in the Western world on Tuesday. Both Russia and China have already begun inoculation campaigns with domestically produced vaccines and the United States is expected to grant emergency authorisation soon to the Pfizer-BioNTech jab -- the same one used in Britain. Israel accepted its first shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promising to be the first to be injected -- though it has yet to pass regulatory hurdles. ""What is important to me is that Israeli citizens get vaccinated,"" he said. ""I want to serve as an example to them."" The virus has now killed more than 1.5 million worldwide since it emerged in China late last year. Merkel has been in no mood for celebration, repeatedly urging local leaders who have responsibility for health policies to clamp down more strongly -- Germany's death toll hitting a new high of 590 on Wednesday. ""If we have too many contacts before Christmas and it ends up being the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we'd really have failed,"" she said. Two weeks ago, Germany's states agreed rules limiting social mixing to five people but agreed to double the limit to 10 for the holiday season -- something Merkel argued against. The United States is also mired in political rows over an epidemic that has killed more than 280,000 -- the world's worst toll. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday that sought to guarantee access to vaccines for all Americans, but critics immediately queried what legal force it could have as drug firms have already signed contracts with other countries. Biden, who will take over from Trump in January, urged Congress to come up with funding to stop the virus response from stalling, and unveiled his plan for 100 million jabs in his first 100 days. ""I'm absolutely convinced that in 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better,"" he said on Tuesday. Merkel was not the only one issuing dire warnings -- UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet telling reporters that the pandemic had zeroed in on fissures in societies and had exposed ""all our failures to invest in building fair and equitable societies"". Proving her point, experts are warning that hunger in the Philippines has reached new levels thanks in part to restrictions that have crippled the economy and left many without livelihoods. ""If you go out there everybody will tell you that they're more afraid of dying from hunger than dying from Covid,"" said Jomar Fleras of the Rise Against Hunger NGO. And there were dark warnings too for democracy, with a Swedish-based watchdog saying more than 60 percent of countries had put in place anti-democratic measures during the pandemic. Kevin Casas-Zamora of International IDEA told AFP he expected authoritarian governments to act in this way but added: ""What is more surprising is that so many democracies have adopted measures that are problematic on the standpoint of democracy and human rights."" Even countries trying to push forward with democratic processes have faced criticism -- Indonesia being the latest to hold elections against the advice of experts. ""Health is being trumped by political demands and that's very concerning. It's not worth it,"" said Hermawan Saputra of the Indonesian Public Health Experts' Association. "
"AURANGABAD: A woman tax consultant from the city was duped of Rs 21.50 lakh in the span of 21 days by a man who befriended her on social while claiming that he was a professional living in Germany. The 37-year-old woman, a resident of Sayhyadrinagar in N-5 Cidco of New Aurangabad, has stated in her complaint that the suspect contacted her on Facebook messenger on November 7 and introduced himself as Li Chang Anderson. The suspect befriended her and the frequency of their interaction increased. A few days later, the duo exchanged their WhatsApp numbers and started chatting. He took advantage of the fact that the woman had separated from her husband and pretended to be supporting her emotionally, said police while quoting her complaint. Asked about the modus operandi used by the criminals, Cidco police station inspector Ashok Giri said that after winning her trust, the suspect offered to send some Diwali gifts to the woman, who reluctantly agreed and was told the same would be sent by courier. âA few days later, the woman received a call from another suspect claiming to be an official from the Delhi-based customs department and asked her to deposit Rs 31,000 as fee for the articles, including international currency and jewellery, which she did,â he said. The officer said that soon after the woman fell into the trap, the suspects made her deposit money in multiple bank accounts under the pretext of GST, taxes and duties. âTo avoid suspicion, the suspects also prepared a dummy email address and kept forged stamp duty papers with her. Each time the woman would refuse to deposit cash, the suspects would threaten her with legal action for defaulting on customs duty. She deposited Rs 21.50 lakh in different bank accounts by November 30, when she realised that she may have been cheated,â said Giri. Police have registered an offence under IPC section 420 (cheating) and other relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act late Thursday evening. "
"FRANKFURT (Germany): Germany coach Joachim Loew sees no reason to question everything during an ongoing overhaul process despite last month's thrashing by Spain and gave assurances on Monday that the team were on the right track towards next year's Euros. Germany lost 6-0 away to Spain in the Nations League on November 17, their heaviest competitive reverse ever, piling pressure on Loew, whose team have struggled in the past few months. ""We were all bitterly disappointed and angry with the result,"" Loew told a virtual news conference. ""But we are absolutely convinced of the road we have taken in 2019."" ""There is no reason to upset the applecart."" Loew, who has been in charge for a Germany record 14 years and led his country to their 2014 World Cup triumph, started an overhaul after their first-round exit at the 2018 World Cup. The Germans have been eliminated at the group stage in their last three tournaments -- one World Cup and two Nations Leagues. ""We knew there would be difficulties along the way and we factored those in. The trust in players and their work and performances is there. I am absolutely convinced,"" Loew said. ""In 2019 we had a good year and we won seven of eight (Euro) qualifiers. We saw the team developed. They are on a good path despite the defeat (by Spain). ""The players have quality, passion and are eager to play for the team."" "
"LONDON: Europe on Wednesday began lifting travel bans on Britain put in place to contain a new fast-spreading Covid strain while WHO experts were set to meet on a response to it. Meanwhile, in the United States, President Donald Trump rejected a massive Covid economic relief package passed by Congress, branding it ""a disgrace"" as millions of Americans are suffering fallout from the pandemic. There was however positive news in Australia, where Sydney eased lockdown restrictions for Christmas after the country's largest city reported a second day of new cases in the single digits. The new coronavirus variant has swept the UK and spurred global panic just as vaccines are being rolled out. But the European Commission on Tuesday urged EU nations to lift travel bans imposed on Britain in recent days. The new strain of the virus, which has also been detected in small numbers elsewhere, appears to spread more easily than other types but experts say there is no evidence it is more lethal or resistant to vaccines. The discovery unleashed panic that led to more than two dozen countries suspending UK flights, threatening travel chaos during the holiday season. The European Union instead urged virus tests be carried out on passengers within 72 hours before travel. ""Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions,"" the EU said. France was reopening cross-border travel with Britain Wednesday but a negative Covid-19 test will be required. The ban on arrivals in France has led to long tailbacks of freight lorries in southern England and has disrupted passenger travel in the run-up to Christmas. The Netherlands also said it was lifting its ban beginning Wednesday but noted that all passengers, including EU citizens, must have a recent negative test to enter. The World Health Organization in Europe said its experts would meet on Wednesday to discuss how to handle the outbreak, saying ""limiting travel to contain spread is prudent until we have better info"". WHO's Europe director Hans Kluge wrote on Twitter that the organisation would ""discuss strategies for testing, reducing transmission & communicating risks"". In response @WHO_Europe to convene member states to discuss strategies for testing, reducing transmission & communiâ¦ https://t.co/F4RB96B3tD— Hans Kluge (@hans_kluge) 1608621222000The death toll from the virus surpassed 1.7 million on Tuesday, roughly a year after it emerged in China. Germany on Tuesday extended its ban on arrivals from the UK -- as well as South Africa, where a similar variant has been found -- until January 6. Health Minister Jens Spahn said that ""as long as it is possible"", Germany aims to prevent ""potentially dangerous virus mutations from spreading in continental Europe"". The European Union is preparing its rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Sunday, following similar vaccination campaigns in the UK and the US. Mexico said it would start its Covid vaccinations on Thursday. The co-founder of BioNTech said on Tuesday it was ""highly likely"" that its vaccine would work against the mutated strain detected in Britain. And if not, the vaccine could be adapted in six weeks, said Ugur Sahin, adding that tests are already being run on the variant. In the US, the world's worst-affected country, top infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci received his Covid-19 vaccine as officials continued to seek to build confidence among the public. But Trump's rejection of the $900 billion Covid relief package passed overwhelmingly by Congress led to concern, though lawmakers can override his veto if he goes through with it. Britain has become increasingly isolated, and one of the biggest concerns was France's ban on freight traffic as part of a 48-hour blockade on the movement of people across the English Channel. Late Tuesday, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced Britain and France had settled on a protocol that ""will see the French border reopen to those travelling for urgent reasons, provided they have a certified negative Covid test."" French Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebarri also confirmed that air travel, boats and Eurostar trains would ""resume service as of tomorrow morning"". Despite the breakthrough in talks, congestion around the key southern port of Dover remains unlikely to recede in the short term. The major British transit hub said it would reopen from midnight local time (2300 GMT) for travellers with a negative result. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted that supply chains were ""strong and robust"", experts warned that Britain may face shortages of certain fresh foods over Christmas if crossings to France were not reopened Wednesday. Meanwhile, two cardinals close to Pope Francis have contracted Covid-19, according to sources in the Vatican, where efforts were underway to trace their recent contacts. The 84-year-old pope, known for his love of getting close to the faithful, has been reluctant to wear a mask despite the pandemic that has hit Italy hard. "
"BENGALURU: Infosys has won the largest deal ever in its history from German automotive major Daimler that sources said is estimated at $3.2 billion, spread over eight years. The deal involves a massive infrastructure overhaul and migration to a hybrid cloud environment. It will bolster Infosysâs presence in the automotive space and will allow Daimler to focus on its core engineering and digital capabilities. The latest win is bigger than the $1.5-billion Vanguard deal that Infosys bagged in August. The Daimler-Infosys deal is so significant that Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani took to Twitter to call it an industry defining partnership. Infosys and Daimler declined to comment on the deal size and the timeline. TOI was the first to report the deal last month and had said that it involves 600 people transferring to Infosys from Daimler. Though mega deals have returned to deal street, the margins are leaner with commoditised services making up for a large part of the business. Daimler will transform its IT operating model and infrastructure landscape across workplace services, service desk, data centre, networks and SAP Basis together with Infosys. As a part of this partnership, automotive IT infrastructure experts based out of Germany, wider Europe, the US and the APAC region will transition from Daimler to Infosys. Infosys has seen many people takeover deals in the recent past and has integrated more than 16,000 employees through other partnerships in recent years. Jan Brecht, chief information officer in Daimler and Mercedes-Benz, said, âSoftware becomes modular and IT infrastructure becomes big. Daimler will take three steps at once to transform its IT infrastructure: consolidation, scaling and modernisation. We need to think infrastructure beyond the size of our company. Moreover, this is a strategic partnership for Daimlerâs IT capabilities and Infosysâ automotive expertise.â The deal involves stitching a robust IT infrastructure across Daimlerâs plants and regions, consolidating data centres and scaling IT operations. The deal contours highlight a smart hybrid cloud, leveraging Infosys Cobalt and other cloud providers, accelerating the multi-cloud journey with a focus on open source adoption and AI-powered anytime-anywhere workplace solution that empowers the end-users. Sources told TOI that Shishank Gupta, SVP and service offering head in Infosys Validation Solutions, has been identified to oversee the Daimler account. "
"BRUSSELS: European Union leaders had hoped the relief of seeing each other face-to-face after five months apart under coronavirus lockdown would ease their fraught debate. It did not turn out that way - despite beginning with cheerful elbow bumps and birthday gifts for 66-year-old Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor and a veteran of Brussels' conference rooms. When the 27 leaders emerged into the dawn light on Belgium's national day on Tuesday to unveil their post-virus recovery plan, they had been locked in a formal summit for four days and nights - more than 90 hours of horsetrading. This made it the longest EU summit since the marathon meeting in Nice, France in December 2000, after which President Jacques Chirac declared: ""It's not normal to finish at five in the morning."" Two decades later, summitry European-style had hardly changed, with EU leaders squabbling over a massive recovery fund to lift the European economy. And it all began quite pleasantly. When the summit started on Friday morning, Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader, received gifts of an Austrian torte, a favourite French white burgundy wine and a silver flask of rose oil from Bulgaria. As the leaders removed their masks and sat down around a huge conference table in the European Council's Europa building, for a moment thoughts of recession or pandemic seemed far away. But, as a grumpy Dutch premier Mark Rutte remarked two days later at a summit low point: ""We're not here with the intention of meeting each other on our birthdays for the rest of our lives."" To be fair, he'd had a bad night, culminating with a harangue from a table-thumping French President Emmanuel Macron that caused him to worry the negotiations might collapse. The first round of talks had been cordial enough. Each leader delivered their vision of what was needed from Europe - or not - in an extra-large conference room usually reserved for EU-Africa summits, to allow for social distance. The next day, the leaders got down to business with a new blueprint for the 750 billion euro package that - if agreed -would be a pioneering moment for the European unity project. EU Council Chief Charles Michel hosted leaders in small groups or one-on-one on the terrace of his Europa Building HQ with its view over Brussels, lending the summit the air of a rooftop lounge. But there was no spritz and pretzels as matters became increasingly tense and Rutte more entrenched in his low-spending position and insistence on austere labour-market reform. ""We are at an impasse. It's very complicated, more complicated than expected,"" admitted Italy's Giuseppe Conte. As big powers France and Germany went into a duel with the ""Frugals"" - Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands -- the leaders of smaller neutral countries wandered off to buy chips. Belgium's Sophie Wilmes and Luxembourg's Xavier Bettel appeared on Twitter in a sunny and festive Brussels square, and again later with the Estonian prime minister in tow for the city's favourite snack. Hours later, the first clash. Macron, fed up with the Frugals' refusal to buckle, was said to have ordered his staff to prepare the presidential jet to take him home to Paris. Rutte, speaking to Dutch journalists, just shrugged it off and said he knew of no ultimatum. As the hours ticked on through more bilaterals on Saturday, tempers frayed. One diplomat complained that the ""Frugals"" were making behind-the-scenes warnings to the south that financial markets could react dangerously if they didn't cave. At a dinner, Macron, irritated by three days of fruitless discussion, denounced those who ""endanger the European project"" through ""selfishness"". Again he threatened to storm out of the negotiations, with French officials insisting Merkel was ready to leave too. In the summit room, Macron, according to witnesses, attacked Austria's Kurz for leaving the meeting to make a call and accused Rutte of behaving like former British leader David Cameron -- whose strategy ""ended badly"". At dawn on Monday, Kurz had his own take on Macron's aggressive stance. ""It's understandable that some people, when they don't get enough sleep, end up losing their cool,"" he said. At 6am, the leaders ended up with their package, but were perhaps left wondering - like Chirac, two decades ago -whether there was some better way to reach an EU deal. "
"FRANKFURT (Germany): Germany coach Joachim Loew, under fire after a 6-0 loss to Spain in the Nations League last month, achieved most major goals set in 2019 and has the support of the German Football Association (DFB), national team director Oliver Bierhoff said on Friday. During a virtual news conference after a DFB board meeting, Bierhoff defended the 60-year-old coach, in charge since 2006, and his changes to the team in the past two years. Bierhoff said Germany had reached next year's Euros, were in the highest Pot 1 for Monday's 2022 World Cup qualifying draw and had also stayed in the top section in the Nations League. ""These three major targets were met,"" Bierhoff said, adding that the national team's overhaul had progressed only in small steps due to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting games, training and match scheduling. ""For 2021 we want to play a successful Euros, play a successful World Cup qualification campaign and further develop the team,"" he said. ""I am confident we will master this situation. I strongly believe that."" The DFB earlier this week decided to stick with Loew through next year's Euros despite Germany suffering their worst defeat in a competitive game. Loew has been in charge for a Germany record of 14 years and led his country to their 2014 World Cup triumph. But they have exited the last three tournaments the 2018 World Cup and two consecutive Nations Leagues at the group stage despite team changes that included dropping world champions Thomas Mueller, Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng.

"MOSCOW: Moscow is expanding the list of European officials barred from entering Russia in response to the European Union's sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday. The move comes a day after Navalny, a longtime adversary of President Vladimir Putin, released a recording of a phone call he said he made to an alleged state security operative, who was identified by media as a member of a team that has reportedly trailed the politician for years. In the recording, the man indicated his involvement in covering up the supposed poisoning and revealed some details of the alleged operation. Last month, EU foreign ministers imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute over what German authorities said was poisoning in Russia with a nerve agent. In a statement Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry called the EU sanctions ``a confrontational political decision'' and announced that it was expanding ``the list of representatives of EU member states and institutions who will be denied entry to the Russian Federation.'' The Ministry didn't reveal either the names of the EU officials or the exact number who would be barred from Russia. But it did say that the list includes ``those who are responsible for promoting anti-Russian sanctions initiatives'' in the 27-member bloc. Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. On Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned German, French and Swedish ambassadors ``in connection to the introduction of the anti-Russian EU sanctions,'' Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the Interfax news agency. Last week, a joint investigation by the research group Bellingcat and several media outlets alleged that operatives from Russia's FSB domestic security agency followed Navalny during his trips since 2017. The investigation said the operatives ``specialized training in chemical weapons, chemistry and medicine,'' and some of them were ``in the vicinity'' of Navalny in the timeframe ``during which he was poisoned.'' Navalny, who is currently convalescing in Germany, said the report proved beyond doubt that FSB operatives tried to kill him on Putin's orders. The video of his phone call to one of the alleged operatives, dismissed by the FSB as a fake, received nearly 13 million views on YouTube 22 hours after it was posted. Russian authorities have repeatedly denied any involvement. Putin charged last week that the investigation relied on data provided by U.S. spy agencies and rejected the allegations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said that ``neither the Kremlin, nor anyone can speak definitively about some kind of poisoning,'' because Russia hasn't received any ``information'' to that effect from the three countries or the OPCW.

"BERLIN: ""Please help us leave!"" says a woman in a video shared online, one of dozens of passengers from Britain stranded in German airports on Sunday night. Countries around the world -- including Germany, France and Italy -- have begun banning flights and travellers from the UK after a new strain of coronavirus was detected there. British travellers still arriving in Germany on Sunday were prevented from leaving the airport, with health officials and nurses -- some dressed in hazmat suits -- administering immediate Covid-19 tests. These measures hit 63 people arriving in Hanover from Britain, who were kept overnight in the airport and will not be permitted to leave until they receive a negative test result -- expected Monday morning. In the meantime, the terminal's officials set up campbeds to help passengers spend the night. Among the detained travellers, the atmosphere was tense. ""We are at Hanover airport and we are held against our will, we were tested and were prohibited from leaving the premises while awaiting the results,"" said Manuela Thomys, in a video shared online by German daily Bild. Groups of people including a nine-month-old baby can be seen in the clip. ""Please help us leave!"" Thomys says. Local authorities have apologised for the inconvenience caused ahead of Christmas. ""Our aim is to prevent the new variant of the virus from entering the region,"" Hanover health official Andreas Kranz explained to German news wire DPA. Germany reported a record in daily new infections on Thursday, surpassing the 30,000 mark for the first time, and has recorded a total of 24,125 deaths. Scientists first discovered the new strain of the virus -- which they believe is 70 percent more transmissible -- in a patient in September. But alarm bells were set ringing across Europe last week as the strain appeared to be raging in parts of Britain. Europe last week became the first region in the world to pass 500,000 deaths from Covid-19 since the pandemic began a year ago. A spokeswoman for the World Health Organization told AFP that ""across Europe, where transmission is intense and widespread, countries need to redouble their control and prevention approaches."" "
"BERLIN: Germany is considering banning flights from Britain and South Africa to prevent the spread of new, more infectious coronavirus strain circulating in the two countries, a source close to the German health ministry told AFP on Sunday. Following the example of the Netherlands, where a ban on all passenger flights from the UK came into effect on Sunday, the German government was considering a similar move as ""a serious option"" for flights from both Britain and South Africa, the source said.

""We have arrested one person, one vehicle has been secured,"" police said, adding that a 51-year-old German suspect from the Trier area had been overpowered within minutes of the incident and was now being questioned, police said. Prosecutor Peter Fritzen later told a news conference the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol, and authorities were not working on the assumption that there was any Islamist militant motive to the incident. Trier mayor Wolfram Leibe said, ""It looks as if we are talking about a suspect with mental issues, but we should not pass premature judgement."" The interior minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, said four people had been killed, and four severely hurt people were among the injured. He said the route taken by the driver indicated he had carried out the act on purpose. Mayor Leibe said a nine-month-old baby was among the dead. ""We have a driver who ran amok in the city,"" he told public broadcaster SWR earlier. ""I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he said. He told broadcaster N-TV that people who saw the incident were ""totally traumatised"" and the street ""looks a bit like after a war"". The incident shocked residents of Germany's oldest town, founded by the Romans more than 2,000 years ago. The Trierischer Volksfreund quoted a witness as saying a Range Rover was driving at high speed and people had been thrown through the air. It said the car had Trier plates. Truck attackIt reported that people screamed in panic when the car drove through the street. Officers were scouring the area in search of evidence, backed by police dressed in flak jackets and carrying sub-machine guns. On the streets, Christmas lights twinkled incongruously. Germany has tightened security on pedestrian zones across the country since a truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people and injured dozens. In October 2019, a man opened fire on a synagogue in the city of Halle. After failing to get into the building he went on a rampage outside, killing two people. In February this year a racist gunman killed nine migrants in Hanau near Frankfurt before killing his mother and himself. Only about a week later, a local man ploughed his car into a carnival parade in the town of Volkmarsen, injuring 61. Germany has tightened measures to fight the coronavirus, with bars and restaurants closed, but shops and schools are still open. ""What happened in Trier is shocking. Our thoughts are with the relatives of the victims, with the numerous injured and with everyone who is currently on duty to care for the victims,"" Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, said on Twitter.

"BERLIN: Police raided homes in three German states early Tuesday after the German government banned a far-right group, a spokesman for the interior ministry said. The homes of 13 members of the far-right group Wolfbrigade 44 were searched in Hesse, Mecklenburg West-Pomerania and North Rhine-Westphalia to confiscate the group's funds and far-right propaganda material, the German news agency dpa reported. âWhoever fights against the basic values of our free society will get to feel the resolute reaction of our government,â Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said, according to his spokesman, Steve Alter. The group's goal is to re-establish a Nazi dictatorship, according to security officials. The 44 in their name stands for the fourth letter in the alphabet, DD, and is an abbreviation for Division Dirlewanger. Oskar Dirlewanger was a known Nazi war criminal and commander of a Nazi SS special unit. The far-right group was founded in 2016. It is known for possessing illegal weapons and members have participated in far-right protests. Earlier this year, the German government banned other far-right groups including the Combat 18 and the Nordadler, dpa reported. "
"LUCKNOW: The proposed mosque at Ayodhya's Dhannipur will be a modern structure and it will be energy efficient. The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) Trust released the artist's impression of the project spread over five acre land given to the trust as per the order of the Supreme Court. ""We will not take any symbolism or design element from the past or from the medieval times. The mosque's design is contemporary and it will be an energy efficient one. Subject to formal clearance of the plan, the project when put in full swing, will take only two years to completion,"" announced IICF Trust in Lucknow at a press conference on Saturday. As IICF tries to come out of the shadows of the demolished Babri Masjid, it now hopes to call not just people for prayer but also calls out towards a ""syncretic and modern"" future, the trust members said. 1/6Design of new Ayodhya mosque Previous NextShow CaptionsThe Indo Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) Trust on Saturday released the artist's impression of the proposed mosque at Dhannipur in AyodhyaThe proposed mosque at Ayodhya's Dhannipur will be a modern structure and it will be energy efficientThe mosque will come up on an area of over 1700 square meters, will be double storeyed with two contemporary designed minarets at its front and a skylit glass dome.

They clarified that there would be no grand foundation laying ceremony for the project since there is no such tradition in Islam. ""There is no particular design standard which is to be followed for a mosque in Islam. The arches and domes were an element of medieval architecture which stuck on. But architecture is ever evolving. Mosques now such as those in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Germany, Turkey, Pakistan and others have contemporary architecture. We are not creating a precedent,"" said Prof SM Akhar, founder dean of the faculty of architecture and ekistics at Jamia Millia Islamia, who joined the press conference online.

It will be solar powered and have a vibrant green patch with a variety of trees from across the globe. There are examples of such mosques the closest being the Badriya Juma Masjid in Karnataka which is the world's first eco-friendly green mosque,"" added president of the IICF and chief of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, Zufar Faruqi. While the trust has not come with a name of the mosque yet, it is amply clear of the fact that ""it would not be named after any king or emperor"" clarifying that the name Babri Masjid is out of the cards. ""There is a lot of work which remains before we can start work on the site. Soil testing is to be done, a blueprint accepted by the relevant authorities and only then can we begin. We want work to start from January 26 when the Indian Constitution came into effect. However, if not possible, we are sure that by August 15--Independence day--we will be all set to start,"" said trust spokesperson Athar Husain. Apart from the mosque, a much larger 200-bed super speciality hospital, a museum and archival centre, a library and community kitchen are also to come up on the allotted land. ""A hospital is the most important requirement of the area. Through our survey it was found that the women and children of the nearby areas are severely malnutritioned and in the absence of a hospital in the vicinity, patients are forced to rush to Lucknow, Gorakhpur or other cities,"" said Husain. ""We are gathering funds for the project currently and there are some donors for the hospital. Rough estimates tell that in a 200-bed super specialty hospital, Rs 50 lakhs per bed are required. The first phase will include the mosque and hospital and second phase will include hospital expansion,"" added Husain. "
"CHENNAI: India's no. 1 paddler Sharath Kamal is likely to leave for Germany to feature in the league where he will be turning up for Borussia Dusseldorf. The 38-year-old, ranked 32 in the world, was scheduled to leave for Germany once the national camp concluded earlier this month. However, visa issues meant that his trip got delayed. ""I am planning to leave for Germany on January 10. I need a visitor's visa to play there but the German embassy isn't issuing it currently due to the pandemic. However, with the intervention of the Sports Ministry and SAI (Sports Authority of India), I hope to get it,"" Sharath told TOI on Friday. With the TT Nationals scheduled to be held in February, Sharath will return to feature in it before heading back to Germany. ""The TT Senior Nationals is scheduled to be held at Sonepat in the second week of February. However, if they plan to hold it earlier then my Germany trip will have to be rescheduled,"" mentioned Sharath. He is keen to play in the Nationals for the much-needed match practice. ""The quality of games in the Nationals is quite high and I don't want to miss it. Also, I am playing in the German league only as a substitute player. So, I wouldn't know how many games I will get to play,"" Sharath pointed out. The plan is to come for the Nationals and then go back to train in Germany. ""I will want to spend some time there to train before the Tokyo Games,"" he said. Sharath was happy to practice and train with his teammates at the national camp in Sonepat. ""We were there for over 40 days. Before that, we were only training during the lockdown and the chance to play with other players was great. More importantly, the rush and feeling the pressure of playing a match was just fantastic,"" he said. "
"AMARAVATI: The crucial phase of fixing of hydraulic crest gates at Polavaram project began on Thursday. The irrigation department engineering officials and top officials of contractor firm Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (Meil) expedited the works following the CMâs visit to the project two days ago. Meil has imported 48 hydraulic cylinders from Germany and another 48 are likely to reach the project site next week. Speaking to media, project chief engineer B Sudhakar said that they have started fixing of arm girders which would be used to lift the crest gates of the project. While the project will have 48 gates, there would be eight arm girders to each gate. He said that another four horizontal girders would also be set up at each gate to facilitate smooth operation of the gates. The chief engineer said that the entire set of 12 girders at each gate would weigh around 31 tonnes. He said that 48 gates put together would have 384 arm girders and 192 horizontal girders. âWe have entered a key phase of the project as setting up of arm girders and horizontal girders would be an important task to fix the gates,â said the chief engineer. He said they would lift the skin plates of the gates with the help of arm girders. He said that arm girders would be the operational keys of the gates to lift and down. He said that arm girders were being set up by pre-stressing the true-union beams of the project. "
"BERLIN: Specialist labs in France and Sweden have confirmed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok, the German government said Monday. A German military laboratory previously confirmed the substance in his samples. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said that the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has also received samples and is taking steps to have those tested at its reference laboratories. ""Independently of the ongoing examinations by the OPCW, three laboratories have now confirmed independently of one another the proof of a nerve agent of the Novichok group as the cause of Mr. Navalny's poisoning,â Seibert said in a statement. He said Germany had asked France and Sweden for an âindependent reviewâ of the German findings using new samples from Navalny. Navalny, the most visible opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was flown to Germany two days after falling ill on August 20 on a domestic flight in Russia. Berlin has demanded that Russia investigate the case. Seibert on Monday renewed Germany's demand that âRussia explain itselfâ on the matter. He added that âwe are in close consultation with our European partners on further steps.â The Kremlin has bristled at calls from Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders for Russia to answer questions in the case, denying any official involvement and accusing the West of trying to smear Moscow. Russian authorities have prodded Germany to share the evidence that led it to conclude âwithout doubtâ that Navalny was poisoned with a military nerve agent from the Novichok group, the same class of Soviet-era agent that British authorities said was used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, England, in 2018. Berlin has rejected suggestions from Moscow that it is dragging its heels. Navalny was kept in an induced coma for more than a week as he was treated with an antidote, before hospital officials said a week ago that his condition had improved enough for him to be brought out of it. It isn't clear when Berlin's Charite hospital will next issue an update on his condition. "
"BERLIN: A video has emerged of Germany and Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer singing a Croatian song which has right-wing nationalist links while on holiday. In the filming, Neuer, 34, can be seen in a group at a beachside bar singing ""Lijepa li si"" (You are beautiful) by controversial Croatian singer Marko Perkovic, known as 'Thompson'. Perkovic, who is known for his sympathies for Croatia's World War II pro-Nazi regime, earned the nickname 'Thompson' after the brand of weapon he carried during the Croatian war of independence in the early 1990s. The song in question is a patriotic number that cites Herceg-Bosnia -- which Zagreb-backed Bosnian Croats self-proclaimed as a statelet during Bosnia's 1990s war and which they had hoped would eventually merge with Croatia. Neuer, who has led Germany since 2016, is holidaying with his friend and Bayern Munich goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic, 39, on the Dalmatian coast on the Adriatic Sea. Neuer has not yet commented on the video, but his personal manager told German daily Bild the player does not speak Croatian. A press officer from Bayern Munich declined to comment when contacted by AFP. Neuer's managers were not immediately available for comment. Magazine Focus noted Neuer was ""naive to think"" the clip would not emerge in the media. At the same time, ""assuming that with this song Neuer supports Croatian nationalist ideas would be a little too far-reaching"", it said. Having skippered Bayern to an eighth straight Bundesliga title before they also won the German Cup to complete the double, Neuer and his team-mate are currently on a two-week holiday. Bayern could finish this season with a treble of silverware as they are among the favourites for the Champions League finals in Lisbon next month. Bayern host Chelsea on August 8 in the last 16, second leg, having won the first leg 3-0 in London in February. "
"NEW DELHI: The government is all set to launch a âBrand Indiaâ mission, focused on the promotion of quality products that are manufactured in the country. The move, being piloted by the Piyush Goyal-led commerce and industry ministry, is based on similar policies in other countries, including the US, Switzerland, Germany and France, which regulate claims made to goods produced in their jurisdiction. The idea is linked to the extent of local production with countries such as Switzerland offering the tag to service sector companies if they are headquartered there. In case of food products, the requirement is 80% local production. Goyalâs plan, discussed with the Quality Council of India and other agencies last week, is looking at country of origin certificates, which will be voluntary with self-certification to be vetted by certain entities. It will be applicable to natural as well as manufactured goods. To be eligible for the tag, manufactured goods producers need to be registered in India and should comply with the prescribed health and safety standards. A minimum 20% local content is being discussed with the final assembly required in India. Sources said the entire certification process is proposed to be completed within six to 10 days of an application being filed, with monitoring expected to start after six months. Once a decision is taken, the mission can be launched in around a year with the initial plan to be tested through a few pilots. Those who opt for the scheme may be given recognition by the government emarketplace and other platforms, preference in public purchase and other benefits, including those under trade agreements, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI, adding that the plan is still to be firmed up. After the recent tension with China, the government has shifted to an Atmanirbhar Bharat strategy, where it is seeking to get Indian companies to be part of the global value chain, in addition to produce for the domestic market. Along with import curbs on some products such as TV sets and tyres, the Centre is also insisting on disclosing the country of origin of goods, especially in case of ecommerce. A host of products, from electronics to automobiles and defence equipment have been identified as potential focus areas. "
"MOSCOW: Russian police said on Friday they would ask Germany to allow their officers to question opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is being treated in Berlin for poisoning. The 44-year-old Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner became ill after boarding a plane in Siberia and was hospitalised there before being flown to Berlin. Germany claims there is ""unequivocal evidence"" that he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent but Russia says its doctors found no trace of any poison. The Siberian transport police, who have been retracing Navalny's movements, said in a statement that Russia would be preparing a request for its officers and an ""expert"" to shadow German investigators. The police said following reports that Navalny had emerged from a coma, officers could ""ask clarifying and additional questions"" and be present as ""German colleagues carry out investigative activities with Navalny, medics and experts"". The case has prompted international calls for Russia to carry out a transparent investigation or risk sanctions, but the country has not opened a criminal investigation because it says its medics did not find evidence of poison in tests. Siberian transport police have been conducting a ""check"" into what happened and on Friday published some findings on Navalny's activities. They said they had identified where Navalny stayed and ate and that he drank ""wine and an alcoholic cocktail"". They confirmed that he visited the ""Vienna Coffeehouse"" at the airport of the city of Tomsk where supporters suspect he was poisoned with a cup of tea. The police also said they had questioned all those accompanying Navalny except for one woman, Marina Pevchikh, who ""lives permanently in Britain"". They were now working to trace passengers on the flight from Tomsk to Moscow where Navalny fell ill on August 20, the statement said. Russia has repeatedly complained that Germany has not answered its request to see the medical data that led it to declare that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok nerve agent. Russian doctors nevertheless said they administered an antidote to nerve agents that was also used by doctors at the Berlin hospital now treating the anti-corruption campaigner. "
"ALGIERS: Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said Sunday he was recovering from the Covid-19 illness, in his first televised appearance since he was hospitalised in Germany almost two months ago. ""Thanks to God... I have started on the road to recovery,"" the 75-year-old said a day after the first anniversary of his election. ""It may take two or three weeks but, God willing, I will recover all my bodily strength."" The video was broadcast on state television and published on Tebboune's Twitter feed. He did not indicate his location, but his Twitter feed indicated that he was outside Algeria. Tebboune, a heavy smoker, was hospitalised in Germany on October 28, and Algerian authorities later announced that he had the Covid-19 illness. His absence had sparked concerns of an institutional crisis, weeks after voters approved a revised constitution on record low turnout in a referendum widely seen as a manoeuvre to neutralise the long-running Hirak protest movement. Tebboune has been unable to sign the revised constitution into law because he must be on Algerian soil to do so. He also has until December 31 to sign off on a 2021 budget. But he said Sunday he was following developments in Algeria ""day by day, if not hour by hour"", and noted progress in cutting the country's daily toll of coronavirus infections. Visibly thinner than before and wearing a casual jacket, he sat at a desk next to an Algerian flag. Tebboune won last year's widely boycotted December 12 presidential election, following months of mass protests that had swept his predecessor Abdelaziz Bouteflika from office. Tebboune's prolonged disappearance had reminded many Algerians of Bouteflika's frequent hospitalisations abroad. Last month's constitutional referendum, timed to coincide with Algeria's 1962 independence from France, had been seen as a bid to boost Tebboune's legitimacy. But with the president overseas and the Hirak urging a boycott, the vote saw even lower turnout than the election that brought Tebboune to power. His absence came as Algeria faces a sharp recession due to the coronavirus pandemic and a gaping budget deficit due to low crude prices that have slashed the country's vital oil revenues. Tebboune has promised to fight for a ""strong and diversified"" economy and work to wean the country off oil. He vowed Sunday that ""no citizen on a low income will be hit by new taxes."" Tebboune has also reached out to the ""blessed"" Hirak, which staged over a year of mass protests until it was forced to suspend them amid coronavirus restrictions earlier this year. But his administration has overseen a crackdown on dissent. Prisoners' rights group the CNLD says around 90 activists, social media users and journalists are currently in custody, mostly for social media posts. ""Tebboune could have created legitimacy, launching large projects of political, economic and institutional renewal,"" Charef said. ""But he has not been able to, or has not known how."" "
"Kochi: The French Ambassador to India expressed his expectations that Kerala might come up with innovative, eco-friendly and gender-oriented projects that could attract funding from the EU. Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain was visiting the various projects that are being funded by France and Germany in Kerala, along with the German Ambassador Walter J Lindner and EU Ambassador Ugo Astuto, at the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement. âEvery year the French and the German Developmental Agencies select and finance new projects of roughly 300 million Euro. Given the quality of projects here, we are confident that Kerala will come forward with new projects which are the most innovative, eco-friendly and gender-oriented,â said Lenain in Kochi on Saturday. The sixth India-EU Summit held in New Delhi in 2005 had endorsed a Joint Action Plan clean development and climate change are part of the common shared goals. Hence the joint projects include CDSC (clean development and sustainable cities), which is focusing on cities to bring down pollution. âThe EU has one year ago taken the decision to be carbon neutral by 2050. It is an important commitment and we have just adopted more stringent decisions for this. India is also supportive of the Paris agreement. So, we are here to showcase a very good example of the project for which France, Germany and EU are coming together with India to bring down the emissions,â ambassador Astuto said. âIt is a special day because it is the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Paris [Climate] Agreement. Kerala, and Kochi in particular, is a very special place for environmental protection. You are doing a good job, which starts with while arriving at the airport, which is the only airport in the world which is powered fully by solar energy,â said Lindner. The envoys had highlighted the eco-friendly project of water metro, powered by solar energy and the e-rickshaws and e-buses which offer last mile connectivity for the Kochi Metro. "
"BERLIN: Germany on Sunday increased pressure on Russia over the poisoning of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, warning that a lack of support by Moscow in the investigation could âforceâ Germany to rethink the fate of a German-Russian gas pipeline project. âI hope the Russians won't force us to change our position regarding the Nord Stream 2"" pipeline being built under the Baltic Sea, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told weekly Bild am Sonntag. Maas also said, âIf there won't be an contributions from the Russian side regarding the investigation in the coming days, we will have to consult with our partners.â He did not exclude possible punishments against Russia, telling the newspaper that âif we think about sanctions, they should be pinpointed effectively"". However, Maas also admitted that halting the building of the nearly completed gas pipeline would harm German and European companies. âWhoever demands this has to be aware of the consequences,â he said. âMore than 100 companies from 12 European countries are involved (in the construction), about half of them from Germany.â The German government has come under growing pressure to use the joint German-Russian pipeline project as leverage in getting Russia to provide answers on Navalny. The Nord Stream 2 project would deliver Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea when completed, bypassing Ukraine. Navalny, a Kremlin critic and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight to Moscow last month and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk. He has been in an induced coma in a Berlin hospital since he was flown to Germany for treatment on August 22. German authorities have said that tests showed that he had been poisoned with a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group. British authorities previously identified the nerve agent, developed during the Soviet era, as the poison used on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018. âWe have high expectations from the Russians to bring light into this severe crime,â Maas said. âIf they have nothing to do with this attack then it's in their own interest to put the facts on the table.â President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has brushed off allegations that the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Navalny and said last week that Germany hadn't provided Moscow with any evidence about the politician's condition. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Navalny's poisoning an attempted murder that aimed to silence one of Putin's fiercest critics and called for a full investigation. Merkel personally offered the country's assistance in treating Navalny. He's now in stable condition at Berlin's Charite hospital, but doctors expect a long recovery and haven't ruled out that the 44-year-old could face long-term effects to his health. Merkel has previously rejected the idea that the Navalny case should be linked to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The US has long opposed the project, which has been increasingly a source of friction between Berlin and Washington. In early August, three Republican senators threatened sanctions against an operator of a Baltic Sea port located in Merkel's parliamentary constituency over its part in Nord Stream 2. The Mukran port is a key staging post for ships involved in its construction. The US argues the project will endanger European security by making Germany overly dependent on Russian gas. It's also opposed by Ukraine and Poland, which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the Baltic, as well as some other European nations. In addition to the security concerns, the US also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe. (AP) "
"MOSCOW: Russia on Sunday accused Germany of stalling efforts to probe opposition politician Alexei Navalny's case after Berlin demanded Moscow provide an explanation over his poisoning or face sanctions. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused German authorities of failing to respond to a request by Russian prosecutors sent on August 27. She spoke after German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Russia must soon provide an explanation over Navalny's poisoning with Novichok, a banned nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union. ""Dear Mr Maas, if the German government is sincere in its statements then it should be interested in preparing a response to a request of the Russian Prosecutor General's Office as soon as possible,"" Zakharova said. ""So far we are not certain that Germany is not playing a double game,"" she added. ""Where is the 'urgency' you are insisting upon? ""By not sending its answer, Berlin is stalling the process of investigation for which it's calling. On purpose?"" Germany, the current head of the European Union, will discuss possible sanctions on Russia over the poisoning of Russian President Vladimir Putin's top foe if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, Maas said Sunday. Navalny fell ill on a flight last month and was treated in a Siberian hospital before being evacuated to Berlin. Germany said last week there was ""unequivocal evidence"" that the Russian opposition leader had been poisoned using Novichok. ""If in the coming days Russia does not help clarify what happened, we will be compelled to discuss a response with our allies,"" Maas told German daily Bild. Any sanctions decided should be ""targeted"", he added. Western leaders and many Russians have expressed horror at what Navalny's allies say is the first known use of chemical weapons against a high-profile opposition leader on Russian soil. Earlier this week Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had ""nothing to hide"" and the Kremlin said Russian doctors had found no proof Navalny was poisoned. "

"NEW DELHI: Fresh daily Covid cases in India fell below the 30,000-mark on Thursday for the third time since July 13, continuing with the declining trend of pandemic that is being seen consistently since its peak on September 17. This is the first time since July 13 when daily cases have fallen below 30,000 on a day other than Monday, when the number of infections are low because of low testing during the weekend. The previous two occasions when the infections breached the 30,000-mark were Mondays â December 7 and November 16. Despite this consistent fall, India is still the worldâs third largest contributor of daily Covid cases. According to the latest figures provided by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, US tops the chart with 2.2 lakh cases and Brazil is a distant second with over 50,000 cases. Russia and Germany are world number four and five after India. With 29,497 fresh cases on Thursday, Indiaâs Covid caseload has reached 97,97,150. While total recoveries have reached 92,89,743, actives cases went down by nearly 9,000 to 3,65,229. With 4,470 new cases, Kerala topped the list of states and was followed by Maharashtra which reported 3,824 cases. West Bengal was at the third slot with 2801 cases. Delhi, that had reported 2,463 cases on Wednesday, saw a decline of 888 cases and with 1575 new cases on Thursday, it was pushed to number six in the list of states with maximum daily cases. "
"GENEVA: With most of Switzerland preparing for tighter lockdown restrictions because of Covid-19, the region of Geneva is going in the other direction â allowing restaurants to reopen on Thursday after a drop in cases from one of the world's highest rates of infection roughly a month ago. Authorities in the Geneva canton, or region, that includes the city of the same name confirmed on Monday the ""strict conditions"" for the reopening of eateries, just days after Swiss national authorities announced plans to tighten measures designed to fight the coronavirus. On Tuesday, after an urgent session of the Swiss federal executive body, health minister Alain Berset announced a proposal â to be discussed with the regions to require the closure of shops, restaurants, gyms and other businesses open to the public no later than 7pm every night. A day earlier, in a statement, Geneva regional authorities said ""establishments must close their doors no later than 11 pm"" â suggesting a disconnect that may well require compromise or concession. Geneva authorities say a maximum of four people can sit at a table and 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) of distance must be ensured between tables. Restaurateurs must require mask wearing and provide disinfectant gel at their entrances. ""Ambiance music"" must be limited to no louder than 75 decibels. In late October and early November, the Geneva region of about 500,000 people that houses the headquarters of the World Health Organization recorded over 1,000 new cases per day on seven separate days. On November 1, with the main university hospital complex getting flooded with new Covid-19 cases, Geneva ordered restaurants shut. Now, the region has generally been recording 100 to 200 cases over the past two weeks, hitting as low as 51 on December 6 â the lowest one-day tally in two months. Under its federal and cantonal system of government, Switzerland grants great leeway to the regions to set their own policies â and in this case, Geneva is breaking with the trend of stiffer nationwide restrictions. Swiss authorities have sought to strike a balance between more stringent anti-Covid measures in neighboring countries like France, Germany and Italy â hoping to limit economic fallout and rely on individual responsibility through physical distancing, hand hygiene and other prevention measures.

"BERLIN: Germany head coach Joachim Loew has spoken out against the ""insane"" fixture list his stars face this season on top of his German team playing eight internationals in a dense schedule until the end of November. Germany will twice play three games in six days in October, then November. ""I don't agree with that, it upsets me,"" said Loew after Thursday's 1-1 draw against Spain in Stuttgart in the Nations League. ""The fixture list is insanely full,"" Loew added. Germany play a friendly and two Nations League matches, with two days break between each game this October and November. ""We have to be careful. I have always said that the health of the players is paramount. ""If you don't pay attention, we'll have big problems in March, April and May,"" Loew warned with the postponed Euro 2020 finals in June, a knock-on effect after last season was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Loew acknowledged that the German Football Association needs the television revenue from home friendlies against Turkey on October 7 and the Czech Republic on November 11. ""I also represent the interests of the association. And the association is happy about the income."" Loew rested many of his Bayern Munich players for Thursday's draw with Spain and Sunday's Nations League away match against Switzerland. However, Bayern stars like Serge Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka and Manuel Neuer face a punishing schedule this season for club and country. They face the prospect of playing 57 competitive matches for Bayern alone in 2020/21. Loew is also annoyed that unlike in the Champions League, European football's governing body UEFA has not raised the maximum number of substitutions allowed from three to five for internationals. ""If not now, then when?,"" asked Loew. ""One would have thought that five changes would make sense. ""Just now it would have needed that. ""Some players are running on empty and that's when injuries happen."" Spain head coach Luis Enrique agreed. ""I regret that I couldn't make five substitutions, then I could have given the players more rest,"" he said. Germany midfielder Julian Draxler does not expect UEFA to react by helping their cause in an unprecedented season. ""As players, we have little influence there,"" said the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, who only had two training sessions with Germany before 90 minutes against Spain. ""I also think it makes sense to have the five changes because we come from different (fitness) levels. ""It's also risky to play 90 minutes when you've only trained twice."" Loew said he will give his players some rest before facing the Swiss on Sunday and insisted his focus is on next year's postponed Euro 2020 finals, not the Nations League. ""Some players are really flat - we can't do much more training for the next two days,"" added Loew. ""And I have to be honest, the results in the Nations League are not that important to me. ""We can only win something,"" he added referring to the Euro finals, ""if the team is mentally and physically fit."" "
"NEW DELHI: India is well-positioned geo-economically and geopolitically to create and provide globally-skilled workforce, an official of the Ministry of External Affairs said on Wednesday. Addressing the 9th Global Summit on Skill Development, MEA Secretary (CPV & OIA) Sanjay Bhattacharyya said India stands ready to improve the presence of highly-skilled workers and professionals through mutually-beneficial arrangements with Europe, the US and Japan. Today's world is characterised by globalisation that thrives on mobility of global talent. Specialisation, domain-specific knowledge and skills are key to success and will also determine employability of the youth, who form India's demographic dividend and an advantage the country shall have into the second half of 21st century, according to Bhattacharyya. Speaking on 'The Future of Work -- Creating Globally Competitive Skilled Workforce' the senior MEA official said India was well-positioned in traditional labour markets in the Gulf and Europe. ""India's success story in the Gulf is well-known and there are over 9 million Indian workers and professionals in these countries,"" he said. ""The leadership in the Gulf has acknowledged their contribution to the development of the region and Indians are the preferred option for Gulf countries."" Noting that India's share in the European labour market has also shown positive signs, Bhattacharyya said a recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation (OECD) study revealed that of the 12 crore migrants living in OECD countries, 30-35 per cent were highly-educated with academic and vocational training. India was ranked at the top with more than 3 lakh highly-educated Indians in the OECD countries, which is reflective of the skilled and trained workforce that India possesses, he said. Bhattacharyya said the signing of the India-EU Declaration of Common Agenda on Migration and Mobility in 2016 affirmed the shared objectives of better organising and promoting regular migration at all levels, maximising the development impact of migration and mobility for mutual benefit. ""We are also working to provide enabling frameworks through Migration and Mobility Partnerships. While the agreement has been concluded with France, agreements with Portugal, Germany, Benelux, UK and Japan (outside EU) are in the pipeline,"" he said, adding that several other countries were also interested in such agreements. ""India stands ready to improve the presence of highly skilled workers and professionals through mutually beneficial arrangements with Europe, the US and Japan,"" Bhattacharyya said. ""India is well-positioned geo-economically and geo-politically to create and provide globally skilled workforce due to our competitive advantage, the English language, and strong core skills in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects,"" he said. Strengthening English and other business language programmes like German, Spanish, French or Japanese will ensure greater mobility, employability and readiness to join the global workforce, he asserted.

"BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel faced pressure on Thursday to use a joint German-Russian pipeline project as leverage in getting Russia to provide answers about the poisoning of the Kremlin's most determined critic. After German authorities said Wednesday that tests showed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent, Merkel called the attack a murder attempt and demanded Moscow's cooperation. ``There are very serious questions now that only the Russian government can answer, and must answer,'' Merkel said. The chancellor said Germany would work with the European Union and NATO allies on a joint response. The opposition Green party said that should include an end to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would deliver Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic when completed. ``The apparent attempted murder by the mafia-like structures of the Kremlin can no longer just give us cause for concern, it must have real consequences,'' Green parliamentary group leader Katrin Goering-Eckardt said. The Greens have long opposed the pipeline. The project with Russia also divides opinion in other camps. Norbert Roettgen, a lawmaker in Merkel's party who chairs parliament's foreign affairs committee, said that ``diplomatic rituals are no longer enough.'' ``After the poisoning ... we need a strong European answer, which (hash)Putin understands'' Roettgen tweeted. ``The EU should jointly decide to stop (hash)NordStream2.'' In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said calls to abandon Nord Stream 2 were ``emotional statements... not based on facts.'' He called the pipeline ``an international commercial project that is in the interests of Russia, Germany and the entire European continent.'' Peskov once again brushed off allegations of Russian government's involvement in Navalny's poisoning and urged German authorities to provide evidence to Russia. ``We haven't received any information so far. We hope that it will happen soon and will help figure out what caused the condition the patient is in right now,'' Peskov said. Navalny fell ill on a flight to Moscow on Aug. 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing. He was moved two days later to Berlin's Charite hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated Navalny had been poisoned. On Wednesday, the German government said that testing by a German military laboratory showed ``proof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group.'' British authorities identified Novichok as the poison used on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. Navalny remains in an induced coma in the hospital. Doctors said that while his condition was improving, the politician and anti-corruption investigator faces a long recovery and long-term effects cannot be ruled out. Despite Merkel's strong reaction to the news, it was not clear whether she would consider trying to put an end to the pipeline project. After doctors in Berlin reported last week that Navalny had likely been poisoned, Merkel rejected the idea of abandoning the project. Merkel said the pipeline should be completed and that she did not ``think it is appropriate to link this business-operated project with the Navalny question.'' Merkel also rejected the idea when it was floated after previous confrontations with Moscow over incidents closer to home - like evidence the chancellor's parliamentary office had been hacked by Russia and the killing of a Georgian man in downtown Berlin that prosecutors alleged was a hit ordered by the Russian state. Merkel also steadily resisted pressure from the United States to end the project, which Washington says will endanger European security by making Germany overly dependent on Russian gas. Nord Stream 2 is also opposed by Ukraine and Poland, which will be bypassed by the pipeline under the Baltic sea, as well as some other European nations. In addition to the security concerns, the U.S. also wants to sell more of its own liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Germany, which has Europe's largest economy. Last month, three Republican U.S. senators threatened sanctions against a German port operator involved in the project, prompting Germany's foreign minister to bring up the issue with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Switzerland-based Allseas, which operates ships laying sections of the undersea pipeline, suspended its work in December after U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation threatening sanctions against companies linked to the project. Despite the calls from some to bring Nord Stream 2 into the Navalny case, others have spoken against such a move. Wolfgang Kubicki, deputy leader of the pro-business Free Democratic Party, warned that Nord Stream 2 is nearing completion and both Russian and German companies are massively invested in the project. ``I'm skeptical that we should question a project of this magnitude at this stage,'' he told Deutschlandfunk radio. And Markus Soeder, a Merkel ally who leads the smallest party in Germany's governing coalition, said the construction of the pipeline was a private business decision, not the government's. ``In our view, one has nothing to do with the other,`` he said.

"BENGALURU: Testing only people â and their contacts â who had travel history to Covid-19-affected countries in the initial months of the pandemic allowed the virus to spread, according to a report. The report titled âCovid-19 in India - models, mysteries, myths, miracles, mistakes and moving forwardâ, prepared by three prominent researchers, suggests the virus may have spread through potentially infected people who went untested in the initial days. The study, which tracks the countryâs pandemic management over the past 10 months, is coauthored by Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru; Gautam I Menon, professor, physics and biology, Ashoka University, Sonepat and Dr Bhramar Mukherjee, professor and chair, biostatistics who also teaches at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, USA. It says the Centre's repeated denials on community spread only caused damage. âThis meant testing was, in the initial months, restricted only to international travellers returning from Covid-19-affected countries and their contacts and not anyone who reported symptoms of Covid,â the report states. Menon told TOI several potential carriers could have slipped under the radar because of the flawed testing policy. Not tested, isolatedâThe government's denial posed a problem until ICMR said anyone with influenzalike-illness or severe acute respiratory infection could be tested for Covid,â Menon said. âUntil April, possible carriers were not isolated.â Dr Babu said the overall response to the pandemic would have been much better had the government been open about community transmission. âStill, the Indian government did well compared to the US and UK, although those countries are ranked better in pandemic preparedness,â said Dr Babu. The report highlights many aspects of the fight against the virus, detailing how authorities ramped up testing from 300 tests a day to more than a million. It also looks at the comparatively lower death rate per million in India, as against other countries. As on November 29, India had 99 deaths per million, whereas UK had 840, Brazil 806, US 790 and Germany186. The report suggests several possible reasons for the low fatality rate such as a relatively younger population, compulsory child vaccination and a stronger immune system. âBut there is no strong evidence to prove any of these,â said Menon. The authors say any perceived innate advantage to the South Asian population is illusory and arises from inaccurate counting of deaths. âThere is evidence that medical certification of the cause of death, limited even before the pandemic, led to many deaths being misclassified,â the report states. The authors say a better measure of mortality could have been obtained by estimating the excess deaths when compared to general mortality in non-Covid years and comprehensive historical death data where available. Pointing out that medical certification of death is necessary to establish cause, Dr Babu said, âThat does not mean there is misclassification of Covid deaths only. This could be true of other deaths attributed falsely to Covid. It can cut both ways. The report is a commentary based on our inferences. It will be published soon in a journal.â "
"BERLIN: Germany said Wednesday that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, the same type of chemical used in Britain against ex-double agent Sergei Skripal, dramatically ramping up tensions with Moscow. Tests carried out by the German army on Navalny, who is being treated in a Berlin hospital, have provided ""unequivocal evidence of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok family,"" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement. ""It is a shocking event that Alexei Navalny has become the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia. ""The government condemns this attack in the strongest terms. The Russian government is urgently requested to provide clarifications over the incident,"" he added. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany had called in Russia's ambassador to demand answers on the case. Navalny, 44, fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia last month. He was initially treated in a local hospital before being flown to Berlin for treatment. The nerve agent Novichok is a military-grade poison that was developed by the Soviet government towards the end of the Cold War and can be deployed in an ultra-fine powder, liquid or vapour. The Charite hospital last week reported ""some improvement"" in Navalny's condition but he nevertheless remains in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator. The severity of the poisoning meant that it was too early to determine potential long-term effects, the hospital warned. Charite doctors said they believed the anti-corruption campaigner was poisoned with a substance that inhibits the cholinesterase enzyme, a feature of nerve agents. The case has drawn parallels with two suspected Kremlin-linked poisonings in Britain. In 2006, President Vladimir Putin was blamed for the radiation poisoning death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in the British capital. In 2018, the Kremlin was also accused of being behind the attempted murder of ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, southwest England, using a Novichok nerve agent. ""Only the state (FSB, GRU) can use Novichok. This is beyond any reasonable doubt,"" Ivan Zhdanov, the director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on Twitter on Wednesday, referring to the FSB internal security and GRU military intelligence services. The German government said it would inform NATO and EU partners over its findings and seek a joint reaction on the case. Navalny's allies say he may have been poisoned by a cup of tea he drank at Tomsk airport in Siberia. But the Russian doctors who first treated Navalny said their tests did not find any toxic substances, and the Kremlin has rejected international calls for an investigation. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agency Ria Novovsti that Russia had not been informed about the German government's latest findings. Russia has for years drawn the anger of Western powers, from annexing Ukraine's Crimea to meddling in elections and backing Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has walked a fine line, stressing the importance of dialogue with Putin while making clear her disapproval of Russian moves on the world stage. But Navalny's poisoning could further fray already tattered ties, coming after a murder in a central Berlin park in August last year which German prosecutors believe was ordered by Russia. Merkel had also revealed in May that Russia had targeted her in hacking attacks, saying she had concrete proof of the ""outrageous"" spying attempts. "
"MONACO: Germany striker Kevin Volland has left Bayer Leverkusen to sign a four-year contract with AS Monaco, the French Ligue 1 side announced on Wednesday, in a deal worth around 11 million euros ($13 million). As Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz hinted on Monday, the 28-year-old leaves the club after scoring 50 goals, creating 32 more, in 148 appearances over four years for the Bundesliga side. This is the first time Volland has joined a club outside Germany. He will link up with Monaco's new German-born head coach Niko Kovac, the former Croatian international who was sacked by Bayern Munich last November, but earned his first Ligue 1 victory on Sunday with a 1-0 win over Metz. Volland has also made 10 appearances for Germany, scoring a goal in the 8-0 drubbing of minnows San Marino in 2016. ""His profile is that of a versatile striker, capable of playing up front, as a second striker or a winger on both sides,"" Monaco's sporting director Paul Mitchell told the club's website. ""He is a player who works hard for the team with statistics that illustrate his goalscoring skills."" According to a club source, the transfer fee is 11 million euros with various added bonuses. Volland, formerly of Hoffenheim, is Monaco's second major signing of the transfer window after the arrival of promising centre-back Axel Disasi from Reims. Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes praised Volland's ""exemplary commitment"" over the last four years and said the striker leaves with the German club's blessing. Leverkusen are also poised to lose Germany playmaker Kai Havertz, 21, who is expected to join Chelsea in the coming days in a transfer deal estimated to be worth 100 million euros. "
"BERLIN: Germany fans want to show national team coach Joachim Loew a red card with former players also suggesting the 60-year-old should step aside amid the fall-out of their historic thrashing in Spain. Loew's Germany offered little resistance as they were trounced 6-0 in Tuesday's Nations League tie. It was the Germans' heaviest competitive defeat, matching a 6-0 friendly defeat to Austria in 1931. Loew held crisis talks with German FA president Fritz Keller in Munich on Wednesday, but with two years left on his contract, he is expected to coach Germany through to next June's European championships. However, in a survey commissioned by AFP subsidiary SID, 84.0 percent of 1,100 German fans asked want Loew and team director Oliver Bierhoff to step aside. Just 13.3 percent want to stick with the pair, who masterminded Germany's 2014 World Cup triumph. Either Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp or Bayern Munich boss Hansi Flick - Loew's assistant coach at Brazil 2014 - are the candidates German fans most want to see take over. More than two years after the 2018 World Cup when Germany failed to get out of their group, the historic rout by Spain was the latest set-back for Loew's side. Lothar Matthaeus, who captained West Germany to the 1990 World Cup title, says Loew should have stepped down in 2014. After 14-years as Germany coach, Loew ""seems weary. His public statements are no longer confident as they were - and his team reflects that on the field,"" said Matthaeus. After 3-3 draws against Switzerland and Turkey already this season, Matthaeus says defeat to Spain was just part of Germany's downward trend. ""It's the overall picture that is most alarming."" Former Liverpool and Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann says Loew's team lacks leaders. ""He always had outstanding teams and players who solved problems inside the dressing room on their own. Now he seems helpless,"" Hamann told Sky. ""He feels that he is no longer reaching the team as he did perhaps three years ago. ""And if this is the case, the problems are deeper than everyone wants to admit."" Hamann says the German FA are now paying the price for presenting Loew with an improved contract extension just before the Russia 2018 finals. ""It was complacent that before the 2018 World Cup, no thought was given to the idea that something could go wrong and Loew's contract was extended."" "
"BERLIN: A premature troop withdrawal from Afghanistan may complicate peace talks between the government in Kabul and the Taliban, German foreign minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday, commenting on US plans to pull out 2,000 troops from the country. ""It remains very important for us not to jeopardize what we have reached so far by taking any rash actions,"" Maas said. The German government is in touch with Washington and the Nato alliance and is looking into what consequences the US withdrawal would have for the around 1,200 German troops still deployed in Afghanistan as part of a larger Nato mission, he said. ""We are especially concerned how the US announcement will affect the peace talks for Afghanistan,"" Maas said, adding that the negotiations were already complicated enough and by far not completed. ""In this situation, we should not establish additional hurdles that a premature withdrawal from Afghanistan would certainly bring."" "
"BERLIN: Germany coach Joachim Loew faces the biggest crisis of his 14-year reign after his side were thrashed by Spain, with former players and the media questioning Wednesday whether he should lead the team into next year's European championship finals. The 6-0 drubbing in Seville on Tuesday was Germany's heaviest defeat for 89 years as Spain completely dominated the Nations League match in Seville. The Bild daily was blunt in its assessment, headlining its coverage: ""Loew should offer to resign."" ""Just seven months before the Euro, the German FA has to answer the question whether Joachim Loew is still the right man for the tournament,"" the paper said. Ferran Torres scored a brilliant hat-trick as Spain attacked at will with Loew's Germany side offering little resistance as they slumped to their heaviest defeat since losing 6-0 in Berlin against Austria in 1931. Loew batted off questions about his future in the post-match press conference. ""You have to ask others. I can't answer that spontaneously,"" he replied when asked if he was worried about his job. Loew led Germany to the 2014 World Cup but the credit from that triumph was largely dissipated by the debacle at the 2018 finals in Russia when Germany crashed out in the group phase. Loew's contract with the German federation runs until the 2022 World Cup and he appears to still have the support of Germany team director Oliver Bierhoff. ""The confidence is completely there,"" Bierhoff insisted in the wake of the drubbing, but promised a ""hard analysis"". Bierhoff pointed to a lineup on Tuesday containing veteran players Manuel Neuer, Ilkay Gundogan and Toni Kroos as proof that ""lack of experience of the players is no excuse"". Bastian Schweinsteiger, who won the 2014 World Cup under Loew, was horrified by the performance. ""It did not feel like a team - there were no commands"" in the German ranks, said the 36-year-old, who now works as a media pundit. ""You only heard the Spanish talking. You have to change something. The German national team can't play like that. ""There are certain values, which I didn't see on the pitch."" Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the humiliation in Spain must fuel the debate ""How much longer with Jogi Loew?"". ""The fiasco in Seville will obviously have consequences,"" said Cologne-based Express. ""Is Joachim Loew still the right coach for the national team?"" Schweinsteiger reignited the debate about whether three other veteran players who Loew has sidelined from the national team -- Mats Hummels and Bayern Munich's Champions League-winning pair Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller -- should be reinstated. Loew told all three in 2019 that their Germany careers were over, yet the trio are all currently in great form for their clubs. ""This is the German team, it has to bring together the best players,"" Schweinsteiger said, adding that Mueller and Boateng would be in his team for Euro 2020 if he were coach. ""The coach has his own opinion on this, I have a different one,"" he added. Even Neuer, the team's captain and goalkeeper whose record 96th international appearance was one he will want to forget, hinted the trio should return. ""I do not want to highlight any of the three named: all players could help us in principle, they have proven that often enough,"" Neuer told Sport Bild magazine. Time is running out for Loew to prove he can turn things around before the Euro 2020 finals, postponed from last year, kick-off in June. ""The path that the national coach has taken, I will follow up to and including the European Championship,"" Bierhoff told the Frankfurt newspaper FAZ. "
"BERLIN: Germany, planning to have an overhauled and tournament-ready team at next year's European soccer championships, are running out of time, with coach Joachim Loew's changes so far failing to deliver. A 6-0 demolition by Spain on Tuesday was their heaviest defeat in almost 90 years and only added to their fluctuating form in recent months. Nations League: Stunning Spain hit Germany for six as Giroud stars in France's winLoew brushed the defeat off as a ""disastrous day"" but the coach, in his 14th year in charge, has now seen his team exit in the first round of a tournament for the third straight time. Winners of the 2014 World Cup, Germany crashed out in the tournament group stage four years later. They were then relegated from the Nations League competition a few months later after failing to win a single game and eventually stayed up only thanks to a rule change. That exit prompted the start of Loew's overhaul as he dropped several world champions - including Thomas Mueller, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels - in favour of younger players. Loew to stay on as Germany coach despite loss to Spain: BierhoffBut their loss to Spain meant they are again out of the Nations League competition from the group stage. ""We saw today that we are not as far down the road as we had hoped to be,"" Loew said of his team's dismal performance against the Spaniards. ""After the first goal we just gave up being organised. That was deadly. We charged out and just opened up all the spaces. We forgot about our game plan and just ran around out there."" With falling TV figures, mounting criticism and Loew's refusal to recall Boateng and Thomas Mueller, who won five titles this year with Bayern Munich, and Hummels, the coach has worked himself in a corner. Germany will next play again in March before a few more warm-up matches prior to the tournament start in June. With a large pool of players to chose from but without a finetuned core of starting players, the overhaul that started in 2018, is still largely a construction site seven months before the tournament. ""I have faith in my players,"" Loew said. ""Now our responsibility is to question everything and question ourselves as well. We have to draw the right conclusions."" "
"SEVILLE (Spain): Joachim Loew admitted it was a ""black day"" for Germany after their 6-0 drubbing against Spain in the Nations League piled pressure on the team's coach. Ferran Torres scored a hat-trick as Spain ran riot in Seville, leaving Loew to pick through the wreckage of Germany's worst defeat for 89 years. ""This has been a black day for us,"" admitted Loew after Germany's heaviest defeat since losing 6-0 to Austria in Berlin in 1931. Nations League: Stunning Spain hit Germany for six as Giroud stars in France's win""We completely lost track of our plan after we went 1-0 down, which was deadly and the Spanish took their chances. Nothing worked, neither in defence nor attack. We left huge spaces, there was a lack of communication between the players."" The thrashing was double that of Loew's previous worst defeat as Germany coach, when his side lost by 3-0 to both the Czech Republic in 2007 and to the Netherlands in 2018.

Loew to stay on as Germany coach despite loss to Spain: BierhoffThe 60-year-old, who led Germany to the 2014 World Cup title, insists he can still turn things around with seven months to go before the European Championships kick off in June. Germany face France and Portugal, the reigning world and European champions, in their group. ""Of course,"" Loew insisted when asked if he wants to stay on, with two years left on his German FA contract. ""It's our duty to look at this and ask what we can do better.

Nations League: Stunning Spain hit Germany for six as Giroud stars in France's winGermany have hit a rough patch this year, winning only three of their last eight matches, but Bierhoff said Loew would remain in charge at least until the Euros next year. When asked if Loew would remain the coach until next year's Euros, Bierhoff told ARD TV: ""Absolutely, yes. This game changes nothing. We still trust Joachim Loew, no doubt about that. ""With the national team, you have to think and analyse from tournament to tournament. We want to achieve the maximum at next year's Euros."" The Euros were originally scheduled for June-July this year but the tournament was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dortmund raised their tempo and equalised with a superb strike from 18-year-old US forward Giovanni Reyna, but they failed to breach the Frankfurt defence again despite finishing the stronger. ð Sebastian Kehl:âWe saw two different halves.

Gladbach went ahead when Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted with an excellent first-time shot on 23 minutes. Freiburg equalised with a header by defender Philipp Lienhart and then took the lead just after the break when Vincenzo Grifo converted a penalty. Gladbach levelled when Alassane Plea hit the top corner of the net with a wonderful curling shot on 50 minutes. The result leaves Freiburg 14th, a point from the bottom three, while Gladbach are seventh and are seven points behind Bayern. Having ended their 18-match winless run by shocking Dortmund 2-1 last weekend, Cologne backed it up with a 2-2 draw at home with Wolfsburg to climb to 15th. Cologne's 18-year-old striker Jan Thielmann opened the scoring, but Maximilian Arnold equalised with a magnificent free-kick. Winger Ondrej Duda restored Cologne's lead when he shot into the corner on 43 minutes, but Wout Weghorst rescued a point away for Wolfsburg just after the break. Cologne are only out of the relegation places on goal difference while Wolfsburg are fifth. Arminia Bielefeld earned their first win since September with a 2-1 victory at Mainz, although both clubs remain in the bottom three. Sixth-placed Union expect to be without in-form striker Max Kruse for the foreseeable future after the 32-year-old injured his hamstring in Friday's 3-1 derby defeat at Hertha Berlin. Kerem Demirbay will miss Bayer Leverkusen's game at bottom side Schalke on Sunday after the midfielder was quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. The rest of the Leverkusen squad have returned negative tests, the club confirmed. "
"MADRID: Spain will be without midfield anchor Sergio Busquets for Tuesday's Nations League decider at home to Germany after he was diagnosed with a sprained knee following Saturday's 1-1 draw away to Switzerland. A medical report sent out by the Spanish soccer federation on Monday said Busquets had sprained his left knee and although the injury was described as ""mild"", he has been advised to miss the game. Barcelona's Busquets, 32, is also a doubt for his side's crucial La Liga match away to Atletico Madrid on Saturday, deepening the Catalans' injury woes after losing forward Ansu Fati for four months to a serious knee injury. Spain must beat Group A4 leaders Germany to progress to the final four of the Nations League. "
"BERLIN: Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer can make history Tuesday by clocking up a record 96th appearance in goal for Germany in a Nations League game against Spain. Neuer equalled Sepp Maier's record of 95 appearances for a Germany goalkeeper, set in 1979, in Saturday's 3-1 win over Ukraine in Leipzig. He can claim the record outright when Germany play Spain on Tuesday to decide their Nations League group. ""It's about time. It's 41 years since I set the record and I congratulate him,"" Maier, 76, told DPA last week. At the age of 34, Neuer has given no hint of retirement. Maier is tipping him to rack up a century of appearances for Germany with seven months to go before their opening match of the postponed Euro championships against world champions France in Munich. Maier asked why Neuer should hang up his gloves: ""There is nothing wrong with him."" The Bayern stopper proved he remains at his best by hoisting the Champions League trophy for the second time last August in Lisbon, having also won the 2013 final in London with the Bavarian giants. Neuer made his international debut in 2009, became Germany's first-choice 'keeper the following year and has kept 41 clean sheets in his 95 appearances. Over the last decade, he has reinterpreted the position like Russia's Lev Yashin did in the 1960s or France's 1998 World Cup winner Fabien Barthez achieved in his era -- Maier is as known for his dominant presence in goal as much as his ability to leave the penalty area and act as an extra defender. Such confidence is backed by a skillset which promoted Pep Guardiola when he was Bayern coach to consider using him as an outfield player. ""I remember when Pep Guardiola seriously considered the idea of putting him in midfield for a match. I could only dissuade Pep with great difficulty,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed in February. In his youth, Neuer once sprinted out of his box to score with a spectacular bicycle kick in a junior match for his then club Schalke. ""As an outfield player, he could easily have played in the third division,"" insists Germany's goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke. ""He anticipates well, his reflexes are remarkable and he has this unbelievably assured aura. ""All together, you can say he has raised the role of goalkeeper to a higher level."" Neuer has lifted every trophy available to him. Since joining Bayern from hometown club Schalke in 2011, Gelsenkirchen-born Neuer has won eight Bundesliga titles. He shut out the normally lethal partnership of Lionel Messi and Gonzalo Higuain as Germany beat Argentina to win the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil. It was a crowning moment for Neuer, who was voted the world's best goalkeeper four straight times between 2013-2016. This year, he was voted Europe's best keeper for the fifth time. He has captained Germany since 2016 and even with Barcelona star Marc-Andre ter Stegen in good form, Neuer has made the national Number One shirt his own. And it was telling that when head coach Joachim Loew decided last year to retire most of his 2014 World Cup-winning veterans, only Toni Kroos and Neuer were retained. "
"THE HAGUE: European Union police agency Europol issued a warning Friday highlighting the risk of organized crime scams linked to Covid-19 vaccines, including the possibility criminals will try to sell dangerous counterfeit vaccines or to hijack shipments of genuine shots. In an âearly warning notification,â Europol said that crime gangs already have reacted to opportunities presented by the coronavirus pandemic. âOnce a legitimate vaccine enters the market, counterfeited versions of the specific vaccine brand are expected to circulate rapidly,â the agency's warning said, citing a phony flu vaccine that the World Health Organization discovered in Mexico in October. âSimilar to the fake influenza vaccine encountered in Mexico, counterfeit Covid-19 vaccines may represent a significant public health threat if they are ineffective at best or toxic at worst, given their production in underground labs without hygiene standards,â Europol said. âFake vaccines may even have a wider-reaching impact if new outbreaks emerge in communities assumed to be vaccinated.â The warning urged heightened vigilance by the EU's 27 member nations and other countries to âthe possible involvement of criminals in the vaccine development and distribution process.â Europol said the âexpected arrival of a genuine Covid-19 vaccine has already inspired criminal activities and will likely be exacerbated once vaccines become available.â The statement came after Britain gave emergency approval Wednesday to a vaccine produced by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany-based BioNTech, making Britain the first Western country to authorize a vaccine against the coronavirus. Europol, which is based in The Hague, said it was aware of criminals placing advertisements on dark web marketplaces âusing the brands of genuine pharmaceutical companies that are already in the final stages of testing.â The police agency said criminal networks also could target the supply chain for genuine vaccines, such as by illegally refilling empty vials if they are not correctly disposed of or hijacking vehicles transporting shots. It urged EU members to share with Europol âany relevant information on criminal activities related to Covid-19 or flu vaccines.â "
"LEIPZIG: Germany have been a work in progress since their disappointing 2018 World Cup first-round exit and they now face their toughest test yet when their full-strength team face Spain in the Nations League on Tuesday. The Germans have never played with the same lineup this year given the COVID-19 interruptions, injuries and a lot of new faces brought in by coach Joachim Loew. The 3-1 victory over Ukraine on Saturday was arguably their most solid performance in months, having drawn four of their previous six matches. Loew, in his 14th year in charge and facing considerable criticism for lacklustre recent performances, looks to have settled on his attack for next year's European Championship. It is difficult to imagine the team without the speed and skills of Serge Gnabry, Timo Werner and Leroy Sane. The latter two scored all three goals against the Ukrainians and the trio have netted 24 times in 23 matches since the 2018 World Cup. Loew also has world-class options in midfield with Leon Goretzka, fresh from a quintuple-winning season at Bayern, oozing power and precision, and Toni Kroos back from suspension. When they take on Spain to decide who will top Group A4 it will be a wobbly defence that faces the toughest test yet. Having led but conceded equalisers in three of their four draws since September, including three goals by Turkey a last-gasp equaliser by Spain in September, Germany's backline is still far from watertight. But Loew is confident the team will come together, with players like left back Philipp Max, who made an impressive debut last week and played against Ukraine, and rising star Robin Koch eager to make the starting lineup. Germany are a point ahead of the Spaniards at the top of the table with the group winners advancing to the next stage of the competition. ""Our demand is to go to Spain and say that we want to win this game and not defend anything,"" Loew said. ""We are not playing against Spain for a point."" "
"LEIPZIG: Timo Werner scored either side of the break to steer Germany from behind to a 3-1 victory over Ukraine in their Nations League match on Saturday to top their group with a game left to play. The Chelsea striker scored twice after Leroy Sane had cancelled out a surprise 12th minute lead by the visitors. The Germans, in the midst of an overhaul following their 2018 World Cup first round exit, are now top of Group A4 on nine points, one ahead of Spain whom they face on Tuesday. The top team qualifies for the final stage of the competition. Ukraine, who had four players, including top striker Andriy Yarmolenko, ruled out after testing positive for COVID-19 on the eve of the game, are third on six points. "
"NEW DELHI: Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Thursday said it stood by its recent findings that 10 of the 13 brands, whose honey it had tested for purity, had failed the adulteration tests carried out in Germany. It added that not only the big brands, but the smaller ones, too, were failing the globally accepted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) test. âWe stand by our findings. Most of these are big brands who have failed the test, but this is not only about them. This is about the consumerâs health. We have shared detailed laboratory results of all the samples on our website,â said CSE, adding that the findings were based on laboratory reports in Germany involving expert interpretation and confirmation of data, a universally accepted practice. âThe Indian lab testing parameters set by FSSAI could not detect this evolved adulteration. The fact that samples deliberately adulterated by us up to 50% of syrups passed all the Indian tests is a robust proof of this. So, any claim of meeting all the Indian standards actually holds limited value,â said CSE director general Sunita Narain. Narain added that NMR was an advanced test to detect adulteration with modified sugar syrups, which was being used in several parts of the world. The Indian government was also mandating it since August 2020 for exports. âIn fact, we have emphasised that NMR should not be made mandatory because it will only help for a limited time. The business of adulteration is so sophisticated that soon there will be syrups that can also bypass this test,â she said. "
"In the quest to develop vaccines against Covid-19, researchers have overcome challenges that typically require years, if not decades, to beat. After the first experimental shots produced positive results in late-stage trials -- a huge feat in itself -- drug companies and health officials faced another set of obstacles as they prepared to inoculate hundreds of millions of people around the world. A number of uncertainties remain, including how long any vaccineâs protection against the coronavirus will last. Answering those questions will help tell us how much longer face masks, social distancing, mass testing and contact tracing will be needed to fight the pandemic. Among the hurdles ahead: Getting the Green LightThe UK on December 2 became the first Western country to authorize a Covid shot, using fast-track options regulators have laid out. Scientists hope it will be the start of a series of vaccines to be authorized, produced and distributed. The UK cleared a vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that was about 95% effective in preliminary analyses of trial results announced in November. In the same month, a second vaccine candidate from Moderna Inc. more or less matched that result, and a third, from AstraZeneca Plc, was 70% effective on average. Months earlier, China and Russia had begun inoculating selected groups, such as medical workers and military personnel, with domestically developed vaccines before they had undergone full testing. Production HurdlesThe more vaccine designs that prove safe and effective, the better, because of the challenges of mass-producing enough shots to meet global demand. Factories were scaling up manufacturing of special glass vials, needles and other necessary equipment in 2020, and even doses of some vaccines that were still being tested. Supplies will be limited at first: Pfizer said it expected to have doses for as many as 25 million people by the end of the year, and for 650 million in 2021. Transport and StorageBy one estimate, airlifting vaccines to protect the worldâs population would require about 8,000 cargo planes. Complicating matters, some of the vaccines must be kept frozen at temperatures as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit). Gavi, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing access to immunization in poorer countries, aimed to have 65,000 vaccine refrigerators in place in developing nations by the end of 2020. Most of the Covid vaccine front-runners, including the first three to demonstrate efficacy, depend on two shots. Johnson & Johnsonâs may work after just one. Vaccine NationalismWho gets the vaccine first will depend largely on deals that governments have made with drug companies. The US, the European Union and the UK placed advance orders for billions of doses of vaccine candidates in 2020, unsure which ones would get the nod. Some countries, notably the U.S., committed significant funds to back research, development and manufacturing, racing to protect their own citizens. Public health specialists warn that so-called vaccine nationalism could prolong the pandemic. The most efficient way to allocate shots would be to vaccinate people at high risk of infection and the most vulnerable, such as health-care workers and the elderly, around the world before moving on to entire populations. Unresolved QuestionsA small number of Covid patients have fallen ill twice, raising concerns about waning immunity for a vaccine. Only some viruses, such as the one that causes measles, provide their victims with something close to lifelong immunity after recovery. As for Covid, early studies showed that levels of virus-fighting antibodies in patients who survived a severe case remained high for several months. However, research has also shown that antibody levels decline over time, especially for mild cases. Other questions include how well different vaccines work in the elderly and other high-risk groups, as well as safety. People who receive a vaccine will need to be monitored for months. The answers will help determine how much longer face masks will be de rigueur. Vaccine HesitancyA vaccine rollout can stop a virus from circulating by contributing to so-called herd immunity. But not everyone will embrace the shots. The persistent myth that childhood vaccines pose significant risks has undercut confidence in immunization in many countries. The fast pace at which Covid shots have been developed and concerns about political interference havenât helped. Polls in the U.S. and Germany in September found only about half of people said they were likely to get a Covid vaccine if it were available. The figure was 68% across seven European countries. Herd immunity comes when enough people in a community have either been infected or vaccinated, and are thus immune. For Covid, the percentage is estimated to range from 55% to 82%. "
"BERLIN: Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany's federal states have agreed to tighten coronavirus restrictions in response to rising infection numbers, according to a draft seen by AFP Thursday. The new regulations, set to be approved later in the day, will apply nationwide and include a minimum fine of 50 euros ($59) for flouting requirements on mask wearing and a limit of 25 people at private parties. Authorities also plan to step up controls to ensure people are adhering to quarantine rules. "
"BERLIN: Germany head coach Joachim Loew has told his stars to knuckle down and take control of their Nations League group, starting against Ukraine on Saturday, after three draws and just one win in their mediocre campaign so far. The three-time European champions host Ukraine in Leipzig on Saturday, then face Spain in Seville on Tuesday. Victories in both of their final two Nations League games would see Germany win the group. ""We must definitely use both games, and our matches in March, to find our game and establish ourselves,"" said Loew, with one eye on next June's Euro 2020 finals. Germany squeezed past a determined Ukraine side with a 2-1 win in Kiev last month. Both Germany and Ukraine are level on six points, one behind group leaders Spain, who face the bottom side Switzerland in Basel on Saturday. Loew is wary of a dogged Ukrainian side coached by former Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko, who has already beaten Spain and Switzerland in the group. ""We will have to overcome a lot of resistance and have extremely good solutions ready if we want to hold our own against Ukraine,"" Loew said on Friday. Germany is unbeaten in their last 11 games, but the statistic masks defensive problems, exposed by last month's 3-3 draws against both Switzerland and in a friendly with Turkey. In their Nations League games so far, Germany surrendered the lead three times to draw with Spain and twice against the Swiss. Bayern Munich wingers Serge Gnarby and Leroy Sane are set to play either side of Chelsea striker Timo Werner. Manuel Neuer captains the side and will equal Sepp Maier's Germany record of 95 appearances for a goalkeeper. With Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos suspended, Leon Goretzka is set to partner Ilkay Gundogan in the defensive midfield. Burly Bayern defender Niklas Suele is also set to play despite training on Tuesday for the first time since testing positive for the coronavirus ten days ago. ""He made a good impression in training and you can assume that he will play,"" Loew added. Despite this season's congested fixture list due to the coronavirus pandemic, Loew says he sees the value of the Nations League and is demanding two final performances. ""The competition has a certain importance and if we beat Ukraine, we would be in a good position"" before the final match against Spain, added Loew. "
"KARLSRUHE/BERLIN: Facebook must comply with an order by Germany's antitrust watchdog to curb data collection from users, a top German court ruled on Tuesday, in a setback for the US social network company that could set a wider precedent.  The Federal Court's stay order, which suspends a decision by a lower court, backs the Federal Cartel Office's view that Facebook abused its market dominance to gather information about users without their consent.  Lead judge Peter Meier-Beck, explaining the decision, said there was no serious doubt that Facebook had a dominant market position in Germany, nor that it had abused terms and conditions banned by the cartel office.  ""Facebook must give users the choice to reveal less about themselves - above all what they reveal outside of Facebook,"" Meier-Beck said.  Welcoming the ruling, cartel office President Andreas Mundt said it showed that ""if data are collected and exploited illegally, it should be possible to take antitrust action to prevent the abuse of market power.""  Facebook said the ruling did not relate directly to appeal proceedings which continue.  ""We will continue to defend our position that there is no antitrust abuse,"" Facebook said. ""There will be no immediate changes for people or businesses who use our products and services in Germany.""  Legal experts said the ruling could have wider ramifications, because Germany is the first country to explore whether data dominance is an antitrust issue.  ""The cartel office is attempting to tame the tech giants and to stop the build-up of economic power through integration of data to 'super profiles',"" said Rupprecht Podszun at the Institute for Competition Law at Heinrich Heine University in Duesseldorf. ""This is something new in terms of antitrust law.""  The cartel office had objected to how Facebook pools data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram - and online tracking of people who do not have accounts via Facebook ""like"" or ""share"" buttons.  In its original order in Feb. 2019, the cartel office said Facebook would only be allowed to assign data from WhatsApp or Instagram to its main Facebook app accounts if users consented voluntarily.  Collecting data from third-party websites and assigning it to Facebook would similarly require consent. Without such consent, Facebook would have to substantially restrict its collection and combining of data.  Facebook appealed against the cartel office's original action, which was suspended by a regional court in Duesseldorf last July. Facebook continues to press its case in Duesseldorf. "
"BERLIN: Germany's foreign minister says the  of Joe Biden as the next US President is an opportunity for a ""new deal"" in trans-Atlantic relations that would revive the close cooperation between America and Europe, but also see Europeans shoulder greater responsibility on the world stage. ""Joe Biden's election victory means one thing in particular: new opportunities for the trans-Atlantic partnership,"" Heiko Maas told The Associated Press in an interview on Tuesday. ""We need a kind of new deal in the trans-Atlantic partnership, the basis of which would consist of responding to international challenges with international solutions and not with a policy of America First or Europe First."" Maas, who has been Germany's top diplomat since 2018, said relations with the United States over the past four years had often been one-sided. ""Decisions were made by the administration or in the White House, and they were then put in front of us and we had to deal with them,"" he said. ""That's not the cooperation we wished for and still wish for."" Maas said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would make the US an ""active player"" on the world stage again and join others in tackling global challenges such as climate change, migration and the coronavirus pandemic. But he acknowledged that this doesn't mean Europeans can relax and let America take charge again. ""We in Europe must get used to taking on more responsibility, at least for our immediate and extended neighborhood,"" Maas said, citing recent efforts to promote security in North Africa and the adjacent Sahel region as examples. ""In my view it won't be the case that the United States will take on the role of global policeman again that we perhaps perceived it to have in the past,"" he said, adding that Berlin is eager to hear what the Biden administration expects of its close allies. "
"BERLIN: Loew admits Germany has ""defensive problems"", but he wants to ""put a sporting exclamation mark at the end of this difficult year"" with three wins. In order to do that, he needs to settle on a defensive formation. The 60-year-old used a three-man defense in the first five games of 2020, when Germany leaked six goals. He switched to a back-four against the Swiss without success, leaving Germany second in their Nations League group, a point behind Spain. According to the 1990 World Cup winner Lothar Matthaeus, Loew needs to stop experimenting and use players who can ""take the game by the scruff of the neck"". Two years on from their disastrous 2018 World Cup campaign, when they failed to qualify from the group stages, Germany has yet to put in a convincing display over 90 minutes this year. So the German public is similarly impatient, eager for evidence the team is developing in the positive way Loew insists it is. As former national captain Bastian Schweinsteiger put it, Germany has conceded ""just too many"" goals. ""That definitely needs work in order to have a chance at the European Championships"" next year, Schweinsteiger said. Loew has come under fire for refusing to recall Jerome Boateng, 32, Mats Hummels, or Thomas Mueller, both 31, who he informed in March 2019 that their German careers are over. Yet the trio is all in impressive form and would provide an experience the current team badly needs. ""We have basically decided not to nominate these players, nothing has changed,"" Loew said recently. Yet Mueller created a record 21 assists in the Bundesliga last season to help Bayern Munich win a domestic and European treble with Boateng as their defensive rock. Likewise, Hummels is also back to his best, marshalling Borussia Dortmund's defense and comfortable launching counter-attacks. Loew said Mario Goetze, who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, could still feature next year. After unhappy spells at Bayern and Dortmund, the 28-year-old, who last played for Germany in 2017, has rediscovered his form in the Dutch league at PSV Eindhoven. ""We're keeping an eye on him, he seems very fresh, very agile,"" Loew said of Goetze, who has scored three goals in his first six Eindhoven games. "
"BERLIN: Germany's disease control reported 2,034 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday, the first time the daily national increase has topped 2,000 since the end of April. The Robert Koch Institute calls the coronavirus outbreaks ""very concerning."" They are reported in various settings, including nursing homes and hospitals, schools, and ""especially among travelers and in the context of religious or family events."" Germany's 16 states are resuming in-class schooling. There are concerns about the risks of virus clusters at schools spreading to families and others. In Berlin, at least 41 schools this week reported students or teachers had become infected. The country was widely applauded for its quick and efficient effort to initially slow the spread of the pandemic, which peaked at more than 6,000 daily cases near the end of March and early April. But the figures have been increasing in recent weeks. Overall, Germany has more than 232,000 confirmed cases and 9,200 deaths. "
"BERLIN: World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who last played for Germany in 2017, has moved back into focus ahead of next year's European Championships with a string of good performances for new club PSV Eindhoven. Germany's national team director Oliver Bierhoff said on Monday he was happy the 28-year-old, who left Borussia Dortmund for the Dutch club this season and has already scored twice in the league and once in Europe, had adapted that quickly. ""I am happy it has worked so well for him that quickly. It is not always easy to move from one country to another but he has high quality,"" he told a virtual news conference in Leipzig ahead of three international matches. Germany play Czech Republic in a friendly on Wednesday before taking on Ukraine on Nov. 14 and Spain on Nov. 17 in the Nations League. ""(Coach) Jogi (Loew) is as you know not a big fan of quickly bringing someone back,"" Bierhoff said. ""But if he (Goetze) continues playing well Mario can always be an issue for the national team."" Goetze scored the extra-time winner in their 2014 World Cup final win over Argentina and won a total of 63 caps. But he struggled in the past seasons to earn a starting spot at Dortmund and had fallen out of favour with coach Lucien Favre. ""We have high quality players up front but we will see how the season progresses,"" Bierhoff said. ""It will be a strange season (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). It would be wise to leave all our options open and see what happens in May before the nomination."" "
"DORTMUND (Germany): RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown. Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added the second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty in an outstanding display by the 32-year-old. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. "
"FRANKFURT: The owner of a Frankfurt restaurant is staging a protest against the coronavirus lockdown in Germany by filling his tables with a hundred stuffed toy pandas, in a play on the word ""pandemic"". German officials are expected on Wednesday to agree to extend until Dec. 20 a ""lockdown light"" they imposed on Nov. 2 that means bars, restaurants and entertainment venues must stay closed, while shops and schools can remain open. ""We wanted to put some life back into our restaurant,"" said Guiseppe Fichera, manager of restaurant Pino. ""They are Panda-Mic pandas.""

The pandas are seated at the restaurant's tables and propped up at the bar, some with bottles of Corona beer. ""It is a silent protest. An offer to our guests,"" Fichera said, adding he would keep the lights on all day and night as long as the lockdown lasts so passersby can enjoy the display.

"BERLIN: Germany coach Joachim Loew picked an expanded 29-man squad Friday for upcoming internationals against the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Spain but is without Niklas Suele, Kai Havertz and Emre Can. The three players were omitted after they recently tested positive for coronavirus, while goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was left out having just returned for Barcelona following injury. Paris Saint-Germain attacking midfielder Julian Draxler also misses out due to injury along with RB Leipzig defender Lukas Klostermann, who underwent knee surgery last month. Despite criticism over Germany's recent performances, Loew again refused to go back on his decision to drop Thomas Mueller, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels. All three have performed well at club level this season but remain in international exile after Loew said the trio were no longer part of his plans in March 2019. PSV Eindhoven left-back Philipp Max and Augsburg centre-back Felix Uduokhai were called up for the first time. Germany host the Czech Republic in a friendly in Leipzig next Wednesday. The 2014 world champions then play Ukraine at the same venue on November 14 in the Nations League before travelling to Spain three days later.

"FRANKFURT am MAIN: Israeli combat pilots and their German counterparts will on Tuesday honour Holocaust victims with a symbolic flyover of Dachau concentration camp, as they carry out their first joint military exercises in Germany. A formation of fighter aircraft, including Israeli Air Force F-16s and Eurofighter jets from the German Luftwaffe, will also overfly the nearby Fuerstenfeldbruck airbase to commemorate the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics that left 11 Israelis dead. The aerial tributes will be the highlight of two weeks of manoeuvres that will see Israeli air forces train on German soil for the first time. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, it is the only training mission the Israeli Air Force (IAF) is conducting abroad this year. Luftwaffe chief Ingo Gerhartz in a statement called the joint exercise ""a sign of our friendship today"". He said it was also a reminder that Germany has an enduring responsibility ""to fight anti-Semitism with the utmost consistency"" because of its Nazi past. The IAF said the mission, which runs until August 28, will give its pilots a chance to practise in unfamiliar surroundings and will include simulated dogfights, air-to-ground battles and missile threats. Israeli pilots will also take part in aerial manoeuvres with Germany and other NATO members during the deployment. Germany and Israel have stepped up their military cooperation in recent years, with the Luftwaffe taking part in joint exercises in the Israeli Negev desert in 2019. But the landmark Israeli visit to Germany is heavy with history. Tuesday's commemorations will start with a joint fly-past over the Fuerstenfeldbruck airbase outside Munich where nine members of the 1972 Israeli Olympic team were killed in a shootout after being taken hostage by Palestinian militants. The gunmen had earlier already shot dead an Israeli coach and athlete at the Olympic Village. They were murdered ""by a common enemy of Israel and Germany: terror"", an Israeli air force officer who asked to be identified only as ""Major T"" told AFP. The German and Israeli jets will then continue on to nearby Dachau where they will fly low over the Nazi death camp that was built in 1933 and served as a model for other concentration camps. More than 40,000 Jews were killed at Dachau during World War II. It will be ""a very moving event for everyone"", said Major T, whose own grandfather was a Holocaust survivor. The flyover will be followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at Dachau to be attended by IAF commander Amikam Norkin and his German counterpart Gerhartz, as well as German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Jeremy Issacharoff. An Israeli officer, the grandson of a Dachau survivor, will give a speech. The homage comes as Germany grapples with an upsurge in anti-Semitic and far-right violence, 75 years after the defeat of the Nazi regime. In the eastern city of Halle last year, a neo-Nazi shot dead two people after trying but failing to storm a synagogue. The attack prompted Chancellor Angela Merkel to say Germany needed ""to do more"" to protect Jewish people. In June, Kramp-Karrenbauer ordered the partial dissolution of Germany's elite KSK commando force after revelations that some of its members harboured neo-Nazi sympathies. "
"BENGALURU: As the sporting world limps back to life, on Friday, India's ace equestrian rider Fouaad Mirza will get the first taste of competition in over three months. The 28-year-old double Asian Games silver medallist will compete at a CCI 3* S competition, which got under way in Oldenburg in the state of Lower Saxony in Germany, on Thursday. Mirza will compete on Friday and Saturday. Speaking to TOI, Mirza said, ""We're all very excited to return to competition. Just the fact that we can start competing again gives our training a bit more direction. We have things to aim for now. I'm looking forward to this weekend."" Although it is a lower-level event, its importance is not lost on Mirza. He has earned a quota place for the Olympics but still has to meet a Minimum Eligibility Requirement (MER) in a CCI 4-star long format. The event was scheduled for July but given the prevailing circumstances, there is no confirmation of the organisers going ahead with it. Mirza, who trains under former world champion Sandra Auffarth, said, ""I didn't increase the intensity of training for this event but picked up pace and started training towards this show in particular. Since it is a relatively lower- level event, we didn't have to change our schedule much. We wanted to use this as a means to get the horses fitter for whatever next during the season."" The Bengaluru talent's schedule hasn't changed much due to the coronavirus pandemic since he is based out of Bergedorf, a village near Ganderkesee in North-West Germany. With the place being relatively secluded, it's been business as usual for the product of the Embassy International Riding School in the city. ""My schedule did not change during the lockdown. Everything has been going on as before. The only difference was, given the uncertainty of the situation, we didn't have any competitions to train for."" Mirza, who chose to stay back in the safer confines of the German hamlet than risk the journey home, is hoping this event will encourage show organisers to return to competition. ""Nobody knows what's in store after this event. Hopefully if everything goes well, it will give confidence to other show organisers and sponsors to come forward to organise more events,"" said Mirza who has four horses - Seigneur Medicott, Fernhill Facetime, Dajara 4, and Touchingwood. While action began with a cross-country race, dressage and show jumping events will be held over the next two days. The event will be held sans spectators with all safety protocols in place. "
"BERLIN: A four-week partial shutdown has started in Germany, with restaurants, bars, theaters, cinemas and other leisure facilities closing down until the end of the month in a drive to flatten a rapid rise in coronavirus infections. The restrictions that took effect on Monday are milder than the ones Germany imposed in the first phase of the pandemic in March and April. This time around, schools, kindergartens, non-essential shops and hairdressers are to remain open. But leading officials decided last week that a ""lockdown light"" was necessary in light of a sharp rise in cases that has prompted many other European countries to impose more or less drastic restrictions. On Saturday, the national disease control center reported the highest number of infections in one day - 19,059 - since the pandemic began. Figures at the beginning of the week tend to be lower, and the center reported 12,097 cases on Monday. But that compared with 8,685 a week earlier, underlining the upward trend. Germany has reported over 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. That is fewer than in many other European countries, but far above the 50 mark that officials set earlier this year as an alarm signal that requires action by local authorities. Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors are to review the situation after two weeks and discuss whether the measures need to be adjusted. ""The aim is to get back under this level of 50 at which health offices are in a position to trace contacts,"" Merkel's chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RBB Inforadio. Merkel said last week that authorities are currently unable to trace the source of three-quarters of infections. The restrictions taking effect on Monday allow groups of at most 10 people, from a maximum two households, in public. Germans have been asked to refrain from making non-essential journeys and hotels are barred from accommodating people on tourist trips. Asked whether the restrictions might last beyond November, Braun replied, ""Our declared aim is that we want to end the measures in this strictness at the end of November."" ""This is also about enabling Christmas business for German companies, and Christmas celebrations with the family for all of us,"" he added. ""I consider that important, the stricter the measures, the quicker they work, so we decided on relatively strict measures."" "
"BERLIN: Germany's official anti-discrimination watchdog says it received significantly more complaints about racism in 2019 than the year before. The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency said Tuesday that it received 1,176 complaints about racism last year, an increase of 10% compared to 2018. This represented about a third of all 3,580 complaints received by the agency. Others concerned discrimination based on gender, disability, age, religion, sexual identity and world view. The number of complaints about racism has more than doubled since 2015. Bernhard Franke, the head of the agency, called for changes in the law to improve the legal standing of those affected by discrimination, saying that âGermany needs to do more in the fight against racist discrimination.â He noted that the coronavirus pandemic has further exacerbated some forms of discrimination, with his office receiving numerous reports of racist abuse suffered by people of Asian background in recent months. "
"BERLIN: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 14,177 to 532,930, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 29 to 10,481, the tally showed. "
"LUDHIANA: Riding on a strong global demand wave for bicycles, e-bikes and automotive components, leading bicycle and component manufacturer Hero Motors Company (HMC) group is set to cross Rs 1,000 crore in international revenue by financial year (FY) 22. The group has set a target for further trebling this figure by FY-24, banking on high growth in the European and American markets. Pankaj M Munjal, chairman and MD of HMC said âOur vertical integration strategy has created international outposts for sales, marketing and R&D over the past few years through strategic acquisitions such as Insync Bikes in the UK and HNF GmbH in Germany, which is now bearing fruits. Simultaneously, we have built up additional capacities and capabilities to manufacture global quality bicycles and e-bikes in India. The international back-end is now being integrated with Indian factories to shift this manufacturing to India, which was traditionally outsourced to China, Taiwan, Cambodia, Eastern Europe, etc. Banking on this futuristic strategy and a global surge in demand, we are expected to cross Rs 1,000 crore in international revenue by FY 2022,â Munjal added âHaving gained a strong international footprint and having integrated it with our manufacturing units in India, we have now set sights on a 3-year roadmap of trebling our international revenue by FY24. We are highly positive about the next round of high growth that is expected from the European, British and American markets. Our groupâs Indian manufacturing capacity is set to receive a major boost with the opening of the new international cycle valley plant in Punjab. Our company is set to add a capacity of 4 million units per annum to the current 6 million units through the cycle valley project. The additional capacity will further help us fulfil the growing global demand for bicycles, e-bikes and automotive components.â Meanwhile Hero also is doing good in the automotive components sector as well, according to a spokesperson of the company , âOn the automotive front as well, the company has witnessed steady growth, with its components manufacturing also contributing significantly to its international business. The groupâs gears, transmission and bike drive train business has steadily built itself by adding key automotive OEMs as its customers. The Group has a robust projects RFQ pipeline of over USD 1 billion spread over the next 8 years. Going forward, the HMC Group is looking at further augmenting its R&D and Business Development activities in European Union in addition to its existing Joint Venture with Hewland Engineering, which is a transmission and hybrid drives supplier to formula racing and high-end carsâ "
"FRANKFURT: BMW on Wednesday said it will retool its German factories to build electric cars and components and shift manufacturing of combustion engines to plants in Austria and England as part of a broader shift toward low-emission cars. Factories across the globe are clamouring for investment into next-generation cars as electric vehicles gain traction with consumers and as governments hasten the demise of the combustion engine. Germany on Wednesday unveiled a 3 billion euro ($3.56 billion) scheme to promote low-emission cars and Britain said it will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030. ""By the end of 2022 all our German factories will make at least one fully electric car,"" Milan Nedeljkovic, BMW's board member responsible for production said in a statement on Wednesday. BMW's Munich plant, which currently makes four, six, eight and twelve cylinder combustion engines, will be retooled with a 400 million euro investment until 2026, to make next-generation electric vehicles, the carmaker said. BMW said production of eight and twelve cylinder engines will move from Munich to Hams Hall in England, and other engines will be made in Steyr, in Austria. Bavaria, where BMW is based, will receive the lion's share of the investments, the carmaker said. The BMW i4 electric car will be built in Munich, a fully electric version of the 5-series and 7-series will be made in Dingolfing and an electric X1 will be made in Regensburg. BMW's said the number of staff at its Dingolfing factory making electric car powertrains, will double, to 2,000 workers. BMW's plant in Leipzig, Germany, will start manufacturing the Mini Countryman and the Regensburg and Leipzig plants are being prepared to make battery modules, the company said. BMW will improve its cost structure by 500 million euros by the end of the year, the company also said. "
"MUMBAI: Flexible air ticket cancellation policies and payment terms that help passengers avoid losing money in case of a trip cancellation, limiting the number of passengers on a plane and providing travellers the option to physically distance themselves throughout the journey, emerged as the top three ways to build traveller confidence during the pandemic, according to a survey conducted by a travel technology company. The predominant concern for Indian travellers was the increased risk of catching or transmitting the virus. ""Indian respondents also cited the safety and cleanliness of public transport (37%) and government-imposed quarantine at either end of the journey (35%) as one of their biggest concerns about traveling in light of Covid-19,"" said the study. However, respondents who traveled only for business in the past 18 months were less concerned about the increased risk of catching and transmitting the virus (26%) compared to those who have traveled just for leisure in the past 18 months (43%). Concerns over losing money due to trip cancellations ranked similarly between the two groups-16% and 17% respectively. ""Mobile applications that provide on-trip notifications and alerts emerged as the most appealing technology to increase confidence for Indian travelers (56%). This was followed by the need for contactless payments (54%) and the ability to have airline boarding passes on their phones (51%),"" said the global travel survey, conducted by travel technology company, Amadeus. The study covered over 6,000 travelers who had travelled abroad in the past 18 months, and these included participants from India (1,000 respondents), Singapore, France, Germany, UK and US. About 85% of the respondents said that technology that helps reduce human contact, queues and physical touchpoint would increase the confidence to travel in the next 12 months. Other points cited to increase traveller confidence were effective test, track and trace programmes to contain infections, assurance of sanitization, hygiene and safety measures in hotels and accommodations and limiting the number of passengers on flights.

"Pfizer Inc will seek emergency US approval for its Covid-19 vaccine within days after final trial results showed its shot had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmaker said on Wednesday. The efficacy of the vaccine, which could start being distributed in December, was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately affected the elderly and certain groups including Black people. The success rate of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech is the highest of any candidate in late-stage clinical trials so far, and experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic. Pfizer said 170 volunteers in its trial involving over 43,000 people contracted Covid-19 but 162 of them had only been given a placebo, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe Covid-19, one had received the vaccine. ""A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,"" said Enrico Bucci, biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""Today is a special day."" American drugmaker Pfizer said it would apply for the emergency authorization ""within days"" and expected the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory committee to discuss the data in a public meeting, likely to be held in December. The FDA committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could still change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. The final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing 94.5% effectiveness. The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life. The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over 65 years, which experts said was crucial. ""This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,"" said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool's department of pharmacology. Global shares rose on Wednesday as the trial results countered concerns around the stubbornly high global infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.2% while BioNTech jumped 4.7% in the United States. By contrast, Moderna dropped 4.1%. Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future. Fatigue and headachesWhile some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations this year, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country. Pfizer also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year. Distribution of a shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in a normal fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box. Moderna's vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36Â°-46Â°F). Pfizer said its two-dose vaccine, called BNT162b2, was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. It said the only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue and headaches. Out of 8,000 participants, 2% had headaches after the second dose while 3.8% experienced fatigue. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events. ""These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,"" said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge. ""It would be interesting to see what adverse reactions were reported by the group getting the placebo, since that gives an idea of how much of the adverse effects are due to the vaccination process, and how much is due to the vaccine itself."" For its trial, Moderna named five severe side effects experienced by at least 2% of those who received its shot: fatigue at 9.7%, muscle pain at 8.9%, joint pain at 5.2%, headache at 4.5%, pain at 4.1% and redness around the injection site at 2%. Millions of dosesAuthorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under the age of 18 in trials, giving shots to children as young as 12. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger patients soon. Pfizer's final results come as the virus is running rampant around the world, placing an enormous strain on healthcare systems with record numbers of new cases and hospitalizations. The approach of winter in the northern hemisphere in tandem with the holiday season is expected to worsen case numbers as people spend more time indoors and have family gatherings. Pfizer and BioNTech also said they plan to submit the data to other regulatory agencies around the world and submit data from the study to a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Pfizer reiterated that it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop vaccines against Covid-19, the next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson says it is on track to deliver data this year. "
"GENEVA: Europe made up almost half of the world's 4 million new coronavirus cases last week but recorded a nearly 10 per cent fall in infections compared to the week before, thanks in part to strict government lockdown measures that have fanned some discontent, the World Health Organization reported Wednesday. In the German capital of Berlin, violent clashes between those protesting coronavirus restrictions and police erupted Wednesday near the center of the city after protesters disregarded police advice to wear masks and social distance. The latest weekly tally from the UN health agency comes found that its 54-nation European region continued to report most new cases worldwide â 46 per cent â but the decline in cases followed âthe strengthening of public health and social measuresâ in the region. But as new cases fell, though, the tally of deaths rose âsubstantiallyâ in Europe over the last week to more than 29,000 reported virus deaths. WHO said. WHO's Americas region saw a 41% increase in new cases, suggesting that a higher weekly death toll could soon follow there. Southeast Asia was the only region that saw a drop in cases and deaths. In Europe, WHO said the sharpest rise in coronavirus cases was in Austria, which saw a 30 per cent increase in new cases compared to the previous week. WHO also noted the UK was the first country in the region to record more than 50,000 deaths. Pockets of Western Europe have shown signs of turning a corner, particularly in the lowlands near the English Channel. Belgium said Wednesday it had taken a major step in containing the resurgence of the coronavirus, reporting a drop in the daily death count for the first time since the latest Covid-19 wave hit the continent this autumn. Virologist Steven Van Gucht, from the government's Sciensano health group, said the daily average of deaths in the country now stood at 185 people, a 5 per cent decrease compared to the average a week ago. Over the last week, the daily average of hospital admissions dropped 24 per cent and new infections fell 39 per cent. Officials in the Netherlands, to the north, were easing coronavirus restrictions amid falling infection rates, and were poised to reopen public venues like cinemas, museums, libraries, zoos and swimming pools â still with limitations on how many people can visit â after a two-week closure. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte hailed a âpositiveâ downward trend but said cases counts were still too high. He warned the country to remain on a partial lockdown. In mid-October, Dutch rates of infections were among the worst in Europe. Meanwhile, some people in Germany were growing increasingly restive about increasing lockdown measures. In Berlin, police fired water cannons Wednesday at demonstrators and carried away some who were protesting coronavirus restrictions near the famed Brandenburg Gate and the seat of the federal government. The melee erupted after crowds ignored calls to wear masks and keep their distance from one another in line with pandemic rules. It came as German lawmakers were debating a bill that could provide the legal groundwork for the government to issue social distancing rules, require masks in public and close stores and other venues to slow the spread of the virus. Most people in Germany support such rules, but a vocal minority has staged regular rallies arguing that the restrictions violate the constitution. âWe want our lives back,â read one sign carried by protesters in Berlin. Germany was praised for its handling of the first wave of the virus, but like many parts of Europe has seen a sharp uptick in new infections in recent weeks. Overall the country has seen 833,000 coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 virus-confirmed deaths, a death toll one-fourth that of Britain's. "
"PARIS: Ferran Torres grabbed a hat-trick as Spain condemned Germany to their worst defeat in 89 years on Tuesday, winning 6-0 in Seville to qualify for the UEFA Nations League finals and join France, who came from behind to beat Sweden 4-2. Manchester City forward Torres was the star for Spain, who were as brilliant as Germany were bad. The result raises further questions about Germany coach Joachim Loew, who was already under pressure coming into this game. ""This has been a black day for us,"" admitted Loew after Germany's heaviest defeat since losing 6-0 to Austria in 1931. â° RESULTS â°ð¤ Who impressed you?#NationsLeague— UEFA Nations League (@EURO2020) 1605649397000They came into their final game in League A, Group 4 on top, a point clear of Spain, and so only needed a draw at an empty La Cartuja to qualify for the finals in October next year. But Alvaro Morata headed Spain in front in the 17th minute before Torres crashed in the second on 33 minutes after Dani Olmo's header hit the bar. His City team-mate Rodri headed in another to make it 3-0 for Spain before the end of a first half in which they lost Sergio Canales and skipper Sergio Ramos to injury, with the latter coming off feeling his hamstring. Germany's defence was posted missing as Jose Gaya burst through and squared for Torres to get the fourth on 55 minutes, and Fabian Ruiz teed up the 20-year-old Torres to complete his hat-trick. Serge Gnabry hit the bar for Germany before substitute Mikel Oyarzabal completed the rout. ""It was one of the best and most complete matches of the Spanish national team,"" said Spain coach Luis Enrique. Germany now have several months to reflect on this loss before the start of 2022 World Cup qualifying in March and then the delayed Euro 2020 in June and July. â½ï¸â½ï¸ They scored two each. Who did it best?ð«ð· Olivier Giroudð­ð· Mateo KovaÄiÄðµð¹ RÃºben Dias#NationsLeague https://t.co/X2nt59tK7E— UEFA Nations League (@EURO2020) 1605659518000Spain, meanwhile, become the second side to qualify for the Nations League finals after France clinched their place by beating Portugal at the weekend. The World Cup holders finished off their League A, Group 3 campaign by beating Sweden behind closed doors at the Stade de France as Olivier Giroud continued his remarkable scoring record for Les Bleus with a brace. Viktor Claesson's deflected early strike gave Sweden the lead, but Giroud soon equalised and Benjamin Pavard put France ahead before half-time. Giroud then headed in Kylian Mbappe's cross to make it 3-1 before the hour mark, and Kingsley Coman scored France's final goal at the death after Robin Quaison had netted Sweden's second. Having recently overtaken Michel Platini's tally of 41 goals for Les Bleus, Giroud is now on 44 and is closing in on Thierry Henry's overall record mark of 51. The 34-year-old remains a key player for France despite being on the periphery with his club Chelsea, for whom he has started just once this season, in the League Cup. Sweden finish bottom of the group behind Croatia and are relegated to the second-tier League B for the next edition of the competition. That is despite 10-man Croatia losing 3-2 at home to Portugal in Split, with Manchester City defender Ruben Dias getting a 90th-minute winner for the 2019 Nations League champions. Chelsea's Mateo Kovacic had scored twice for Croatia, either side of Dias's first of the night and a Joao Felix effort for Portugal, who featured Cristiano Ronaldo wearing the captain's armband. Marko Rog was sent off for Croatia. The remaining two spots in the Nations League semi-finals will be decided on Wednesday, with Italy and Belgium currently in pole position. Tuesday's other scheduled Group 4 game between Switzerland and Ukraine in Lucerne was postponed after six Covid-19 cases in the Ukrainian squad led to their entire delegation being ordered into quarantine by Swiss health authorities. Elsewhere, Montenegro's 4-0 victory over Cyprus saw them top League C, Group 1 and win promotion to League B. Gibraltar and the Faroe Islands won promotion to League C. "
"BERLIN/PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel ordered their countries back into lockdown on Wednesday, as a massive second wave of coronavirus infections threatened to overwhelm Europe before the winter. World stock markets went into a dive in response to the news that Europe's biggest economies were imposing nationwide restrictions almost as severe as the ones that drove the global economy this year into its deepest recession in generations. ""The virus is circulating at a speed that not even the most pessimistic forecasts had anticipated,"" Macron said in a televised address. ""Like all our neighbours, we are submerged by the sudden acceleration of the virus."" ""We are all in the same position: overrun by a second wave which we know will be harder, more deadly than the first,"" he said. ""I have decided that we need to return to the lockdown which stopped the virus."" Under the new French measures which come into force on Friday, people will be required to stay in their homes except to buy essential goods, seek medical attention, or exercise for up to one hour a day. They will be permitted to go to work if their employer deems it impossible for them to do the job from home. Schools will stay open. As in the darkest days of spring, anyone leaving their home in France will now have to carry a document justifying being outside, which can be checked by police. Germany will shut bars, restaurants and theatres from Nov. 2-30 under measures agreed between Merkel and heads of regional governments. Schools will stay open, and shops will be allowed to operate with strict limits on access. ""We need to take action now,"" Merkel said. ""Our health system can still cope with this challenge today, but at this speed of infections it will reach the limits of its capacity within weeks."" Her finance minister, Olaf Scholz, posted on Twitter: ""November will be a month of truth. The increasing numbers of infections are forcing us to take tough countermeasures in order to break the second wave."" France has surged above 36,000 new cases a day. Germany, which was less hard-hit than its European neighbours early this year, has seen an exponential rise in cases. In the United States, a new wave of infections has been setting records with six days to go until Election Day. President Donald Trump has played down the virus and shows no sign of cancelling public rallies where his supporters often refuse to wear masks or keep a safe distance. European stock markets closed at their lowest levels since late May on Wednesday. In the United States, the S&P 500 was down 3%. In an effort to blunt the economic impact, Germany will set aside up to 10 billion euros ($12 billion) to partly reimburse companies for lost sales. Italy has set aside more than 5 billion euros. IF WE WAIT IT WILL BE TOO LATEWhile leaders have been desperate to avoid the crippling cost of lockdowns, the new restrictions reflect alarm at the galloping pace of the pandemic from Spain, France and Germany to Russia, Poland and Bulgaria. ""If we wait until the intensive care units are full, it will be too late,"" said German Health Minister Jens Spahn, whose country already has taken in patients from its neighbour the Netherlands, where hospitals have reached their limits. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said on Wednesday that hospital beds were at 90% of capacity in 16 regions of the country, while officials have warned that even well-equipped health systems like those in France and Switzerland could reach breaking point within days. Hopes that new treatments might curb the spread were dented when the head of Britain's vaccine procurement task force said that a fully effective vaccine may never be developed and that early versions were likely to be imperfect. The latest figures from the World Health Organization on Tuesday showed Europe reported 1.3 million new cases in the past seven days, nearly half the 2.9 million reported worldwide, with over 11,700 deaths, a 37% jump over the previous week. So far, more than 42 million cases and more than 1.1 million deaths have been recorded worldwide from the virus, which was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year. Governments across Europe have been under fire for a lack of coordination and for failing to use a lull in cases over the summer to bolster defences, leaving hospitals unprepared. Since the weekend, police and protesters have clashed repeatedly in Italian cities from Naples to Turin. Restaurant owners and business groups have been critical. ""At 6 p.m. public transport is often crowded. You take the risk because you have to get to work. You wear a mask, you take hand gel with you,"" Elio Venafro said after getting off a bus in central Rome on Wednesday. ""It's the new normal."" Read this story in Bengali"
"BERLIN: Bundesliga side Union Berlin pulled off a transfer coup on Friday by recruiting former Germany striker Max Kruse, an accomplished poker player and singer, on a free transfer. Having quit Turkish side Fenerbahce in June, Kruse, who has scored 74 goals in 250 Bundesliga appearances, has returned to Germany, where he had spells at Werder Bremen, Freiburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Wolfsburg and St Pauli. The 32-year-old is a colourful character off the pitch having finished third in the 2014 World Series of Poker and appeared on the Turkish version of talent show ""The Voice"" last December singing a cover of the Dean Martin hit ""Sway"". Kruse made the last of his 14 appearances for Germany in late 2015 when he scored in a Euro 2016 qualifier victory against Georgia. He was dropped by Germany in March 2016 after an argument with a journalist at a Berlin nightclub while celebrating his 28th birthday, days after making headlines for leaving 75,000 euros ($88,000) in cash in a taxi. ""I'm not here for the nightlife in Berlin or anything. I'm here to play football,"" Kruse insisted Friday. Having turned down a return to Werder Bremen, Kruse said he was looking to joining Union who have already signed goalkeeper Andreas Luthe from Augsburg and defender Robin Knoche from Wolfsburg. ""I'm happy to be playing in the Bundesliga again and to get to know a cool new club like Union, who have developed really well in recent years,"" he said after Union finished their first Bundesliga season 11th in 2019/20. ""It was important for me to switch to a club that completely convinces and challenges me. ""During the conversations with those responsible, I felt immediately comfortable, that's why I decided to join Union."" He will compete with Nigeria international Anthony Ujah and Sweden's Sebastian Andersson for the forwards positions. "
"KYIV: Ukraine's national soccer team are waiting for the decision of Switzerland's authorities if their Nations League match will be allowed tomorrow as three of their players tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday. ""The tests of three players - Eduard Sobol, Yevhen Makarenko and Dmytro Riznyk - had the so-called conditionally negative status yesterday. After additional research, doctors found that these samples contain COVID-19,"" the team said in a statement. It added that the three players were isolating in their hotel rooms. Ukraine travelled to Switzerland after being defeated by Germany last Saturday. "
"BERLIN : Germany will require people arriving from countries considered high-risk to take coronavirus tests starting this weekend, the health minister said Thursday, as the country recorded its highest daily tally of new infections in three months. German officials have voiced alarm over a steady upward creep in the number of new infections over recent weeks. The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said 1,045 cases were recorded on Wednesday - the first time since May 7 that it has counted more than 1,000 cases in a day. Daily figures can be volatile or distorted by delays in reporting, and the number is still far short of the peak of more than 6,000 reached in early April. ""What we are seeing is a lot of small outbreaks,'' Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters. ""People are getting infected at family parties, at their place of work or at community facilities."" On top of that, school holidays - the dates of which are staggered across Germany's 16 states -are ending in some regions, increasing concerns that vacationers could bring home the virus. Last Saturday, the government started offering free tests for people returning to the country. People entering from countries deemed high-risk - currently most of the world outside Europe, as well as Luxembourg and parts of northern Spain - are required to quarantine for 14 days unless they can present a negative test result no more than two days old. Spahn said that, starting Saturday, people arriving from those countries will be required to take a test unless they bring a new test result with them. ``I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,`` Spahn said. The minister dismissed arguments by some politicians that people who can afford a vacation should also have to pay for their tests. He said many returnees from high-risk and other countries ``have saved hard for this vacation, put a lot of money aside, don't have a lot in reserve and nevertheless, I want to make it possible for them to get tested.'' Germany's COVID-19 response has been widely regarded as relatively successful. The Robert Koch Institute has recorded 9,175 deaths from over 213,000 confirmed cases -- a lower death rate than in many comparable countries. "
"MELBOURNE: Australia head coach Justin Langer says his pacers have improved in the last two years since the Test series defeat to India and he can't wait to see them have a go at Virat Kohli and his men in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India had stunned Australia 2-1 to win their maiden Test series Down Under in 2018-19. The two teams are set to lock horns again on Australian soil in a four-Test series with the opening Day-Night game in Adelaide starting December 17. ""If I go back to that time (2018-19), we lost a toss at the MCG after winning the Perth Test match - lost the toss on possibly the flattest wicket I've seen in Test cricket ... and they (India) bowled for nearly two days,"" Langer was quoted as saying by 'Sydney Morning Herald'. ""And then we had to back it up and play at the SCG the next Test match on a pretty flat wicket as well. Not making excuses, but it was tough going back then. ""India were on top of their game, they deserved to beat us for the first time in their history. But our guys are two years better and a lot of the Indians are the same, more experienced. I can't wait to see them go. Can't wait."" India had won the first and third Test at Adelaide and Melbourne respectively, while Australia claimed a victory in the second game at Perth with the final match ending in a draw. The trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins is likely to be the first choice in the pace department this time too but the selectors also have a lot of options such as James Pattinson, Queenslander Michael Neser and Sean Abott to choose in the 17-member squad. Pattinson, who had replaced an injured Hazlewood in the Melbourne and Sydney Tests against New Zealand last summer, is however short of red-ball form as he was busy in the recently-concluded IPL in UAE. Neser is yet to make his Test debut despite being with the Test squad for more than a year, while NSW's Abbott has emerged as a potential Test all-rounder in last two years, displaying good form in the Marsh Sheffield Shield season. ""James Pattinson who has come back from that back injury, we saw how powerful that was during the last Ashes in England. Michael Neser keeps playing well over and over again,"" Langer said. ""And Sean Abbott, every Shield player I'm talking to, batsmen, they're all saying Sean Abbott is bowling fast and his lines and lengths are incredible. ""(We have) got great depth and I can't wait to see them get going against India this summer."" "
"BERLIN: Germany lifted its travel warning for several coastal regions of Turkey on Tuesday, ceding partially to weeks of campaigning by Ankara, whose tourism industry relies heavily on German visitors. The warning will be lifted with immediate effect for the four coastal provinces of Antalya, Izmir, Aydin and Mugla, government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said in Berlin. ""Turkey has developed a special tourism and hygiene concept for these four regions in order to realise safe tourism under the conditions of the pandemic,"" Demmer said. Turkey will require anyone travelling back to Germany to present a negative coronavirus test within 48 hours before departure. Turkey had been one of 160 countries outside the European Union and the Schengen area for which a travel warning was in place until August 31. In July, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had demanded a review of the travel warning while visiting his German counterpart Heiko Maas in Berlin. Anyone currently arriving in Germany from areas considered to be at high risk must produce a negative coronavirus test or go into quarantine for 14 days. Germany, which is home to a large Turkish community, makes up the biggest group of tourists by nationality in Turkey. In a blow to tourism in Spain, Germany last week added three northern Spanish regions to its list of high-risk destinations. "
"BERLIN: Germany expects to pay out 22 billion euros ($26 billion) in Covid-19 relief aid from January through June 2021 to companies and self-employed people, people close to the matter said, as the impact of the pandemic extends into next year. Separately, Germany's November coronavirus aid package to compensate firms affected by lockdown measures will this month amount to 14 billion euros, they said. Initially, the government had expected to pay out 10 billion euros. The German government's council of economic advisers expects the economy to shrink less than initially feared this year thanks to a strong summer, but a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is clouding the growth outlook for 2021. As part of the new round Covid-19 relief measure, companies can get up to 200,000 euros a month to cover fixed costs such as rent, while solo entrepreneurs can get up to 5,000 euros. Germany has enough fiscal firepower to unleash more rescue and stimulus measures if needed to counter the impact of the pandemic on Europe's largest economy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz had said on Thursday. Germany plans to borrow more than 300 billion euros in total this year and next, but it needs to consider carefully which relief measures make sense, Scholz said. Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel puts the total amount of outright, non-repayable support Germany has been able to offer companies and citizens at 8.3% of its economic output - not far short of the 9.1% figure in the United States.

"Covid-19 vaccine results from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE fueled optimism that the world will soon have a potential way out of the pandemic, yet experts cautioned that the shot still has many hurdles to clear. Questions about production, distribution and, most importantly, the performance and capability of the shot itself still need to be answered, even if the numbers look highly promising, according to vaccine specialists. Deep-freeze hurdle makes Pfizerâs vaccine one for the richThe Pfizer trial started less than four months ago, and how long the vaccine will confer protection and how many will benefit are almost complete unknowns for now. Complete coverage: Coronavirus pandemicâThe key question still centers upon time,â said Michael Kinch, a drug development expert and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis. âWill time tell us that the protection remains useful for the larger population?â Trust in vaccines vital to halting pandemic: WHOIn a remarkable scientific feat - achieved without funding from the US vaccine accelerator known as Operation Warp Speed -- Pfizer and BioNTech produced positive results just over 11 months after the emergence of Covid-19 in China. An early analysis of data from the trial of more than 40,000 volunteers suggested the vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing the illness, the partners said Monday, the same day the US surpassed 10 million total cases. Live updates: Coronavirus pandemicThe results were published in a press release, not a peer-reviewed journal study. Nonetheless, they electrified investors, as stocks surged and bonds tumbled around the world. The S&P closed at a two-month high, while travel and entertainment stocks rebounded after months of pandemic damage. How long before you can get a Covid-19 vaccine?The likely success of the first vaccine in a large, late-stage trial raised hopes that others, like those developed by Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford, will also work. Yet infectious disease researchers cautioned against getting too excited over the limited data that Pfizer has revealed. Too EarlyThe companiesâ statement âdoes not at all tell us about just what theyâve actually accomplished,â said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, during a radio interview Monday. âItâs really too early to put any definition to what this new vaccine research shows us.â The headline number of 90% reduction in symptomatic cases says little about what kind of cases are being prevented. Detail on how well the vaccine works in the elderly and other vulnerable groups who most need protection is yet to come. About half the trial participants are elderly, and itâs possible to project from the current results that the efficacy among older people should be above 80%, BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said. More analysis is needed to be sure, he said. A shot that prevents serious disease would be important for relieving pressure on overloaded hospitals and emergency rooms. The current data analysis doesnât include any severe cases, but theyâre expected to occur as the study continues, Pfizer Senior Vice President William Gruber said. It still may be difficult to accrue the five severe cases that the US Food and Drug Administration has said it wants to see in vaccine trials, because the rate of serious infections has gone down as the pandemic progressed and treatment has improved, he said. Pfizer expects to have accumulated two months of safety data for people in the trial by next week. If there are no unforeseen problems, the company could apply for an emergency use authorization in the US soon after that, potentially this month. At that point, FDAâs internal reviewers will first pore over the safety, efficacy and manufacturing data. The agency also has promised a review by outside experts to increase public confidence in any vaccine authorized. A date for that hearing hasnât been set yet. If an emergency authorization is granted, a second committee of outside experts convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will quickly weigh in to decide who should get the vaccine first. Only then will distribution begin. All this means that even if Pfizerâs data hold up, it may be late December or even early January before a vaccine becomes available. At that point there might be around 50 million doses worldwide, enough for 25 million people. In an interview late last month, Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said that if a vaccine crosses the line, there could be uncertainties about the durability of protection and how often people may need booster shots. The number of doses available would also probably be unclear. Global vaccine supplies might begin to catch up with demand at some point in 2022, he said. âEven if we got a positive readout and a pretty benign safety signal and an emergency use authorization is extended -- if thatâs what ends up happening in the US -- the quantity of the vaccine that will become available will still be limited,â he said. The Warp Speed effort to develop and buy vaccines would have to achieve complete success -- with six of six successful -- for the US to reach herd immunity by June, according to Airfinity Ltd., a London-based research firm. Failures and delays could stretch out the timeline for slowing the virusâs spread to 2023 or beyond. Vaccines like Pfizerâs must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, a challenge that will need to be overcome if the vaccine is to be made broadly available, according to experts. Masks, Social DistancingRollout of any shots will take time, so masks, distancing and testing and contact tracing will still be vital, said Ohid Yaqub, a senior lecturer at the University of Sussexâs Science Policy Research Unit. President-elect Joe Biden also emphasized the need to continue such measures. Itâs also important to continue watching those who received the vaccine for years. The messenger RNA technology used in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has never been deployed in humans before. âIt will be crucial to track the safety and efficacy over the coming weeks and months,â said Kinch, the Washington University expert. âIf nothing else, we have learned that we need to look to the long term.â âA positive signal would be exciting,â Hatchett said, âbut it certainly wouldnât mean that the pandemic is about to be over.â "
"LONDON: The England women's soccer team have called off Tuesday's friendly against Germany in Wiesbaden after a member of their backroom team tested positive for COVID-19. ""While we all wanted to play Tuesday's game, this was absolutely the right course of action. I thank Germany's staff for their understanding and our FA colleagues for their support,"" England coach Phil Neville said in a statement. The England side have not played a game since losing 1-0 to Spain at the SheBelieves Cup in March. "
"MELBOURNE: Italy sealed a place in the semi-finals of the ATP Cup by winning both singles matches against France on Wednesday, while Germany did their chances of progressing no harm by taking an unassailable 2-0 lead over Canada at the Rod Laver Arena. With the second edition of the national team competition truncated because of Australian Open coronavirus quarantine, victory for Fabio Fognini and Matteo Berrettini in the singles combined with Tuesday's 2-1 win over Austria ensured Italy would top Group C. Fognini downed Benoit Paire 6-1 7-6(2) in the opening match of the day on John Cain Arena before Matteo Berrettini outwitted Gael Monfils 6-4 6-2 to make France's doubles win academic. ""We are playing good, we've got great energy, we are really happy to be in the semi-finals,"" Berrettini said. ""Last year, I didn't play and unfortunately the guys couldn't make it, so we're really pumped."" If that clash was one-sided, the Germany-Canada Group A tie was anything but with four of the five sets in the two singles matches decided by tiebreakers. Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff dominated the first two and finished off Milos Raonic with a thumping ace for a 7-6(4) 7-6(2) victory that gave Germany a 1-0 lead in their opening tie. After losing 2-1 to Novak Djokovic's Serbia on Tuesday, Canada needed to win the tie to stay alive in the competition and Denis Shapovalov made a positive start by taking the first set against Alexander Zverev. Shapovalov, backing up after a loss to Djokovic, needed treatment on his shoulder as world number seven Zverev levelled up the contest in the second set, however. Zverev, in his first match of the year, warmed to his task in a tight deciding set but was unable to convert seven break points as Shapovalov dug deep. Shapovalov had his chances in the decisive tiebreak but an unforced error and a double fault at crucial moments opened the door for Zverev and the German stormed through it with his 14th and 15th aces for a 6-7(5) 6-3 7-6(4) victory. Russia could join Italy in the semi-finals if they can beat Japan in their Group D clash on later on Wednesday, while Greece play their first Group B tie against an Australia team facing an early exit after Tuesday's 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Spain.

"MUMBAI: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has agreed to take over some assets as well as employees of US-based Prudential Financialâs technology services unit for a nominal sum. Under the deal, a majority of the employees (over 1,500) of the unit, Ireland-based Pramerica Systems, will move to TCSâs payrolls besides movable (servers, laptops, etc) and immovable properties (offices). As part of the transaction Prudential, which is not affiliated to Prudential of the UK, has also awarded a five-year, $300-million IT contract to TCS, Indiaâs second-most valued company after Reliance Industries. The New Jersey-based life insurer has been a customer of TCS and the deal adds to the Indian companyâs talent and intellectual capital in Ireland. Present in Ireland since 2001, TCS has over 200 people servicing 30 clients â local as well as global. The Prudential deal comes three days after TCS agreed to buy Deutsche Bankâs technology services unit in Germany for one euro. Prudential has retained Pramerica Systemsâs legal entity that will continue to operate from Ireland and will focus on providing regional services. "
"PANAJI: From football to Formula 1, Red Bull own several sports teams across the world. It is in football, though, that the energy drink manufacturers have grabbed the most attention. RB Leipzig qualified for the UEFA Champions League just 10 years after they were founded and even made it to the semifinals last season. Other teams in Austria, New York and Brazil are climbing up the charts. But despite the success rate, there wonât be another addition soon. âThere are clubs in Brazil, US etc, and from the Red Bull point of view, they have a great portfolio already. They actually do not plan to get another club into their portfolio,â RB Leipzig CEO Oliver Mintzlaff told journalists on Thursday. RB Leipzig have entered into a three-year strategic partnership with FC Goa, who have made it to the playoffs of the Indian Super League (ISL) for a record five times in six seasons. FC Goa also became the first Indian club to qualify for the AFC Champions League group stage. Both clubs confirmed that the partnership has no financial implication. While the initial agreement is for three years, Mintzlaff said the club was already looking ahead. âWe consider ourselves as a club that has footsteps that actually go beyond Germany. This leads to the fact that we want to become more attractive to global partnerships. âI would not exclude the idea of making a trip to India with the first team. When this will happen and what extent this will be, itâs too early to say. There have been certain ideas about that. Ask me in a yearâs time and I can tell you more,â said Mintzlaff. "
"BERLIN: China has condemned Germany's decision to suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong, accusing Berlin of a ""serious breach of international law."" Germany's foreign minister announced the suspension on Friday following the disqualification of 12 pro-democracy candidates from legislative elections and a subsequent decision to postpone the elections. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam cited a worsening coronavirus outbreak in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory in postponing the vote. The Chinese Embassy in Berlin expressed ""strong indignation and firm opposition to the wrong remarks of German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas"" in a statement posted on its website and dated Friday. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States also have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong last month after the central government in Beijing imposed a new national security law on the city. The move raised fears that Hong Kong's freedoms and local autonomy are being taken away. Germany's Maas described the election decisions as ""a further infringement of the rights of Hong Kong's citizens."" The Chinese Embassy said the actions were justified and consistent with the ""one country, two systems"" framework under which Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Chinese control in 1997. ""The German side's erroneous remarks on Hong Kong and the suspension of the extradition treaty with Hong Kong are a serious breach of international law and basic norms governing international relations and gross violation of China's internal affairs,"" the embassy statement said. ""We firmly oppose them and reserve the right to react further."" Germany currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency. "
"MADRID: Real Madrid and Germany player Toni Kroos has taken a swipe at FIFA and UEFA, claiming the world and European organising bodies are treating players like ""puppets"" by expanding tournaments and creating new competitions. Kroos criticised the creation of the UEFA Nations League in 2018, which he competes in with Germany, as well as FIFA's expanded Club World Cup, which was set to take place in 2021 before being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""With the invention of all these new things we seem to be just the puppets of FIFA and UEFA,"" Kroos said on the Einfach mal Luppen podcast the player presents with brother and fellow professional Felix. ""These competitions are created to suck everything out of every single player physically and to suck out as much money as possible."" The midfielder also lambasted the concept of a European Super League, after Barcelona's outgoing president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed last month he has agreed to sign the Catalans up to a future league involving the continent's top teams. Kroos believes domestic competitions and the Champions League are ""top products"" that should not be meddled with. ""When certain things work well it is a good idea to leave them that way,"" he added. "
"BERLIN: Thomas Mueller can further fuel appeals for him to be recalled by Germany when Bayern Munich launch their Champions League defence at home to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday behind closed doors. Having managed a record 21 assists in the Bundesliga last season, Mueller has continued his sparkling form by scoring five goals and creating four more so far in 2020/21. The 31-year-old netted twice in a 4-1 win at Arminia Bielefeld last Saturday when Robert Lewandowski also grabbed two goals for Bayern. His latest eye-catching club performance has prompted fresh hopes of a Germany recall for Mueller, who was dropped by Joachim Loew from the national set-up in 2019 alongside Jerome Boateng and Mats Hummels. Now Bastian Schweinsteiger has joined fellow former Bayern and Germany players Didi Hamann and Lothar Matthaeus in calling for Mueller to be reinstated. ""If I was national coach, Mueller as well as Boateng would be in the national side,"" Schweinsteiger, 36, told Monday's edition of German magazine Kicker. Schweinsteiger helped win the 2014 World Cup in Brazil alongside Mueller, who knows he still has plenty to offer Germany after 100 internationals and 38 goals for 'die Mannschaft'. ""Everyone can see that I am in good form. Let's just see what happens,"" Mueller told broadcaster ZDF on Saturday, yet Loew has so far showed no signs of reversing his decision. Last month, Mueller became the most successful German footballer of all time -- surpassing Schweinsteiger's record of 26 titles -- when Bayern won the German Super Cup as he lifted a trophy for the 27th time in his career. After an early season plagued by tired legs and defensive wobbles, Bayern will need Mueller's creativity against an Atletico side who have conceded just one goal in four games so far this season. Bayern, who won their first ever European Cup against Atletico back in 1974, will begin their Champions League defence behind closed doors. The Bavarians have a perfect record at home against Diego Simeone's side, having twice beaten them in Munich in 2016. Yet Atletico knocked Bayern out of the semi-finals in 2015/16 and the German side remain wary of their Spanish opponents. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer warned that Atletico are a ""strong team"" who were ""uncomfortable"" to play against. ""The good thing is that the game is on Wednesday, so we have an extra day to prepare,"" said the Bayern captain. After having less than a month between last season's Champions League final and the first Bundesliga weekend, Bayern's relentless schedule has continued apace. Wednesday's game will be their third in six days, while further Champions League fixtures against Salzburg and Lokomotiv Moscow mean Bayern have midweek and weekend games in each of the next three weeks. The physical strain and the need to rotate has led to a few early-season hiccups. Bayern suffered a shock 4-1 defeat to Hoffenheim last month, and needed a late Robert Lewandowski penalty to seak a 4-3 win over Hertha Berlin before the international break. On Saturday, Flick criticised his team for a poor second half performance, after individual errors led to a goal for Bielefeld and a red card for Bayern's Corentin Tolisso. They can ill-afford a repeat against Atletico. Others have also noted Bayern's lapses in concentration at the back, which has seen Neuer let in five goals in four league games so far. Matthaeus has accused the champions of being ""passive"" and ""vulnerable"" at the back this season. Joshua Kimmich should bring more stability to Bayern's midfield, with the Germany midfielder expected to return after he missed last weekend's game to be with his wife, who is expecting the couple's second child. ""Joshua is very important for us against Atletico. I hope he can play,"" Flick told Sky. "
"BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel is defending her country's coronavirus restrictions and calling on her compatriots to keep respecting social distancing rules. Germany started loosening its lockdown restrictions on April 20 and since then has at least partly reopened many sectors. At the same time, the country has seen frequent protests against lockdown measures. Merkel said in her weekly video message on Saturday that the measures were necessary, and that officials must continue to justify why some restrictions can't be lifted while ensuring that they are proportionate. Merkel said that Germany has ""succeeded so far in achieving the aim of preventing our health system being overwhelmed."" "
"BERLIN: Negligence is behind Germany's steady rise in new coronavirus infections, the head of a state-funded research body said on Tuesday, adding it was unclear if a second wave was underway. ""The new developments in Germany make me very worried,"" Lothar Wieler, of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, said during his first news conference in weeks. ""The rise has to do with the fact that we have become negligent,"" he added, urging people not to flout social distancing rules. The number of daily new cases almost doubled on Tuesday to 633, and the RKI, which is Germany's most closely followed compiler of COVID-19 data, linked that to increased contact at parties and the workplace. With 206,000 confirmed cases and just over 9,000 deaths, Germany wants to avoid a second wave, which would bring back lockdowns after economically crippling restrictions that closed many businesses for six weeks in March and April. Europe's biggest economy withstood the pandemic with far fewer deaths than some large neighbours like France and Italy, owing to widespread testing, a well-equipped healthcare system and good adherence to social distancing. The summer holiday season has prompted fears that tourists returning from destinations experiencing a surge in new cases like Spain could sow the seeds of a second wave. But Wieler downplayed that. ""It is irrelevant if you are on holiday or at home,"" he said. ""The holiday is as much a part of the precautions against the spread of COVID-19 as your work and home life. The setting is irrelevant."" Germany on Tuesday advised holidaymakers not to travel to several Spanish regions including Catalonia, home to Barcelona. The port city of Hamburg is weighing a ban on selling alcohol in its red light district after revellers ignored social distancing rules at the weekend. "
"BERLIN: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 745 to 176,752, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The reported death toll rose by 57 to 8,147, the tally showed. "
"BERLIN: German prosecutors said Monday a German woman who allegedly joined the Islamic State group in Syria was arrested upon her return to the country. She is accused of membership in a foreign terrorist group, war crimes against property and other crimes. Federal prosecutors said in a written statement that the woman, identified only as Nurten J. in line with local privacy laws, was arrested Friday at Frankfurt Airport. Prosecutors allege she traveled with her then 4-year-old daughter to Syria in 2015 to join IS. There, she married a man who had also come from Germany and they started a family. The woman allegedly raised her children according to IS ideology and in return she received a monthly payment from the extremist group and lived successively in five different apartments whose former tenants were either killed or evicted. In 2016 and 2017, she often had a friend visit her home who brought along an enslaved Yazidi woman who then allegedly had to clean J.'s home. After IS lost its territories in Syria, J. and her family were captured by Kurds and were eventually taken into deportation custody in Turkey. It was not clear if she was returned to Germany in custody and and the fate of her children was not known. The federal prosecutor's office could not immediately be reached for further details. "
"MUMBAI: In a boost to Metro 4 (Wadala to Kasarvadavli) and 4A (Kasarvadavli to Gaimukh), a German ministry has extended credit of Rs 4,800 crore for both projects. Copies of the loan agreement, the ""highest disbursal for a project in India, at the lowest rate of interest offered by any financial institution"", were exchanged between MMRDA commissioner R A Rajeev and the consul-general of Germany at a event here, attended virtually by urban development minister Eknath Shinde and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. An MMRDA spokesperson said, ""The German federal ministry for economic cooperation and development (BMZ)-KfW approved two loans for euros 545 million to the Indian ministry of finance to fund Metro 4 and 4A, which will ease the distress of millions of commuters each day and help provide a cleaner, less congested city."" The combined cost of these two lines is Rs 15,000 crore. Line 4 is 32km and Line 4A 2km, and around 20% work has been completed on the route. Thackeray said, ""Though it is good to take decisions to start mega transportation projects, which are very much required in Mumbai, it is more important to do financial closures and provide all support like making available the required land. I hope Lines 4 and 4A will be completed on time."" He said the loan from Kfw had eliminated skepticism that was raised regarding lack of funds to carry out Metro projects initiated and planned in the Mumbai metropolitan region. MMRDA said the funds will cover system components for Lines 4 and 4A, footpaths and cycle routes surrounding stations to improve integration within the transport system. The 34km Metro line will link Mumbai to Thane. (With PTI inputs)"
"BERLIN: A German official says authorities have now linked more than 2,000 coronavirus infections to an outbreak at a slaughterhouse last month that led to a partial lockdown in two western counties. Regional authorities restored some coronavirus restrictions in the Guetersloh and Warendorf areas in late June after more than 1,400 people at the Toennies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck tested positive for the virus. North Rhine-Westphalia state's health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann, told Thursday's edition of the daily Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung that authorities now link 2,119 cases to the Toennies outbreak. He said a link is possible in another 67 cases.  The partial lockdown has since been lifted and the slaughterhouse reopened, with improved hygiene precautions. "
"BERLIN: Jerome Boateng said on Tuesday that the Bayern Munich players are behind David Alaba amid the Austrian defender's contract extension stalemate with the European champions. Alaba could leave Bayern at the end of the season after the latest round of extension talks between the club and the player's agent broke down. On Monday, the 28-year-old said he was ""hurt and disappointed"" to learn through the press that Bayern had withdrawn their latest offer to extend his deal, which expires next June, after protracted wranglings. ""Of course it's an issue, but he is focused on the essentials,"" Boateng, who partnered Alaba at centre-back in Tuesday's 6-2 win at Salzburg, told Sky. ""It is clear that it's not easy, but he put in another great game today and we're behind him."" Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic admitted before the match it looked increasingly likely that the Austrian would exit the club next year. Alaba has repeatedly been linked to Premier League giants Manchester United and Manchester City. ""We submitted an improved offer to him, for which we set a deadline of last weekend,"" said Salihamidzic. ""Before that, we informed him that we would withdraw the offer if the deadline expired. That's what happened. ""In football you should never say never, but I don't know how we could come together (to an agreement) now. ""We have to deal with the fact that David will leave us."" Thomas Mueller also said Alaba would let his football do the talking, after Bayern's 14th straight Champions League victory. ""The good thing about David is that he backs himself regardless of these discussions,"" he said. ""But it's nice when there is something up at FC Bayern -- we also want things to crackle a bit."" ""I used to enjoy reading about 'FC Hollywood',"" Mueller joked, referring to the German media's former nickname for Bayern, who used to have a reputation for off-field drama. However, Bayern head coach Hansi Flick was clearly unimpressed ahead of Saturday's top-of-the-table Bundesliga clash at Borussia Dortmund. ""It is important to me that we have calm in the team before the game against Dortmund -- everything else is not an issue for me,"" Flick flatly told Sky when asked about Alaba. "
"NEW DELHI: Forced to pull out of the SaarLorLux Open in Germany and stay in quarantine there because of Covid-19 fears, an Indian badminton contingent, including defending champion Lakshya Sen, on Tuesday returned to the country after testing negative for the virus. Lakshya's dreams of defending the title had come crashing down when he had to withdraw from the tournament after his father-cum-coach, DK Sen, tested positive for coronavirus. He, however, had no symptoms. Two other Indian shuttlers -- former world No. 13 Ajay Jayaram and 2018 winner Subhankar Dey, who had arranged funds to participate in the German tourney after the Denmark Open, also had to withdraw owing to contact with DK Sen. Lakshya, Jayaram, Dey and physio Abhishek Wagh had tested negative ahead of the tournament. The Indian contingent, however, had to spend five days in quarantine before fresh test results found them to be negative, clearing their return to the country following the ordeal. ""We reached Bangalore at home this morning around 5 a.m. We all are fine and healthy,"" a relieved DK Sen told PTI. ""We were in quarantine since my first Test came positive. The German officials did the second Covid Test for all five of us on November 1 and thankfully the reports came negative, so we immediately returned home."" While Lakshya, his father and physio reached Bengaluru, Dey and Jayaram took a flight from Frankfurt to Delhi. Lakshya, who claimed five titles in the senior circuit last year, including two BWF World Tour Super 100 top honours at the SaarLorLux Open and Dutch Open, had received a bye in the opening round of the event along with Dey. Jayaram, on the other hand, had won his opening-round clash but the Covid concerns brought an unfortunate end to India's campaign at the tournament. ""...This situation prevented the players from competing in the event and local authorities put them in isolation,"" the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA), where Lakshya is a regular, said in a statement. ""The timely intervention of Badminton Association of India (BAI), German Badminton Association and Badminton World Federation (BWF) ensured that after five days of isolation, all of them were again put through a Covid test on Sunday which turned out negative. ""This helped the players, coach and physio to return back to India. Earlier, the local authorities in Saarbrucken insisted on all the players and support staff to remain in isolation till the 10th of November 2020."" BAI also thanked the various authorities for extending their support to the Indian contingent and informed that ""the Indian shuttlers and support staff will be in a seven-day home quarantine now."" With no events lined up till January, Lakshya will now return to Almora for a few days. Earlier, Jayaram had asked for help from sports minister Kiren Rijiju, the national badminton federation and BWF, saying that the organisers had not given them any information or assistance apart from asking them to isolate. Dey too had demanded compensation for the ordeal in his social media post. The Sports Authority of India (SAI) was quick to assure that it will pay for the expenses to be incurred by the two players ""for the length of their quarantine in Germany from October 30 to November 10 on humanitarian grounds.""

"Right back Lucy Bronze returned to the England squad after missing last month's training camp due to an injury as coach Phil Neville named a 28-player squad on Tuesday ahead of the friendly against Germany later this month. Bronze, who signed for Women's Super League side Manchester City this season, withdrew from September's training camp after she picked up a knock in the goalless draw against Brighton & Hove Albion. The 28-year-old will be joined by Olympique Lyonnais forward Nikita Parris, who also returns to the national squad after missing the previous camp due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. England will be back in action for the first time in more than seven months when they face Germany on Oct. 27 at the Brita-Arena in Wiesbaden behind closed doors. The Lionesses last played in the SheBelieves Cup in March, where defeats by hosts United States and Spain condemned them to a third-place finish in the four-team tournament. ""It's exciting to be facing top-class opposition again after such a long lay-off,"" Neville said in a statement. ""Germany are currently ranked second in the world so there's no doubt it will be a tough test for us. ""It will give us a clear idea of where we're at in terms of our squad depth and development as we prepare for the home UEFA Euro in 2022."" The Lionesses, ranked sixth in the world, will wrap up the year with a match against Norway on Dec. 1 at Bramall Lane. "
"HAMBURG: Ten more cases of African swine fever have been confirmed in wild boars in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, Germanyâs agriculture ministry said on Monday. The new discoveries bring the total number of confirmed cases to 65 since the first one on Sept. 10. All were in wild animals with no farm pigs affected, it said. Germany's Friedrich-Loeffler scientific institute had confirmed the latest animals had African swine fever, the ministry said. All were found in the area around the first discoveries. China and a number of other pork buyers banned imports of German pork in September after the first case was confirmed, causing Chinese pork prices to surge. The disease is not dangerous to humans but it is fatal to pigs and a massive outbreak in China, the world's biggest pork producer, and elsewhere in Asia led to massive changes in global pork trade flows. "
"BERLIN: Germany host Switzerland on Tuesday amid sharp criticsm of the national team's head coach Joachim Loew, who is still struggling to shake off the aftermath of their 2018 World Cup debacle. By their own high standards, Germany have made a low-key start in the Nations League with two draws, against Spain and Switzerland, and a narrow win over Ukraine before facing the Swiss in Cologne. A full-strength side scrapped a 2-1 win against Ukraine in Kiev on Saturday following three straight draws when the Germans leaked second-half goals on all three occasions. On Tuesday, Toni Kroos is set to make his 100th appearance for Germany, but Julian Draxler, Marcel Halstenberg and Lukas Klostermann are all carrying knocks and are doubtful starters. Injuries aside, Loew feels little need to ""change much"" in the starting line-up despite worrying signs in Kiev. Only a fortunate Leon Goretzka header -- after a rare mistake by Ukraine goalkeeper Heorhiy Bushchan -- made the difference as the Germans often gave possession away cheaply. ""I see the big picture on the way to the European Championships,"" Loew insisted with the Euro 2020 finals eight months away. ""We have a clear plan. We know what we are doing."" Loew has a contract until 2022, but his popularity -- which peaked when Germany won the 2014 World Cup -- crashed after the 2018 finals in Russia, where the Germans failed to get out of their group. Despite Loew's promises to rebuild the side, Germany are still susceptible to lapses of concentration, as proven when they conceded three equalisers against Turkey. German fans seem to agree with Loew's critics amid disappointing recent television viewer figures for international matches in football-mad Germany. Around 7.5 million tuned in to watch the win over Ukraine. It was a slight improvement on the 6.77 million who saw last Wednesday's 3-3 friendly draw against Turkey - 21.5 percent of the market, the lowest viewing figure in the 14 years since Loew took charge. TV pundit Bastian Schweinsteiger, a key part of Loew's 2014 World Cup team, told broadcaster ARD he feels ""the public can no longer identify 100 per cent"" with the national team. ""It's a pity. I hope things can be turned around soon,"" he said. After the draw with Turkey, Lothar Matthaeus, who captained West Germany to their 1990 World Cup win, slammed Loew for fielding players like Nico Schulz, who struggles to get a game for Dortmund. ""That is precisely why nobody turns on the television to watch Germany any more,"" Matthaeus wrote in a column for German daily Bild. Loew brushed off such criticsm. ""I have been experiencing different opinions for 16 years,"" he said having first joined Germany's coaching team back in 2004. ""You have to see where we have come from. After the World Cup in 2018, we were at the very bottom."" But his critics can argue that there is little sign of development in the two years since. "
"KIEV: Germany picked up a first win in their Nations League group on Saturday with a workmanlike 2-1 away victory against Ukraine to break their run of three straight draws, but head coach Joachim Loew admitted they should have won by more. Defender Matthias Ginter gave Germany a first-half lead in Kiev, then Leon Goretzka capitalised on a horrible mistake by the Ukraine goalkeeper before Ruslan Malinovskyi converted a late penalty for the hosts. Loew was ""satisfied"" with the away win, but admitted ""we should have been three or four goals ahead before they scored"". He rued Malinovskyi's penalty, given away cheaply by Niklas Suele, which was ""unnecessary. We hardly gave the Ukrainians a chance to score"". ""In some phases we gave the ball away too easily,"" added Loew. After drawing their opening Nations League games against Spain and Switzerland, then being held 3-3 by Turkey in a friendly on Wednesday, the win lifted Germany to second in the group behind Spain. However, Germany can expect a tougher task against Switzerland in Cologne on Tuesday and should have scored more having enjoyed around 75% possession against a weakened Ukraine side. ""It was important to get the win, but we didn't take our chances to make it 3-0. It wasn't the best game from us,"" admitted goal-scorer Ginter. Loew named a full-strength side with Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Julian Draxler and Chelsea defender Antonio Ruediger the only two survivors of the side which drew against Turkey. They took the lead on 20 minutes when Ruediger put in a good run in the area and squared the ball where Ginter was waiting at the far post. The Germans kept Ukraine goalkeeper Heorhiy Bushchan busy all evening. With half an hour played, the Dynamo Kiev shot stopper tipped a long-range strike from Joshua Kimmich over the bar, then palmed a Serge Gnabry header around the post four minutes later. However, in the match build-up Germany head coach Joachim Loew had made a point of wanting less possession given away, but on far too many occasions his side was guilty of surrendering the ball with sloppy passes. One particular poor pass to no one by Gnabry was snapped up by the Ukraine attack. The chance came to nothing, but a better team would have punished the Germans' first-half sloppiness. Germany tightened their passing and doubled their lead four minutes after the break when Bushchan - for once - failed to hold a cross and Goretzka headed the stray ball into the net. Bushchan quickly regained his composure to deny Draxler's shot at point-blank range when he got down to make a great parry moments later. Another great save just before the hour mark saw a volley by wing back Luke Klostermann pushed the ball over the crossbar. Ukraine pulled a goal back 14 minutes from time when Suele mistimed his tackle in the area and brought down Ukraine forward Roman Yaremchuk, Malinovskyi converting the consolation penalty. "
"BERLIN: Nine years late and far above its original budget, Berlin's new airport is finally opening Saturday with little ceremony and, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, few passengers. Construction of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport Willy Brandt, named after the former West German chancellor though better known as BER, started in 2006 and it was initially slated to open in October 2011. But a string of technical and planning problems forced officials to abandon six opening dates, most embarrassingly, in 2012, just four weeks before flights were supposed to start. That propelled the project to the status of a national joke as airport managers struggled to get a grip on various problems, including a complex fire safety system that long caused headaches. The airport has cost some 6 billion euros (USD 7 billion), about three times what was originally planned. It is finally opening at a time when air traffic has been hobbled by the pandemic. The opening of the new airport's Terminal 2 has been delayed until early next year because it isn't currently needed. BER's opening spells the end of West Berlin's Cold War-era Tegel airport, the busier of the two aging and increasingly cramped airports that so far served the reunited German capital. Saturday's first landings at the new airport will kick off a week-long transition, with the last flight from Tegel due to depart on Nov. 8. The former East Berlin's Schoenefeld airport, which is located across the runways from BER, is being incorporated into the new airport as its ""Terminal 5"". Tegel and Schoenefeld handled a total 35.6 million passengers last year, putting Berlin in third place in Germany behind the Frankfurt and Munich hubs. "
"BERLIN : An emergency field hospital for Covid-19 patients has officially opened in the German capital, but so far there are no patients. The clinic opened Monday on the site of Berlin's convention center has a capacity of 500 beds that can be doubled if required. But since Germany has managed to sharply lower the rate of infection since building began four weeks ago, the capital's 50 hospitals have proved more than sufficient for treating all coronavirus patients. Berlin's top health official, Dilek Kalayci, said the clinic would serve as a ``reserve hospital,'' noting that the experience of Spain, Italy and New York had shown even well-equipped medical systems could become overloaded in a pandemic. "
"NEW DELHI: India has started creating âair bubblesâ with some countries to ensure eligible people can continue to travel direct to and from there on airlines of both sides, till resumption of regular schedule flights in a post-pandemic world. The first special arrangements or bubbles have been established with US, France and Germany. TOI had reported about impending travel pacts with these three countries on July 9. Talks with UK are at an advanced stage for the same and âsimilar arrangements are in place with UAE till July 26, 2020,â the aviation ministry said. It clarified on Friday that this agreement with UAE is till July 26 and not August 26, 2020, as the ministry spokesman had stated a day earlier. Separately, Air India has decided to lower fares of its Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights to the west. Travel under the interim arrangement of air bubbles will be regulated depending on entry requirement of each country, including India, and not everyone like a tourist can fly till specifically allowed. Aviation minister H S Puri said there is demand from many countries to have travel bubbles with India. âUnited is operating 18 flights between India and US from July 17 to 31, a Delhi-Newark daily and Delhi-San Francisco thrice weekly. Air France will operate 28 flights to Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru from July 18 to August 1. Lufthansa will also be operating flights,â said Puri. Flights of these airlines coming to India during the pandemic will no longer be required to come as ferry (meaning no passengers on board, only cargo) and be able to fly in some foreigners like diplomats and OCI card holders apart from Indians stranded abroad in accordance with government regulations.

The competition will further bring down fares,â minister Puri said. He recently asked UK to have its airlines operate flights to India under the proposed bubble. As of now, AI operates VBM flights between India and UK. To be sure, these are interim arrangements being worked out with countries that have high demand for travel to and from India and with airlines of both sides willing to operate on them and will will be continuously reviewed. Air India chairman Rajiv Bansal said the average one-way VBM economy fare on US/Canada flights used to be about Rs 1 lakh. âWe reduced that by 25% to Rs 75,000. We will bring the fares further down. Similarly fares for VBM flights on Europe and UK routes will also drop,â Bansal said. The move for air bubbles comes as some countries started objecting to AI VBM repatriation flights carrying passengers both in and out of India. They sought reciprocal rights for their airlines. The US had warned each VBM flight there would require clearance from July 22 unless that happened. France had stopped allowing people to fly to Paris on VBM flights. Germany was getting increasingly restive on the issue. Asked if the air bubble with US will remove this threat, Puri said: âI am confident all issues will be resolved. United currently flies into India with only cargo on its flights (while taking passengers on flights to US). We are working that they are able to bring some passengers on flights to India as per Indian travel rules during the pandemic.â Some states in India require a list of passengers coming on international flights 24 hours in advance. Complying with this requirement, say foreign airline officials, under their data protection laws. India acknowledged this issue. âOur airlines are complying with all requirements and foreign airlines will also need to do the same. They are facing certain issues with this but the rules of the home and health ministry for travellers have to be followed by all,â Puri said. Resumption of regular schedule international flights can be considered once domestic air travel reaches 50-55% mark. âMany international travellers to and from metros like Delhi and Mumbai need connecting domestic flights. Domestic travel is steadily rising but we are still at 30% mark. There are restrictions in many places like Mumbai that has capped number of daily domestic flights. Once we reach the 50% domestic capacity mark, then resumption of schedule international will be considered,â Puri said. "
"BERLIN: Germany are set to field a full-strength team as they hunt a Nations League win in Kiev against a Ukraine squad which has lost 14 players either injured or suffering from the coronavirus. The Ukrainian FA (UAF) said Thursday that Shakhtar Donetsk pair Mykola Matvienko and Brazilian-born Junior Moraes will not face Germany after becoming the latest to test positive for Covid-19. That comes after six Ukrainian players missed the 7-1 thrashing by France in Paris on Wednesday after contracting the virus. ""Thus, the number of players who due to injury or the coronavirus were unable to partially or fully participate... is 14,"" said the UAF on their website. As cover, Ukraine coach Andriy Shevchenko has called up Donetsk trio Viktor Kovalenko, Romero Marlos and Valeriy Bondar to face the Germans at Kiev's Olympic Stadium (1845 GMT). Germany have drawn their last three internationals after conceding late equalisers and will include a host of stars to get back to winning ways. ""It will give us more experience. We will benefit from this,"" said Germany head coach Joachim Loew on arrival in Kiev. Germany captain Manuel Neuer will be between the posts, Real Madrid's Toni Kroos is back in midfield after a leg injury while Chelsea striker Timo Werner will be up front. Germany are under pressure to get a first win in a Nations League group also containing Spain and Switzerland. An inexperienced Germany side surrendered the lead three times in Wednesday's 3-3 friendly draw against Turkey and Loew has demanded his side finish their chances and control the game in Kiev. After drawing 1-1 in their first two group games against Spain and Switzerland, Germany badly need a win in Kiev before hosting the Swiss in Cologne on Tuesday. Up to 21,000 fans - 30 percent of the stadium capacity - will be allowed into the stadium in Kiev according to UEFA regulations The Germans plan to spend barely 36 hours in Kiev and are under strict instructions to observe the hygiene protocol with face masks compulsory in the team hotel. ""We will be moving around within a bubble and strictly adhering to the regulations,"" Loew added. "
"Car buyers in Europe can now get their hands on a brand-new electric vehicle for less than the typical cost of a mobile-phone contract. Thanks to newly generous subsidies, some are even free. Shoppers have swarmed virtual showrooms in Germany and France - the regionâs two largest passenger-car markets - after their national governments boosted electric-vehicle incentives to stimulate demand. Their purchase subsidies are now among the most favorable in the world, according to BloombergNEF. The state support is allowing Autohaus Koenig, a dealership chain with more than 50 locations across Germany, to advertise a lease for the battery-powered Renault Zoe that is entirely covered by subsidies. In the 20 days since it put the offer online, roughly 3,000 people have inquired and about 300 have signed contracts. âIf we had more sales staff, we would have sold even more,â said Wolfgang Huber, head of electric-car sales for the dealer in Berlin, who published a Facebook post asking customers to be patient. âWe did expect an increase in sales with the subsidies, but this run really struck us.â Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron have sought to soften the coronavirus pandemicâs blow to the badly hit car sector. Sales in Europe have recovered more slowly in Europe than in China or North America, pressuring policy makers to support major sources of employment and economic activity. In France, sales of Renaultâs Zoe model are on track to double this year even as demand for gasoline vehicles has cratered. And in the Netherlands, where the city of Amsterdam is banning non-electric cars from 2030, a 10 million-euro ($11.4 million) fund to support EV purchases was used up in just eight days this month. âThere are a lot of attractive offers right now because of higher subsidies, and thatâs boosting demand,â said Aleksandra OâDonovan, an analyst with BloombergNEF. âThe EU is pushing toward decarbonizing transport, and the coronavirus crisis has allowed them to accelerate that.â Germanyâs subsidies of as much as 9,000 euros per electric vehicle have boosted sales for Carfellows, a German auto-trading website, about tenfold. âThis is a golden moment for us,â said Rainer Westdoerp, a spokesman for the Berlin-based startup, which on Wednesday will start offering leases of Daimler AGâs battery-powered Smart EQ for 9.90 euros a month. Carfellows took down a similar offer for the Smart model in June after about 1,000 customers reached out within three days and the automaker couldnât supply cars fast enough, Westdoerp said. While the best deals -- including Carfellowsâs Smart offering -- are usually for buyers of company cars because of perks including tax and risk rebates, private drivers in Germany can still lease an electric car from the site for as little as 39 euros a month. In France, where the government raised subsidies to 7,000 euros per car this year, customers can lease the Zoe from 79 euros a month. Buyers will have to read the fine print, as some offers come with additional one-time fees or down payments. And not everyone in Europe is spending more to speed up EV adoption, with the U.K. and Belgium recently cutting aid. China had planned to end its subsidies this year but extended them to 2022 in response to the pandemic. But in general, the picture looks attractive for European buyers as the continent is home to eight of the nine countries with the largest national purchasing-subsidies, according to BNEF. Governments will have to weigh carefully when to let those subsidies run out to avoid sales falling off a cliff. But there will come a time when that wonât be a concern anymore, OâDonovan said. âThe decreasing price of batteries suggests that EVs should be cheaper to buy than gasoline cars from the mid-2020s,â she said. âOnce that happens, the market will accelerate even without subsidies.â "
"BERLIN: Germany coach Joachim Loew on Thursday cut five players from his squad to face Ukraine and Switzerland in the Nations League as he banks on the experience of returning Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig players. Germany squandered the lead three times to settle for a 3-3 draw against Turkey on Wednesday, playing with a makeshift team as many players were rested. It was the third game in a row that the Germans gave up a lead and ended up drawing. It was also the lowest in terms of TV audience figures in Loew's 14 years in charge. Benjamin Henrichs, Nico Schulz, Niklas Stark, Nadiem Amiri and Mahmoud Dahoud, who all played against the Turks, were dropped ahead of Saturday's game in Ukraine and the home match against the Swiss three days later. Loew will have Bayern's Joshua Kimmich, Serge Gnabry, Niklas Suele, Leon Goretzka and keeper Manuel Neuer back in his 23-man squad after they were rested along with Leipzig's Marcel Halstenberg and Lukas Klostermann. Striker Timo Werner, who has recovered from an illness, will also return as will Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos. ""It will be very important to win the coming matches,"" Loew said. ""There we will obviously have a completely different team on the pitch (than against Turkey). Everyone is fired up and highly motivated to win."" "
"PARIS: France's 7-1 thrashing of Ukraine was the pick of the European football friendlies on Wednesday as Spain clung on for a draw in Lisbon and Turkey saved pride with a late goal against Germany in Cologne. At the Stade de France it was teenager Eduardo Camavinga and veteran Olivier Giroud inflicting much of the damage for Didier Deschamps' world champions on Covid-19 hit Ukraine. The 17-year-old Camavinga put himself on the map becoming the youngest man to score for France in over a century with an audacious overhead flick for the ninth minute opener. Deschamps made Giroud captain for his 100th appearance and in return the Chelsea forward scored a first-half brace that left him on 42 international goals, just nine short of Thiery Henry on 51. ""Well that's two more in the bag and it was already quite a significant haul wasn't it,"" said Deschamps, who has persisted with Giroud over the years when France seemed to be coming down with top strikers. ""I'll just carry on and see how far it goes,"" said Giroud, 34. PSG's Kylian Mbappe, Bayern Munich's Corentin Tolisso and Barcelona striker Antoine Griezmann were also on the mark with fine strikes. Ukraine's team had been so ravaged by injury and the coronavirus they included a 45-year-old coach as second 'keeper for the night. European champions in 2016 Portugal return to the Stade de France in the Nations League on Sunday and used a friendly with their Iberian rivals Spain to warm up. Cristiano Ronaldo and Renato Sanchez both struck the woodwork for Portugal, who then should have won it in injury-time only for Joao Felix to miskick at the back post. Spain were the better team early on at the Jose Alvalade stadium and also went close. ""I think we were better than Portugal,"" said Spain coach Luis Enrique. ""For sure they had two shots on the break that hit the bar and one that Kepa saved but we had chances as well."" Both sit top of their Nations League groups, Portugal with maximum points after beating Croatia and Sweden while Spain have four after thrashing Ukraine and drawing with Germany. Germany coach Joachim Loew bemoaned his side's inability to hold on to a lead after they conceded a last-gasp equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw against Turkey. Stuttgart-born Kenan Karaman bundled in a late leveller against the country of his birth as Turkey fought back from behind three times to snatch a draw and leave Loew scratching his head. ""I'm disappointed and frustrated. We have had this problem for a while, and the same thing happened in other games,"" the Germany coach told broadcaster RTL. The draw was Germany's third in three games, and the third time in a row that they have failed to win after taking the lead. Veteran striker Francesco Caputo scored on his Italy debut with Stephan El Shaarawy adding a brace as an experimental Azzurri side crushed Moldova 6-0. Roberto Mancini lined out with Italy's 'B' side without their stars as the Italians build towards next year's European championships, having failed to reach the 2018 World Cup. Against the modest Moldovans the Italians extended Mancini's unbeaten run to 17 consecutive games, with 14 wins and three draws. ""I've seen so many interesting things,"" said Mancini, whose side were five goals up at the break. Italy, top of their Nations Leagues group with four points, play in Poland on Sunday and the Netherlands in Bergamo next Wednesday, with both on three points. "
"PARIS: Long-term exposure to air pollution may be linked to 15% of Covid-19 deaths globally, according to research published on Tuesday that highlights the health risks posed by greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers, including those from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Germany, found that in Europe the proportion of Covid deaths linked to air pollution was about 19%, in North America it was 17%, and in East Asia about 27%. The study, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, is the first to estimate the proportion of Covid deaths that could be attributed to the exacerbating effects of air pollution for every country in the world. The researchers used epidemiological data from previous US and Chinese studies of air pollution and Covid-19 and Sars outbreak in 2003. They combined this with satellite data showing global exposure to polluting fine particles known as âparticulate matterâ that are less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter (known as PM2.5), information on atmospheric conditions and ground-based pollution monitoring networks. The team noted that particulate matter appeared to increase the activity of a receptor on lung cell surfaces, ACE-2, which is known to be involved in the way Covid-19 infects patients. âSo we have a double hit: air pollution damages the lungs and increases the activity of ACE-2, which in turn leads to enhanced uptake of virus,â the study said. Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry said âthe pollution particles are a co-factor in aggravating the diseaseâ. He said their estimates suggested that over 6,100 Covid deaths in UK and around 40,000 in US could be attributed to air pollution. "
"BERLIN: German clubs and the national team will need to learn to rotate if the players are to remain fit and healthy in an unusually busy season and perform at a top level in next year's European Championship, Germany coach Joachim Loew said on Tuesday. The Germans have firmly set their sights on next year's Euros as they aim to make up for a disappointing 2018 World Cup. ""For the players this season will be one of high and unusual strain,"" Loew told a news conference. ""We have never had a season like this one. ""We have to ration, to rotate if the players are to remain continuously at the top quality level all the way to the tournament next year. If we are not careful we will not be happy next year."" Germany host Turkey in a friendly on Wednesday before visiting Ukraine on Oct. 10 and then welcome Switzerland three days later in the Nations League. The game against Turkey in Cologne will not have more than 300 fans due to rising novel coronavirus infection rates in the North Rhine-Westphalia region. Players will return to club duty in the domestic and European leagues with Germany also having a shortened winter break this season due to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Against Turkey, Loew will not use any Bayern Munich or RB Leipzig players, who were in action in the Champions League as late as August before the start of the new season in September, in order to rest them. ""The health of players is paramount this season,"" he said. ""We have to do a big stretch this autumn because now we have those weeks with continuous play."" "
"LONDON: The political bromance between Boris Johnson and Donald Trump leaves Britain and its transatlantic ""special relationship"" exposed if Joe Biden wins next week, just as the country needs all the friends it can get. The UK is divorcing the European Union and looking to revitalise partnerships elsewhere, but has managed to antagonise President Trump's Democratic opponent over its Brexit plans for Northern Ireland. French President Emmanuel Macron has at times also strived to keep Trump close. But the British prime minister is more closely associated with his fellow convention-shredding populist in Washington. ""There is a lot of frantic repositioning going on at the moment here in London by this administration in Britain,"" former Conservative finance minister George Osborne told CNN on Sunday. ""But I don't think Joe Biden will feel particularly warmly toward this British government, and they're going to have to work very hard to change that,"" he said. Last December, as Johnson closed in on a general election victory, Biden showed his disdain in describing the Conservative politician as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Trump. The president has himself praised Johnson as ""Britain('s) Trump"", and the prime minister's own long trail of provocative comments has come back to haunt him. Biden was vice president to Barack Obama when Johnson, in 2016, wrote that Obama was anti-UK owing to his ""part-Kenyan"" heritage and ""ancestral dislike of the British Empire"". That remark was highlighted recently on Twitter by Obama's deputy national security advisor, Ben Rhodes, who sees Johnson as Trump ""with better hair"" and a higher IQ. Many veterans of the Obama administration are likely to populate a Biden White House. If elected, it will be up to Biden and his team to decide whether ""to litigate and punish the past or focus on the future"", according to Heather Conley, director of the Europe programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""I am comforted that populists are chameleons: they take on the hue of the political moment. I trust should vice president Biden win, Mr Johnson's hue will change dramatically,"" she told AFP. Trump's relationship with previous British prime minister Theresa May was awful. But he was effusive about the New York-born Johnson when the ""tough"" and ""smart"" former foreign secretary replaced her last year. Johnson in turn has lauded Trump's ""many, many good qualities"", in marked contrast to the arm's-length mistrust displayed by others such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Yet Britain, next year's president of the G7, remains far more aligned with France and Germany -- as well as Biden -- on climate change, Iran, Russia and collective defence under the NATO umbrella. A post-Brexit US-UK trade deal is still a work in progress under Trump, who characteristically is said to be driving a hard bargain after slapping tariffs on Scottish whisky amid a wider spat with the EU. Conley said that Biden, as a ""dedicated transatlanticist"", was likely to resolve Trump's trade row with the EU and Britain, as part of a wider fence-mending policy if elected. ""But certainly issues related to Brexit are going to be addressed much differently in a Biden administration than the Brexit enthusiasm of the Trump administration -- and even that hasn't been easy going,"" the expert added. The US-UK trade negotiation has been attracting close attention from Democrats, since Johnson in September introduced legislation that unilaterally strips Brussels of a role in regulating future trade between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. Biden, who speaks passionately of his Irish roots, warned that the trade deal would be dead on arrival if Britain, via its Brexit policy, undermines Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement. In public, the British government refuses to take sides in the November 3 US election. But some Conservatives are showing no such reserve. In 1992, Johnson's former finance minister Sajid Javid moved to New York to work as a banker. Writing in the Daily Telegraph last week, he reflected on hearing Ronald Reagan's final speech to the Republican convention that summer. The former president appealed to ""your best hopes, not your worst fears"", Javid said. ""Only one of the candidates can credibly say the same. Britain is better off with Biden."" "
"BERLIN: The home match against the Spanish on September 3 in the Nations League A will be the first time Germany has played in 2020 after friendlies against Spain and Italy were cancelled in March, as was May's away match against Switzerland. ""After the long break, it is incredibly important for our young team to be able to play again and prepare for the postponed 2020 European Championships,"" said Germany team director Oliver Bierhoff in a statement. Visitors Spain will play hosts Germany in Enrique's first game since being reappointed Spanish head coach. Three days later, the Germans face Switzerland in Basel in the Nations League. In October, Germany will be based in Cologne and play three games in six days with a friendly against an unnamed opponent in Cologne on October 7, Ukraine away three days later in the Nations League, before hosting the Swiss Cologne on October 13. In November, the team moves to Leipzig which will host a friendly against an unnamed opponent on November 11, then Ukraine three days later in the Nations League before the Germans final match of 2020 away to Spain on November 17. ""By choosing the venues, we are avoiding unnecessary travel, protecting the health of the players and keeping an eye on the issue of load management,"" Bierhoff said. "
"COIMBATORE: An 18-year-old student of NIFT-TEA College of Knitwear Fashion in Tirupur has recreated Guernica, Spanish artist Pablo Picassoâs 1937 masterpiece, on the occasion of his birth anniversary on Sunday. It took M Sneha Adriana, a Ist year BSc Apparel Fashion Designing student, two weeks to finish the anti-war painting. âEven though I had not done any major paintings earlier, I agreed when my professor asked me to do it. As days passed, I grew impatient and often felt disappointed because I could complete only a portion even after spending several hours. I am glad I didn't give up,â Sneha told TOI. Picasso had painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the bombing of Guernica, a town in northern Spain, by Germany and Italy. The 3.49m x 7.76m oil-on-canvas painting portrayed the horrors of war, in particular its impact on non-combatants and innocents women, children and animals. The idea of recreating a Picasso painting as a tribute to him on his birth anniversary was conceived two weeks ago, said assistant professor G Boopathy Vijay. âHis works have been a great source of inspiration. We wanted one painter to do it to ensure that the strokes are uniform. After the meaning of the painting was explained to Sneha, she started recreating it on her own. It was done with acrylic paints on a 3.49 ft X 7.76ft art paper.â She spent a lot of time to get the minute details and shades right, Sneha said. âSome days, I used to work till 5am without break. I am really happy with the outcome and am confident of taking up similar works,â she added. "
"NEW DELHI: A âspecial arrangementâ aerial connectivity could roll out between India and the US, France and Germany within a week. Airlines of both sides will be allowed to operate flights and carry passengers in and out of India who are eligible to do so under the home ministry rules, said people in the know. It is reliably learnt that talks with US, France and Germany are at a very advanced stage and announcements could come within a week. Separately, India is in discussion with UAE also to facilitate the travel of people from here. India had recently spoken of creating travel corridors with US, UK, France and Germany to facilitate travel during the pandemic and till schedule flights are resumed. With the Gulf, arrangements are being to operate charter flights to allow both way travel of eligible people. At the moment airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and United are allowed to operate repatriation flights mainly to fly eligible people out of India. But under the special arrangement, travellers â as per the MHA travel eligibility order â will be able to fly both in and out of India on airlines of India and Germany, France and America. For instance, Lufthansa website says âas per the approval given by the Director General of Civil Aviation, only the following persons shall be allowed to travel on the special repatriation fights: All German and EU nationals/residents; all other foreign nationals transiting through a Lufthansa hubâ¦ and Indian nationals holding US green cards or Canadian permanent residence status are only permitted on this special repatriation flight if he/she is a spouse of US/Canadian national.â Once this arrangement is made with other countries, their airlines will also reciprocally carry traffic in and out of India as per MHA directives. People in the know say announcements to the effect with some countries could start coming this week itself. Scheduled international passenger flights were suspended on March 22 and are for now not allowed till the month-end except on certain routes that the government may specifically allow. Air India has been operating repatriation flights under Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) since May 6, primarily to bring back Indians stranded abroad and has flown back thousands of people so far. AI had been flying people on VBM flights out of India to certain countries like US, Germany, UK and France (till recently) who were allowing incoming traffic. VBM is now the worldâs largest repatriation exercise with private Indian airlines also participating. In recent weeks, US, France and Germany have asked India to allow their airlines to operate flights like AIâs VBM. France has stopped allowing people to fly on VBM flights to Paris and US has said unless the issue is resolved, AI will need permission to operate the VBM flights to the country from later this month. The special arrangement being made will allow people to travel between India and countries like US, Germany and France. The MHA currently allows certain categories of foreign nationals, including overseas citizens of India (OCI) cardholders, to enter India. These include foreign nationals married to Indian citizens; foreign national student with one parent being an OCI card holder or an Indian citizen; minor children who have OCI cards and whose parents are Indian citizens and OCI card holders who need to come here due to family emergencies.

"BERLIN: Germany is determined to expand its attempts to regulate online hate speech even as Facebook promises to do more to clean up its site after a global advertiser boycott, with politicians saying the issue is too important to leave to self-regulation. A German law in force since 2018 demands that social networks delete or block obviously criminal content within 24 hours of receiving a complaint or face a hefty fine. The legislation has been closely watched as concerns mount globally about hateful posts, but it has had a limited impact so far and has not stopped online hate speech in Germany, blamed for helping to fuel a wave of racist attacks in the last year. ""We can't tell if there is a positive effect due to the law or due to the general debate right now,"" said AmÃ©lie Heldt, a researcher at the Leibniz Institute for Media Research, Hamburg. The law did help encourage social media companies to invest more in policing content on their sites: Facebook now has some 2,000 content reviewers in Germany out of a global total of about 15,000, although they also check posts in other languages. Facebook reported removing 1,392 posts in 2019 due to the law, about a third of the complaints it received, far fewer than the more than quarter of a million complaints reported by Twitter and Google's YouTube video service. German authorities last year fined Facebook 2 million euros ($2.3 million) for under-reporting complaints, saying the site makes it harder for users to report posts under the German law than under the social network's own community standards. Globally, Facebook said it took action on 5.7 million pieces of content it detected as hate speech in the fourth quarter of 2019, rising to 9.6 million in the first quarter of this year, with 90% detected and deleted before they were reported by users. Facebook has promised to do more to find and remove hateful content, but US organizers of the growing advertising boycott said on Tuesday they saw ""no commitment to action"" after meeting with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg. Germany wants to keep up the pressure. As part of its six-month presidency of the European Union, Berlin called for more action at a meeting on Monday of the bloc's justice ministers. ""We cannot accept the public debate being distorted and poisoned,"" said German Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht. ""Voluntary commitments and self-responsibility are not enough."" The German parliament last month agreed a new package of measures to fight far-right extremism and online hatred, including an obligation for social networks to report suspected criminal content to a new office under the federal prosecutors. Free speech advocates have criticised the original law for pushing decisions about what counts as criminal speech on to private companies. ""You can't outsource criminal law,"" said Anke Domscheit-Berg, a left-wing opposition lawmaker. ""We need better qualified and resourced police... but that doesn't mean we should remove responsibility from Facebook."" Facebook declined to comment. The German internet industry association Eco, which counts Facebook as a member, said regulating platforms would not fix the bigger social problem of increased racism and populism. ""Criminal prosecution remains the responsibility of the state. Providers must not be made sheriffs of the state,"" said Alexander Rabe, Eco managing director. But Markus Beckedahl, the founder of digital news portal netzpolitik.de and an activist on Internet regulation, said European action was urgently needed, given the power of social media giants. ""What we really need is strong regulation - like what we have for the food industry and other sectors,"" he said. "
"BERLIN: Germany head coach Joachim Loew on Friday nominated a 29-man squad - including five from European champions Bayern Munich - for October internationals against Turkey, Switzerland and Ukraine. The Germans twice threw away the lead last month in 1-1 draws against both Spain and Switzerland in the Nations League. ""We've selected an expanded squad that gives us enough options for the three games,"" explained Loew. He said he intends to divide his squad into two separate groups, the first for the home friendly against Turkey in Cologne next Wednesday. The second, including many of his first-choice stars, will be used for Nations League games against Ukraine in Kiev, then against Switzerland back in Cologne. Real Madrid star Toni Kroos has been selected even though he has a thigh injury. Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been left out after testing positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago. ""The players will arrive in two stages and we basically plan with two different teams,"" Loew added. ""The players from Munich and Leipzig as well as Toni Kroos, will only join us later and start training on Wednesday. ""I am not planning to use them for the game against Turkey."" Loew has included two newcomers in midfielders Mahmoud Dahoud from Borussia Dortmund and Moenchengladbach's Jonas Hofmann. Germany captain Manuel Neuer, as well as fellow Bayern stars Joshua Kimmich, Serge Gnabry, Niklas Suele and Leon Goretzka have been included. Loew has admitted to an ""uneasy feeling"" about the away game a week on Saturday in Kiev amid the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Germans intend to spend 36-hours in the Ukraine, taking only the matchday squad to Kiev. Germany squadGoalkeepers: Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Bernd Leno (Arsenal/ENG), Kevin Trapp (Eintracht Frankfurt) Defence: Emre Can (Borussia Dortmund), Matthias Ginter (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Robin Gosens (Atalanta/ITA), Marcel Halstenberg, Benjamin Henrichs, Lukas Klostermann (all RB Leipzig), Robin Koch (Leeds United/ENG), Antonio Ruediger (Chelsea/ENG), Nico Schulz (Borussia Dortmund), Niklas Stark (Hertha Berlin), Niklas Suele (Bayern Munich), Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen) Midfielders: Nadiem Amiri (Bayer Leverkusen), Julian Brandt, Mahmoud Dahoud (both Borussia Dortmund), Julian Draxler (Paris St. Germain), Serge Gnabry, Leon Goretzka (both Bayern Munich), Kai Havertz (Chelsea), Jonas Hofmann (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Joshua Kimmich (Bayern Munich), Toni Kroos (Real Madrid/ESP), Florian Neuhaus (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Suat Serdar (Schalke 04) Strikers: Luca Waldschmidt (Benfica/POR), Timo Werner (Chelsea/ENG) "
"BERLIN: Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig players, who were rested for Germany's previous set of international matches last month, were called up on Friday for their upcoming Nations League games with coach Joachim Loew naming a 29-man squad. Among those returning are Bayern's Manuel Neuer, Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka and Serge Gnabry as well as Leipzig's Marcel Halstenberg and Lukas Klostermann. These players along with Real Madrid's Toni Kroos will only play in their two Nations League qualifiers against Ukraine on Oct. 10 and Switzerland three days later. They will not feature in Wednesday's friendly against Turkey with Loew taking into consideration the busy season they have ahead of them for both club and country. Loew had rested them in September following the clubs' runs in the Champions League with Bayern clinching the title in August and Leipzig reaching the semi-finals. The Germans play Turkey on Oct. 7 in a friendly before travelling to Ukraine three days later and then hosting the Swiss in their two Nations League group matches. Borussia Dortmund's Mahmoud Dahoud and Borussia Moenchengladbach's Jonas Hofmann earned their first callups in Loew's enlarged squad. Germany are still without a win in League A Group 4, sitting in third place on two points from two games, one point behind Ukraine and two off leaders Spain. "
"JALANDHAR: All Indian embassies and consulates across the world are seeking and collecting details of the Sikh diaspora in their areas, particularly in countries where the presence of Sikh community is substantial. This was revealed when an email from the office of the Consul-General of India in Hamburg, Germany, seeking details of the Sikh diaspora in the country became public. However, MEA has claimed the collection of data was a âreach out effort worldwideâ to help the Sikh community as there have been complaints of persecution of the Sikh minorities in some countries. Hamburg vice consul Gulshan Dhingra had on October 19 sent out an email from the official account linked to the CGI office, titled âData of Sikh Diaspora residing in the 4 North German States.â As per the email, âThe ministry is in the process of compiling the data of Sikh diaspora residing in Germany.â The recipients of the email were urged to âcompile a list with the names and addresses of Sikhs living in your area for onward transmission to the ministryâ by October 21, 2020.

However, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) has claimed the collection of the data was a âreach out effort worldwideâ to help the Sikh community as there have been complaints of persecution of the Sikh minorities in some countries. Europe-based lawyer and activist Dr Manuvie made the email from office of Consulate General Of India, Hamburg, public on her Twitter handle on Wednesday night and asked piercing questions to the Hamburg Consul General of India Madan Lal Raigar. Several other Twitter users also raised strong questions about the move and criticized it. Hamburg vice consul Gulshan Dhingra had on October 19 sent out an email from the official account linked to the CGI office, titled âData of Sikh Diaspora residing in the 4 North German States.â According to the email, âThe ministry is in the process of compiling the data of Sikh diaspora residing in Germany.â The recipients of the email were urged to âcompile a list with the names and addresses of Sikhs living in your area for onward transmission to the ministryâ by October 21, 2020. Later, CGI Raigar told TOI that the letter had been withdrawn as it had created an unnecessary controversy and also sent an official version of MEA on the issue. Dr Manuvie had questioned the CGI on official Twitter handle @IndiainHamburg for sending the email as âhigh priorityâ one and flagged the issues of data protection and legal issues involved in such data collection in Germany, which has strict privacy laws. CGI Madan Lal Raigar forwarded the official version of the ministry of external affairs (MEA) on the issue to TOI. This communique denied any mala-ide intention and said that everything was being done benevolently. âThe government, through its embassies/consulates abroad, periodically updates data regarding Indian diaspora to carry its reach-out efforts towards them with good intentions to help them out in need/distress situations; and never to harm or hurt sentiments of the community at large. This is done for the entire Indian diaspora (irrespective of race, region, religion, etc.),â according to the MEA explanation. âThis was not done selectively by the Indian consulate in Hamburg only but it was a reach out effort world-wide by all Indian embassies and consulates abroad, in general, and, more emphasis was in the countries where presence of Sikh diaspora is substantial,â the statement said and added âIt is regrettable, sad and unfortunate that the issue has been blown out of proportion unnecessarily to ignite sentiments of the diaspora.â Already cases of spying on Sikhs in GermanyThere have already been cases of spying on Sikhs in Germany and in two of these three persons were convicted by the local courts there. In the third case, hearing is already on in a Frankfurt court. In 2014, a Sikh was convicted and sentenced to nine months in jail by a German court for spying on Sikhs there. In December last year, a Frankfurt court had convicted an Indian Sikh couple of spying on Sikhs there. In this case, federal prosecutors in Germany had said the man had been providing information to Indianâs R&AW from January 2015 onwards and in July 2017, his wife also started working for the spy agency. The third case involves an Indian Sikh being tried for spying on Sikhs and Kashmiris. Sikhs worried about âBlack ListâThe Sikh communityâs apprehensions can be assessed against the backdrop of the âBlack Listâ of Sikhs maintained by India, especially of those living abroad. This âBlack Listâ had no transparency about the names in it and the criteria. Though different numbers were reported, in September last year, just before 550th Parkash Utsav of Guru Nanak, it was reported that out of 314 names, 312 names had been removed. There has been no clarity about the remaining two names. "
"BERLIN: Egypt, France, Germany and Jordan on Tuesday warned Israel against annexing parts of the Palestinian territories, saying that doing so could have consequences for bilateral relations. In a statement distributed by the German Foreign Ministry, the countries, including Israel's two leading partners in the Middle East, said their foreign ministers had discussed how to restart talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. They, along with most other European countries, oppose Israeli plans that envisage annexing parts of the occupied West Bank as part of a peace deal that is promoted by the US administration of President Donald Trump. The Palestinian Authority, which wants the West Bank for a future Palestinian state, opposes the move. The United States has yet to give its approval to the annexation plans. ""We concur that any annexation of Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 would be a violation of international law and imperil the foundations of the peace process,"" the European and Middle Eastern foreign ministers said after their video conference. ""We would not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders that are not agreed by both parties in the conflict,"" they added. ""It could also have consequences for the relationship with Israel."" Israel had no immediate response. But in a separate statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had told British counterpart Boris Johnson on Monday that he was committed to Trump's ""realistic"" peace plan. ""Israel is prepared to conduct negotiations on the basis of President Trumpâs peace plan, which is both creative and realistic, and will not return to the failed formulas of the past,"" the statement said. "
"WASHINGTON: As Joe Biden hopscotched through Iowa and New Hampshire in late 2019, he also name-dropped his way across the globe. China's Xi Jinping. German chancellor Angela Merkel. Vladimir Putin of Russia. ""I've met every major world leader for the last 40 years,"" the former vice president and eventual Democratic presidential nominee said. Behind the braggadocio was something Biden saw as a chief selling point for his third White House bid: His decades as a leading senator and two-term vice president make him ""ready on day one"" to restore a world order he believes President Donald Trump has destabilized. Biden's foreign policy credentials have largely been overshadowed by questions about how he would lead the US through the worst pandemic in a century. But the issue could reemerge Thursday as Trump and Biden take the stage for a final debate, with a topic list including national security. Both campaigns believe their competing approaches â Trump's ""America First"" doctrine that he says ended an era of other nations taking advantage of the United States; Biden's pledge to reinvigorate a network of Western democracies â can sway voters. ""The 800-pound gorilla that will be making its presence felt on January 21 is still going to be Covid-19,"" said Tony Blinken, Biden's top foreign policy adviser, describing the pandemic as ""the first big national security challenge"" that would require Biden to make good on his promise of better coordination among the US and its allies. But, Blinken said, ""The world doesn't stop just because we have this Covid crisis. We would have to walk and chew a lot of gum at the same time."" Biden blisters Trump on everything from his hard-line immigration policies and dismissing the climate crisis to criticizing Nato allies and ""embracing"" Putin and North Korea's authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un. In an ABC News town hall last week, Biden credited Trump for recently cementing diplomatic ties between Israel and two Arab neighbors: Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. But, Biden said, the President still has ""no coherent plan for foreign policy"" beyond ""America alone."" Trump counters that ""America First"" is more than sloganeering. He won a rewrite of the North American free trade agreement, curtailed legal immigration, wielded tariff powers and insists he's staring down Beijing's Xi on trade â efforts he frames as benefiting American workers. Yet heading into the final debate, Trump's loudest foreign policy pitch isn't about his record. It's casting Biden as corrupt because of his son Hunter's business associations in Ukraine and China. The President has promoted an unconfirmed New York Post report published last week that cites an email in which an official from Ukrainian gas company Burisma thanked Hunter Biden, who served on the company's board, for arranging for him to meet Joe Biden during a 2015 visit to Washington. The Biden campaign has rejected Trump's assertion of wrongdoing and noted that Biden's schedule did not show a meeting with the Burisma official. Once the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, Biden hails from the bipartisan establishment that shaped US international policy from World War II's end until Trump's election. Biden sees the international order established over that span â Nato, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization â as anchoring global stability, with the US leading as the world's democratic superpower, rivaled only by one-party China. Trump eschews those institutions and their multilateral efforts. He's withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization, the Paris accords to reduce carbon pollution worldwide and a multinational deal that limited Iran's nuclear program. He's pledged to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany, a notable retreat from the post-WWII framework. To Biden, those moves invite Russian aggression in Europe and an unchecked Beijing. Trump undoubtedly has been an international force. His Nafta overhaul drew bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. The latest Middle East deal is a historic step, though it doesn't address the region's biggest unresolved matters: the Syrian civil war, Iran's nuclear ambitions and the land dispute between Israel and the Palestinians. Biden has promised immediate changes. He'd recommit to the Paris accords while rejoining WHO and restoring its US financial support. He's pledged to reverse Trump's executive actions limiting travel from certain Muslim nations and curtailing the US asylum program for refugees. He'd restore foreign aid programs to other Western Hemisphere nations, especially in Central America, where economic and political instability drive migration patterns to the US Aides said Biden would likely halt troop reductions in Europe, believing those postings are fundamental to the US commitment to Nato and containment of Russian ambitions on the continent. Biden also promises to confront Putin, whom he describes as a ""thug,"" over interference in US elections via social media and other means. Trump has publicly rejected US intelligence findings that Russia interfered in 2016 and is doing so again in 2020 in ways intended to help Trump. "
A group of professional tennis players led by Dustin Brown will meet in a series of exhibition tournaments in Germany starting Friday. The live-streamed event will take place at an academy near the small town of Hohr-Grenzhausen. The men's and women's professional tours are currently suspended until July because of the coronavirus pandemic. Brown is from Germany and his father is Jamaican. He upset Rafal Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon in 2015. Brown says on the event's website he is ``happy to have the chance to compete again. ... I am looking forward to going out there doing what I love.'' The shortened matches will be best of three with four games to win a set. Tiebreakers will be played at 3-3.

"BERLIN: Germany has issued international arrest warrants for the two founders of the firm at the centre of the tax haven scandal exposed by the Panama Papers data leak, German media reported. Mossack Fonseca founders Juergen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, suspected of tax evasion and associating with criminals, will be arrested if they enter the European Union, German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported late Monday. The two men hold Panamanian passports and are currently in the Caribbean archipelago which does not have any extradition treaties, the newspaper said. However investigators hope that Mossack, who has family in Germany, may surrender to officials in order to negotiate a reduced sentence and avoid US charges. The Panama Papers, a massive data leak in April 2016, exposed widespread tax avoidance and evasion using complex structures of offshore shell companies and caused an international outcry. At least 150 investigations have been opened in 79 countries to examine potential tax evasion or money laundering, according to the American Center for Public Integrity. In 2018, Mossack Fonseca said it would close due to ""irreparable damage"" to its reputation. Panama's government meanwhile continues to petition the international community to remove it from several tax haven blacklists. "

"If you ever happen to visit the moon, then you may be able to tweet photos from there and you should thank Nokia (networks division) for it. Nokia is working on a project to introduce a 4G cellular communications network on the Moon. The company has shown interest in bringing high-speed cellular connectivity to the Moon in the past as well but now NASA has decided to give Nokia $14.1 million for the same. To clarify it is Nokia of America Corporation that is getting the money as NASA has exclusively listed out American companies for the mission. NASA has selected 14 American companies, including several small businesses, as partners to develop a range of technologies that will help forge a path to sustainable Artemis operations on the Moon by the end of the decade. NASA is spending $370 million for the same and Nokia just got $14.1 million to develop 4G infrastructure for the Moon. So, why is NASA spending so much for the Moon? It is simply because NASA wants to âbuild up an array of mission-ready capabilities to support a sustainable presence on the Moon and future human missions to Mars,â as per an official statement. âThe majority of the funding will help mature cryogenic fluid management technologies via in-space demonstrations led by small business Eta Space, Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, and ULA,â it added. As per a report by United Press International, ""The system (developed by Nokia) could support lunar surface communications at greater distances, increased speeds and provide more reliability than current standards.â But before you get all excited, note that Nokia had announced a similar partnership with Vodafone Germany back in 2018 and claimed that the partnership would bring 4G coverage to the Moon by 2019. But as we all know this is yet to be a reality. "
"FRANKFURT am MAIN: Germany takes over the European Union's six-month presidency Wednesday, with outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel staking her legacy on a massive economic recovery plan to help the bloc cope with the coronavirus fallout. Merkel's last major role on the international stage comes as the 27-member club faces its deepest recession since World War II, triggered by a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 people globally. The crisis has galvanised Europe's most powerful leader who, with just over a year left in her final term, has ditched her usual wait-and-see approach to call for ""extraordinary measures"" to weather the storm. ""Europe's future is our future,"" Merkel said Monday as she stood beside French President Emmanuel Macron to push for a 750-billion-euro ($843 billion) coronavirus recovery fund. The proposed fund would controversially be financed through shared EU borrowing and marks a stunning U-turn for Germany after years of opposition to debt pooling. The EU's rotating presidency is Merkel's ""last chance"" to make her mark as one of Europe's great leaders, Der Spiegel weekly wrote, adding that it was time for Germany to shoulder more responsibility as the bloc's biggest nation and top economy. ""For years the chancellor put off dealing with the chronic problems of the EU and the euro. Now, towards the end of her political career, she has the opportunity to make up for past mistakes,"" Spiegel wrote. There will be no shortage of challenges to tackle in the months ahead. Post-Brexit negotiations, a more assertive China, rocky transatlantic ties, climate change and the conflicts in Libya and Syria will all be jostling for attention, even if the pandemic promises to dominate the agenda. Germany kicked off its EU custodianship by projecting the words ""Together for Europe's recovery"" onto Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate late Tuesday. After 15 years in office, Merkel is the bloc's longest-serving leader and held the EU presidency once before, in 2007. But the stakes are higher this time. A first major test will come at a July 17-18 EU summit, where Merkel hopes leaders will reach an agreement on the 750-billion-euro rescue fund put forward by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen -- Merkel's former defence minister. The money is expected to come mainly in the form of grants for countries hardest hit by the pandemic, such as debt-laden Italy and Spain. But so-called frugal nations including Austria and the Netherlands want to reign in the spending and are insisting on loans rather than grants. Merkel has urged holdout nations to ""engage in an extraordinary act of solidarity"", warning that an uneven recovery could undermine the EU single market and end up harming stronger economies too. ""We hope we can find a solution, even if the road is still long,"" Merkel said at the press conference alongside Macron. The fund is based on an idea unveiled by the French-German duo in May, in which the European Commission would raise money on the financial markets to help pay for the post-pandemic recovery in poorer member states. If accepted, the rescue fund would be a milestone for EU unity. It would also be a big win for Berlin, and could ease some of the lingering resentment from the eurozone debt crisis a decade ago when Merkel's government insisted on harsh austerity for struggling nations like Greece. Another contentious issue that could define Germany's EU presidency is Brexit. After weeks of standstill, Britain and the EU have resumed negotiations about the country's divorce deal with the bloc -- which could still result in a hard Brexit at the end of the year. In an interview with several newspapers last week, Merkel warned that Britain would ""have to live with the consequences"" of having weaker economic ties with the EU. "
"BERLIN: Large-scale public events such as football matches will remain banned in Germany until August 31 due to the coronavirus crisis, Berlin said on Wednesday, though it did not rule out allowing Bundesliga games to continue behind closed doors. ""Big events play a large role in the infection dynamic, and will therefore remain forbidden until August 31,"" German leaders said in a statement after Angela Merkel met with regional state premiers to discuss relaxing restrictions on Wednesday. The decision means supporters will not be allowed into German stadiums until at least September, though Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder insisted games behind closed doors -- known as ""ghost games"" -- were still an option. ""The Bundesliga was not a topic of discussion today. The league itself is working on security concepts and it will definitely be something to be talked about soon: whether and in what form games behind closed doors will be possible,"" said Soeder. The German top-flight is currently suspended until April 30, though most teams resumed training in small groups last week. The German Football League (DFL) is set to meet on April 23 to discuss next steps, and is determined to finish the season by June 30 to ensure its clubs do not lose out on crucial TV rights revenue. Yet the current plan to resume with weekly games behind closed doors from early May has been met with criticism. Fan groups and medical experts have slammed the plan, pointing out it would rely on in-demand testing capacities being diverted to footballers. "
The BMW International Open in Germany and the Open de France golf tournaments have been cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic and the Scottish Open has been postponed. The BMW International Open was to be played in Munich from June 25-28 and the Open de France was scheduled to take place a week later. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has banned large public gatherings in the country through August 31 and the French government has done the same until mid-July. The Scottish Open was scheduled to be played from July 9-12. Discussions on a rescheduled date are ongoing. 
"BERLIN: German authorities on Tuesday ordered a new lockdown for an entire district -- the first since easing coronavirus restrictions and a major setback to hopes of a swift return to normality. ""For the first time in Germany, we will return an entire district to the measures that applied several weeks ago,"" Armin Laschet, state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, said. ""We will reintroduce a lockdown in the district of Guetersloh,"" he said, adding that the restrictions that cover 360,000 people and will be valid until at least June 30. The move came after a coronavirus outbreak at a slaughterhouse in the town of Rheda-Wiedenbrueck that has left more than 1,500 workers out of a total of nearly 7,000 infected. The outbreak in Germany's most populous state is the biggest since the country began lifting the lockdown in early May. The new lockdown means a return to measures first introduced in March, with cinemas, museums, concert halls, bars, gyms, swimming pools and saunas shut down, Laschet said. Several outbreaks at slaughterhouses, not just in Germany but also in France, have put a spotlight on the working and housing conditions facing the workers -- many of whom come from Romania or Bulgaria. But Germany has also seen new coronavirus clusters in residential buildings in Lower Saxony and Berlin, where 370 families living in high-rise flats were placed under quarantine in one neighbourhood last week. With new infection rates sharply down from highs in March and a death toll significantly lower than those of its neighbours, Germany became the first major EU country to begin easing virus restrictions about seven weeks ago. But Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly warned against complacency before a viable vaccine is found. "
"BERLIN: Hundreds of people ran riot in Germany's Stuttgart city centre in the early hours of Sunday, throwing stones and bottles at police and plundering stores after smashing shop windows. Several arrests were made, a police spokesman told AFP, adding that he did not have a firm figure of the number detained.  Some police officers were also hurt, he said.  Tensions built up shortly after midnight when increasing numbers of people began gathering close to the city's biggest square, the Schlossplatz. Clashes then broke out between several small groups, with police estimating around 500 people were involved.  Shops along the neighbouring Koenigstrasse, a key shopping thoroughfare, were attacked and looted.  Police called in reinforcements and said they could not immediately give a reason for the outbreak of violence.  Videos posted on Twitter showed people breaking shop windows, with their goods strewn on the streets.  A jewellery store was completely emptied and a mobile phone shop wrecked, according to regional broadcaster SWR.  Smaller scale clashes had broken out downtown last week between police and groups of young people. "
"BERLIN: Police in southern Germany say a woman got a shock while airing out her home when a 25-centimeter (10-inch) Chinese mitten crab scurried in from the terrace through the open door.  Freiburg police said Thursday that they received a call reporting the unwanted home invader in the nearby town of Unterlauchringen, near the Swiss border, the previous morning.  Before they arrived, police say, the woman captured the crustacean by putting an upside-down garbage can on top of it.  Officers were able to put the crab into a container and then take it to a local veterinary clinic.  The invasive species, native to Asia, is now found in many rivers in Germany, and the woman's residence was not far from the Rhine, though the Chinese mitten crab has never been reported in the area before. They're not considered dangerous. "
"NURBURGRING (Germany): Three names synonymous with glory and success will grab attention for contrasting reasons this weekend when the once-legendary Nurburgring hosts a Formula One race for the first time in seven years. Lewis Hamilton will be seeking, at the second attempt, to equal Michael Schumacher's record of 91 wins while the seven-time champion German's son Mick is set to make his F1 debut in Friday's opening practice with Alfa Romeo. Alongside them, Sebastian Vettel - the last winner at the historic venue in 2013 - will be bidding to avoid any banana skins as he embarks on his closing chapter with Ferrari, having admitted on Wednesday that his spell with the Italian team has been a failure. All three men and the rest of the travelling F1 circus are expected to face severely cold conditions with rain and low temperatures forecast for the weekend's inaugural Eifel Grand Prix. For Hamilton, there is more at stake than a chance to claim another record as he presses on in pursuit of equalling Schumacher's haul of seven drivers' championships. After his disappointment at the Russian Grand Prix, where he was handed two controversial five-second penalties on his way to a fighting third and a subsequent outburst, in which he claimed there was a conspiracy to slow him down, he will be seeking to reclaim his dominance and dignity. Like Vettel, he is a former winner at the track which, in a previous incarnation as the feared 'Nordschleife', witnessed the birth of the 'Silver Arrows' in 1934, when Manfred von Brauchitsch won the International Eifel Race. Itâs cold.Itâs wet. Guten Morgen from the NÃ¼rburgring! ð#EifelGP https://t.co/d7quwgqsx0— Mercedes-AMG F1 (@MercedesAMGF1) 1602143743000Hamilton triumphed in 2011 with McLaren, powered by a Mercedes engine, but he has not claimed victory in the Eifel mountains since joining the current Mercedes works team. Mercedes have registered only one F1 win at the venue - delivered on the daunting 'old' circuit by Juan-Manuel Fangio in 1954 - and may not find it easy this weekend despite their absolute dominance since the start of this Covid-19 affected season. Hamilton goes into the race with a 44-point lead in the drivers' title race ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who won in Sochi two weeks ago and remains determined to close the gap on the six-time champion. ""I won't give up and we'll keep pushing,"" he said, mindful that Hamilton is expected to react to his testy defeat in Russia, since when the defending champion has kept a low profile, with a typically inspired display. Formula Two championship leader Mick Schumacher will not be the only one of Ferrari's junior drivers in action at the German circuit as his rival and colleague Briton Callum Ilott is due to drive for Haas on Friday morning. Schumacher, 21, said it will be a special experience to make his debut on home German soil. He leads Ilott in the F2 title race and both will be vying to impress in the hope of landing an F1 seat next year. Ahead of his debut, Vettel gave Schumacher a warm welcome. ""It was surreal to see him in his father's Ferrari at Mugello,"" he said. ""He is just a nice young man and, knowing who his father is, and what he meant to me, it was very special. ""This situation is very difficult for him, but I think he is coping with it in a mature way for someone so young."" Schumacher added: ""It looks like it is going to be wet - every time I test a new car, it is always wet! I hope I can do a few laps and do my best."" Vettel, who regarded Michael Schumacher as his racing hero, said he had failed at Ferrari because he failed to win a title. ""That was my mission,"" he said. ""So, I have failed. I didn't manage to do that."" His former team Red Bull are likely to mount the main challenge to Hamilton and Bottas, in their 2020 'black arrows' cars, with Max Verstappen leading the way just days after engine-suppliers Honda announced they will withdraw from F1 next year.

"UNITED NATIONS: The UN Security Council should not be misused by countries with ""retaliatory intent to name innocent civilians as terrorist"" without credible evidence by invoking non-transparent working methods and procedures, India has said, referring to Pakistan's failed attempt to get four Indian nationals listed under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee. Pakistan had submitted the names of Indian nationals Angara Appaji, Gobinda Patnaik, Ajoy Mistry and Venumadhav Dongara for designation under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council. However, Pakistan's attempt was thwarted last month after the US, the UK, France, Germany and Belgium blocked the move in the Council to list Appaji and Patnaik. According to sources, no evidence was given by Pakistan in its case to get the individuals listed. Similarly, an earlier attempt by Pakistan to list Mistry and Dongara was blocked by the Council around June/July. ""We believe that UN Security Council continues to be an effective forum for the maintenance of international peace and security and combating terrorism. ""However, it should also be ensured that the forum is not misused by countries with retaliatory intent to name innocent civilians as terrorist without credible evidence by invoking non-transparent working methods and procedures,â First Secretary and Legal Adviser in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Yedla Umasankar said on Tuesday at the 6th Committee of the UN General Assembly on 'Measures to eliminate international terrorism'. Without naming Pakistan, he said, âIndia has been and continues to be a victim of terrorism sponsored across our borders. We have had firsthand experience of the cruel link between transnational organised crime and terrorism."" Umashankar said India condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and no cause whatsoever or grievance can justify terrorism, including state-sponsored cross-border terrorism. ""Our fight against terrorism should not only seek to eliminate terrorists and disrupt terror organisations/networks, but should also identify/hold accountable and take strong measures against states that encourage, support and finance terrorism, provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups,"" he said. Umasankar said the fight against terrorism has to be unrelenting and across all fronts and the flow of resources to terror linked entities needs to be completely stopped by collective inter-state efforts. âThe international community cannot and should not be selective in dealing with the terrorists groups or in dismantling terror infrastructure. India strongly condemns direct or indirect financial assistance provided by some States to terrorist groups and/or individuals members thereof,â he said. India also called on the need to work together to expose and destroy the linkages that exist between terrorists and their supporters. âWe need an international mechanism to ensure accountability and justice, enhanced dialogue and broaden understanding amongst member states,â Umasankar said. While the threat emanating from international terrorism is looming large, the inability of the UN to agree on a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism remains âone of the most glaring shortcomings"" in the international legislative framework, which could have boosted enforcement efforts to destroy safe havens of terrorists, their financial flows and their support networks, he noted. Umasankar also underscored the importance and need for early finalisation and conclusion of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), which will reflect the international community's commitment to cooperate in combating terrorism. He said with advancement in technology and an over flowing cyber world, terrorists are gaining access to infinite resources of âDO IT YOURSELFâ kits on issues ranging from making bombs to executing, beheadings besides securing communications and flow of funds. âThe proponents and perpetrators of these nefarious acts cleverly adopt emerging technologies for furthering their ideologies and accomplishing their evil acts,â Umasankar said. Asserting that the only effective way to tackle terrorism is by way of concerted international cooperation and genuine collaboration among the States, Umasankar said combined international efforts by way of extradition, prosecution, information exchange and capacity building go a long way in countering the menace of terrorism which is threatening the global community. Umasankar said normative efforts at the United Nations need to be coordinated through collaboration with other fora like Financial Action Task Force (FATF). He said the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) being discussed by the UN General Assembly over the last decade has resulted in little impact on the ground. He also stressed that while making every effort to combat terrorism, the UN and its member states should consider the rights of victims of terrorism and obligation of states towards the victims of terrorism under international law. âA vast majority of victims of terrorism are often women and children. It's high time for us to try and strengthen efforts to achieve the objective of putting in place a global legal framework in the form of CCIT to counter a global scourge. This will provide a legal basis for global fight against terrorism as all member states will have a multilateral platform to counter terrorism,â Umasankar said. "
"VILLARD DE LANS (France): Primoz Roglic maintained the overall lead in the Tour de France on Tuesday as Bora's German all-rounder Lennard Kamna won the medium mountain stage 16. Kamna came good after a long range breakaway, defeating Ineos rider Richard Carapaz over the final kilometres after the pair had been part of a rare large escape group. ð ð©ðª @lennardkaemna finally!ð ð©ðª Cette fois câest la bonne pour @lennardkaemna !#TDF2020 #TDFunited https://t.co/KkP9agQ8iQ— Tour de Franceâ¢ (@LeTour) 1600184185000The victory was just reward for the 24-year-old who was pipped to the line on the Puy Mary mountain last week. It was his first Tour de France stage win, and Bora's first of this Tour. Fifteen minutes further down the mountain the yellow jersey group ascended together with only Tadej Pogacar trying to upset Roglic and his Jumbo teammates. Colombia's Miguel Angel Lopez powered past them all over the final 200m but was followed closely over the line with no change at the top except for Nairo Quintana losing a little time. Roglic leads Pogacar by 40 seconds with five stages remaining. Rigoberto Uran is third at 1min 35sec, while Lopez and Britan Adam Yates round out the top five. "
"DELHI: The Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday sought stay of a high court order quashing its decision to impart primary education compulsorily through English medium saying it is the only means to mainstream poor and Dalit students, but the Supreme Court disagreed with the contention. Senior advocate K V Vishwanathan, appearing for the AP government, told a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramnian that the HC order quashing compulsory English medium instruction for students of Class 1to 6 would adversely impact hopes and aspirations of poor and Dalit students, who find it difficult in later life to compete with those educated in English medium schools. âThe high court struck down the decision even though 96% of parents want their children to be educated in English medium. Education through English medium would help the students, especially those from poor and backward classes to come up in life and compete confidently with others,"" Vishwanathan said. He said the state government had said that it would set up Telugu medium schools at Madal headquarters levels with transport facilities to help those students who wanted to study in their mother tongue. But the court was unimpressed. While adjourning hearing to next week, the bench said, ""It is not as simple as you put it. The questions arising from debate over English versus vernacular language are complex and there is no one answer to this. Only in a few countries, the medium of instruction in schools is through a foreign language, like in India. You go to China, France, Germany and other developed countries, the medium of instruction is always the mother tongue."" "
"Bayern Munich said on Sunday that players will return to training on Monday for the first time since the Bundesliga was suspended due to the coronavirus. Bayern led the table by four points when the season was halted on March 13. ""The Bayern Munich first team will return to training in small groups from Monday, April 6,"" said a statement from the club. ""This will be done in coordination with government policy and the relevant authorities. It goes without saying that all hygiene regulations will be strictly observed."" German football league officials had already advised a break in training until Sunday at the earliest. Bayern said that training will be held in private, with no members of the public allowed. ""In order to further slow the spread of the coronavirus, Bayern asks fans to continue to follow the instructions of the authorities and therefore please do not come to the Bayern training ground,"" added the statement.

"MOSCOW: Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he believed Russia's intelligence services had poisoned him with a Novichok nerve agent because authorities saw him as a threat ahead of next year's parliamentary elections. ""They understood that there were big, big problems threatening them ahead of elections for the State Duma,"" Navalny said in a YouTube interview with a Russian blogger, his first video appearance since being discharged from a Berlin hospital. The outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin emerged from a coma in early September after collapsing on a domestic flight in Siberia on Aug. 20. German doctors say he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Germany, France and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny's illness. The Kremlin has rejected any suggestion that Putin or the Russian authorities were responsible for Navalny's condition. Navalny said he did not know how a Novichok nerve agent had got into his system, but that he could have touched something. He said his recovery could take another two months. At one point in the interview he held out his hand to show it shaking. Navalny said he was undergoing physical therapy, but that his health had improved significantly and that doctors were surprised at the speed of his recovery. Russia's parliamentary elections are due to take place in September, although some media reports have suggested they could be brought forward to next spring. "
"NEW YORK: Beach umbrellas are back in garages as temperatures cool, but wealthy New Yorkers are staying in the Hamptons beyond summer, fearful of the pandemic and rising crime in the city. Robert Moore, a silver-haired digital entrepreneur, has been ensconced in his villa in Amagansett, a stone's throw from the beach, since March 13 when coronavirus began spreading across New York. But the 58-year-old has decided not to return to New York, his home of 26 years. He had planned to ""live a more nomadic life"" anyway but never envisaged leaving Manhattan. The pandemic changed that. ""If I have a choice, I don't have to be there so I'd rather not be,"" Moore told AFP. As New York became an early epicenter of America's outbreak earlier this year, the city's well-off flocked to the Long Island destination, which is just two hours by car from the Big Apple. ""When Covid hit in mid-March, the rental market blew up,"" recalled real estate agent James McLauchlen. ""It was just kind of a wild scene. People were bidding $80,000 for a summer rental that was available for $50,000. They just wanted to be out here,"" he added. McLauchlen says several homes have sold for $30 million or more, and demand is outstripping supply with prices rising 15 percent. The Hamptons, with its golden sandy beaches and quaint harbor towns, have long been a refuge for New York's elite, but normally just between June and the end of August. However, on a recent Wednesday in September, restaurants in Southampton were filling up at lunchtime, much to the delight of owners. ""There's definitely more people here at the end of September than there normally would be. I hope it continues,"" said Don Sullivan, owner of Southampton Publick House, a pub he opened 24 years ago. The British auction house Phillips has recently opened a branch in Southampton, as has the Hauser & Wirth gallery, as it chases the fortunes that have fled New York. Retirees, young professionals, families -- all age categories are represented as long as they have the means to live in this elite bubble where celebrities such as Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Lopez and Calvin Klein stay every summer. Ross School, a private school that charges more than $40,000 a year, welcomed 100 new students at the start of the new school year from nursery through fourth grade, compared to 16 last year, according to head of operations Andi O'Hearn. Our Lady of The Hamptons, a Catholic school, has 30 names on its waiting list and is ""still getting calls every day,"" said the principal, Sister Kathryn Schlueter. ""We took as many students as we could,"" she said. Orson Miller, a 24-year-old French student, has been staying with friends in the Hamptons while he finishes a Master's degree online from New York University. ""As long as nothing is resolved in New York and the situation is not certain, I think people will stay here,"" he told AFP. Natalie Simpson has been living in her Hamptons home since the spring and will be relocating to Connecticut rather than returning to New York. The 32-year-old mother says coronavirus is a factor, but that a recent crime spike was more concerning. Since the start of 2020, New York has seen a 40 percent increase of murders and a 42 percent uptick in burglaries. ""It's not really a place where we want to raise a child anymore, even though that was fully our plan,"" Simpson explained. With tennis, horseback riding, golf and sunsets on the beach, those in the Hamptons experienced a pandemic very different from people who remained in the Big Apple. Moore's eldest son, a recent graduate, chose to stay in Manhattan for work. ""I feel for my son, I feel for young kids, I feel for families that don't have the ability that we do,"" said Moore. ""We're very fortunate. There's a lot of people that don't have that luxury."" With New York's cultural life also at a standstill and restaurants operating with limitations, many fear New York has changed forever. ""It's never going to be the same and that's a little sad,"" said Moore. But not everybody is ready to give up on the city that -- until recently, anyway -- never slept. ""I'm missing New York and I'm kind of looking forward to spending a little more time there,"" said Lori Reinsberg, a 61-year-old art dealer who has been living in the Hamptons since late May. "
"BERLIN: The German government said Monday that laboratories in France and Sweden have confirmed its own findings that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement that Germany had asked France and Sweden ""for an independent review of the German evidence (of Novichok poisoning) on the basis of new samples from Mr Navalny,"" who is receiving treatment in Berlin. ""The results of this review at specialised laboratories in France and Sweden are now available and confirm the German evidence (of Novichok poisoning),"" Seibert said. He said Germany was still waiting for the outcome of a separate evaluation by the OPCW global chemical weapons watchdog. On the basis of the findings by the three European laboratories, however, Seibert said Germany was ""renewing its call for Russia to make a declaration on the events"" of the Navalny case. ""We are in close contact with our European partners about further steps,"" he added. The 44-year-old Kremlin critic and anti-corruption campaigner fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia last month and was hospitalised there before being flown to Berlin. Germany said two weeks ago there was ""unequivocal evidence"" that he was poisoned with Novichok but Russia has angrily dismissed the findings, saying its doctors found no trace of poison. Navalny has now emerged from a medically induced coma and is reacting to speech, Berlin's Charite hospital has said. The Kremlin has denounced attempts to blame the Russian state for the poisoning as ""absurd"" and said it wants to know what happened. Western politicians have said the incident appears likely to have been state-ordered and urged Moscow to prove its lack of involvement. Navalny's associates believe the use of Novichok shows only the Russian state could be responsible. The case has prompted international calls for Russia to carry out a transparent investigation or risk sanctions, but the country has not opened a criminal investigation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russia rejected ""when other countries dictate to us what legal procedures we should start and when"". He insisted Russia ""de facto"" is probing the incident, but cannot open a criminal case ""on the basis of tests by the German side, especially when carried out in German military labs."" Russian authorities want to question Navalny at his Berlin hospital, with Siberian transport police, who have been retracing Navalny's movements, saying Friday that Russia would be preparing a request for its officers and an ""expert"" to shadow German investigators.

"BERLIN: In a major diplomatic jolt to China, Germany has decided to focus on maintaining stronger partnerships with democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region in order to promote the rule of law. Berlin's drift towards the Indo-Pacific strategy comes as Europe has expressed concerns over China's track record on human rights and its economic dependence on the Asian country, Nikkei Asian Review reported. Indo-Pacific epicentre of 'great power competition' with China: Esper""We want to help shape (the future global order) so that it is based on rules and international cooperation, not on the law of the strong. That is why we have intensified cooperation with those countries that share our democratic and liberal values,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on September 2. That day, Germany adopted the new guidelines pertaining to the Indo-Pacific approach, stressing the importance of promoting the rule of law and open markets in the region. The Indo-Pacific strategy has been endorsed by other countries including India, Japan, Australia and ASEAN members. India, Japan agree to advance defence cooperation to realise free, open India-PacificAccording to Nikkei Asian Review, China had been Germany's diplomatic focal point in Asia, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel visiting the country almost yearly. It also must be noted that China also accounts for 50 per cent of Germany's trade with the Indo-Pacific region. However, as per expectations, economic growth has not opened the Chinese market. German companies operating in China have been forced to hand over technology by the Chinese government. Also, talks between the European Union (EU) and China regarding an investment treaty to resolve such issues have stalled, giving rise to concerns about Berlin's increasing economic dependence on Beijing. India, France, Australia hold first trilateral dialogue with focus on Indo-PacificThis came amid growing criticism of China's draconian national security law in Hong Kong and its concentration camps for the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, which has fuelled increasing resistance to Merkel's pro-China policies. Germany's new Indo-Pacific approach takes a tough stand on China, including criticism of the huge debt burden of countries participating in Beijing's Belt and Road initiative (BRI). US signs defence cooperation deal with Maldives amidst China's growing presence in Indian OceanGerman firms have also expressed concerns about doing business and protecting their intellectual property in China, especially after Chinese appliance maker Midea Group bought German robot maker Kuka in late 2016. Europe is appearing to re-evaluate its diplomatic relations with China. Last year, the EU termed China a ""strategic competitor"", focussing its trade and technological rivalry with Beijing. ""A shift toward a more sober strategy on Beijing has occurred,"" Patrick Koellner, at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, was quoted by Nikkei Asian Review as saying. Germany now plans to work with France regarding EU-wide strategy on Indo-Pacific. Berlin will be looking to strengthen its influence on this issue by having the bloc on its side. France and the United Kingdom have begun freezing Chinese telecom giant Huawei out of their 5G networks. Recently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had undertaken a five-nation official tour in Europe, but the visit did not gain traction and instead led to a growing rift between the two sides. "
"MUNICH: Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski scored four goals including a stoppage-time penalty to give the German champions a 4-3 home win over Hertha Berlin in a pulsating Bundesliga clash on Sunday. The result left Bayern fourth in the standings on six points from three games, one behind the top three led by Leipzig on goal difference, while Hertha slipped to 13th on four points. The sides had a goal each ruled out for offside before Lewandowski fired Bayern into a 40th-minute lead, drilling in a Serge Gnabry cross after goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow had saved his header. Bayern seemed to be in cruise control after Lewandowski made it 2-0 with a superb shot on the turn from the edge of the penalty area in the 51st, but the visitors had other ideas. Jhon Cordoba pulled one back with a towering header which Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer could not keep out and Matheus Cunha equalised after muscling his way past several defenders to steer a low shot into the bottom corner. That set up a frantic climax, with Lewandowski again taking centre stage and boosting his tally to 103 goals in 98 home games for Bayern at the Allianz Arena. ""In Bayern we have Robert Lewangoalski... You know? Robert LewanGOALski."" @esmuellert_ @lewy_officialâ¦ https://t.co/ezMAmKnV3F— FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen (@FCBayern) 1601834953000He popped up at the far post in the 85th minute to tap in a cross from the right but Bayern's joy was short-lived as substitute Jessic Ngankam levelled three minutes later with his first touch of the ball. The 20-year old Ngankam netted his first Bundesliga goal with a diving header after a cross from the left, only for Hertha to see what would have been a well-deserved draw slip from their grasp. Bayern and Lewandowski had the last laugh as the prolific Polish striker dispatched his spot-kick into the bottom left corner after he was hauled down by Maximilian Mittelstaedt. After the two-week international break, Bayern visit promoted Arminia Bielefeld while Hertha host Vfb Stuttgart on October 17. "
"BERLIN: The German government said Monday it is taking a 23% stake in CureVac, a German company working on a potential vaccine for the coronavirus, underlining its determination to keep key industries in the country. The state-owned KfW development bank will buy 300 million euros ($337 million) in CureVac shares, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, adding that the aim is to give CureVac ``financial security.'' He said the government won't exert influence on CureVac's business decisions. The main shareholder in CureVac is Dietmar Hopp, the co-founder of German-based business software company SAP. ``For me and for the whole German government, it is ... absolutely elementary that we preserve and strengthen promising key industries in Germany, be they digital, artificial intelligence industries; electric batteries; the chemical industry, the steel industry and many others,'' Altmaier said. ``That goes in particular for biotechnology and life sciences.'' In March, Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff, Helge Braun, said that German officials had had ``very intensive contact'' with CureVac and that there had been ``thoughts of enticing it to the United States.'' He didn't elaborate on the nature of the U.S. interest. CureVac and the then-U.S. ambassador to Germany rejected a newspaper report at the time that President Donald Trump apparently had offered the German firm a large amount to secure its work for the U.S. Altmaier acknowledged that ``the development of vaccines _ and medical products in general _ can come with risks and the possibility of failure.'' ``But we must examine every opportunity, and we must give innovative companies the opportunity to prove themselves,'' he added. ``And I am convinced that CureVac deserves such a chance.'' The announcement that the government will acquire a stake in CureVac comes only two days after drugmaker AstraZeneca struck a deal with a vaccine alliance formed by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands to supply up to 400 million doses of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine. All other European Union member states will have the chance to take part. Other companies, including Moderna and Sanofi, are racing to develop and produce a vaccine to protect against the new coronavirus, a step experts say will be crucial to allowing countries to ease public health lockdowns and restrictions on public life.

"BHOPAL: In the midst of Covid-19 when most of the things have seen a downturn, it was heartening to see the first ever train from Bhopal railway division leave for Bangladesh on Friday, with 100 tractors on board. The maiden train was flagged-off from Mandideep railway station. The Union railway minister Piyush Goyal also tweeted and congratulated the officials for scripting history. DRM Uday Borwanker said, âBhopal Division railway administration has been making continuous efforts to promote freight traffic through railway. For this, we are contacting merchants related to goods transportation, by giving information about various incentive schemes. They are being motivated to transport more and more goods through railâ . Borwanker said that 100 tractors were loaded into 25 AMG (coaches) and sent to Benapole (Bangladesh) from Mandideep station.âThis gave the Railways a revenue of Rs18.23 lakh. This is the first time in the history of Bhopal division that tractor transport is being done by a freight train to another country,â he said. He invited traders to avail the benefits given by Bhopal division. "
"NEW DELHI: Tesla Inc has agreed to acquire German ATW Automation, a supplier assembling battery modules and packs for the auto industry, a source familiar with the transaction said on Friday. ATW, a subsidiary of Canadian ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc, was on the brink of liquidation due to a slump in orders, German media reported in September. ATS on Sept. 25 announced that certain assets and employees at one of its Germany-based units would be sold and transferred to a third party, without disclosing the name of the company. ATS and ATW on Friday did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ATW, based in western Germany, has about 120 employees and has completed more than 20 battery production lines for international automakers, according to ATS' website. Tesla plans to ramp up battery production significantly in the coming years and during a recent event presented innovations that it said would sharply reduce the cost of battery packs within the next three years. The company is currently building its third vehicle manufacturing facility near Berlin, which will also include a battery plant, and aims to start construction on a new vehicle factory in Texas this year. Tesla's planned future lineup includes the light duty Cybertruck and the Semi truck, which require higher battery capacities. Tesla on Friday said it had delivered a record 139,300 vehicles globally in the third quarter. The company aims to deliver half a million vehicles by the end of this year. "
"NEW DELHI: Germany has mounted a massive exercise to fly out its citizens from India. Tuesday onwards Air India will operate nine charter flights from cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai to Frankfurt on its wide body aircraft to fly Germans back home over next few days. These aircraft will fly back as ferry flights â meaning with no passengers â while returning from Germany to Delhi. Last week, Lufthansa had operated two special flights from Delhi, using its double decker 500-seater Airbus A380, to fly Germans back home. Air India has operated large number of special flights to fly back Indians stranded in corona hotspots like China, Japan and Europe. Thousands have flown back home on these flights. There is huge demand for similar charters by AI from other countries too like US, UK and Canada to fly back their citizens from India. âThe situation is very fluid. Discussions are on but as of now no decision has been taken,â said sources. German Ambassador to India, Walter J Lindner, tweeted on Monday: âAfter flying 1,000 stranded travellers from Delhi to Frankfurt last week, we are working closely with Indian authorities (especially ministry of external affairs) to bring home many more. Challenges amidst lock-down not small, but weâre working on it 24/7â¦ We continue to do everything humanly possible to bring the stranded travellers still remaining in India back to Germany.â After flying 1000 stranded travellers from Delhi to Frankfurt last week, weâre working closely w/t IND authoritiesâ¦ https://t.co/kyhvIXNibz— Walter J.

Canada, for instance, wanted to fly out its citizens from India. But AI can operate only quick turnaround flights on which the entire operating crew gets back home on the return flight. Sources say Canada was informed the possibility of flying its citizens from India to somewhere in Europe, from where it makes arrangements to fly them home, can be discussed. AI has operated special flights to China, Europe and Israel by taking two sets of crew so that one set operates on the way out and the other while flying back home. At this point when schedule commercial flights are suspended to India till April 15 and in many other countries also for varying periods of time, AI wants to have its crew back on the same flight to avoid leaving them stranded in foreign lands. âWe have to be fully ready with our fleeting personnel to operate special flights to fly out foreigners or fly back Indians from across the world whenever the government asks us to do so. So no chance is being taken,â said a source. "
"MUNICH (Germany): Bayern Munich claimed their fifth title of the year on Wednesday as a late Joshua Kimmich goal sealed their 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund to land the German Super Cup. Hosts Bayern built a 2-0 lead with first-half goals by Corentin Tolisso and Thomas Mueller, only for Erling Braut Haaland to equalise early in the second half after Julian Brandt pulled a Dortmund goal back just before the break. However, Kimmich settled the matter through sheer determination behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena. His initial shot was saved by Dortmund goalkeeper Marwin Hitz but the rebound clipped Kimmich's boot and looped in for the winning goal eight minutes from time. ""Joshua is a classy player. The way he chipped that ball in,"" said Bayern captain Manuel Neuer in admiration. â½ Bayern 3-2 Dortmund ð¹ in 60 seconds #Supercup2020 #FCBBVB https://t.co/JaGPktuI0w— Bundesliga English (@Bundesliga_EN) 1601499916000Having had their record 23-match winning streak ended by a shock defeat at Hoffenheim on Sunday, Bayern bounced back with Kimmich leading the charge. ""As long as I have known him (Kimmich), his mentality is very special. He is well on his way to being one of those players who shape this club,"" Bayern head coach Hansi Flick told broadcaster ZDF. Bayern have already won an eighth-straight Bundesliga title, the German Cup, Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup this year. This is the fourth time in five years they have won the showcase match. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki and England winger Jadon Sancho missed the flight to Munich with ""a respiratory infection"", the club said, but both tested negative on Monday for Covid-19. ðï¸ð https://t.co/XzPuutvRYF— FC Bayern English (@FCBayernEN) 1601500860000Flick made five changes from the side which lost 4-1 at Hoffenheim. Leroy Sane was sidelined by a knee injury, Leon Goretzka rested and Segre Gnabry started on the bench. Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies moved up to the wing and Tolisso started in central midfield. The Frenchman gave Bayern the lead when Robert Lewandowski put in a short cross from the right wing and Tolisso side-footed home on 18 minutes. Mueller grabbed Bayern's second when he headed home after Davies floated in a cross on 32 minutes. Brandt put Dortmund back in the game five minutes before the break when Benjamin Pavard's loose pass was snapped up by Marco Reus and Brandt finished the move. It was 2-1 at the break, but Dortmund defender Thomas Meunier fired a golden chance over the bar early in the second half with just Manuel Neuer to beat. ððððððððð Bundesliga ðððððð DFB Pokalðððððð DFL Supercup ðð Champions Leagueðð Super Cup ð World Cup ð Club Wâ¦ https://t.co/M9jQBzBvbo— ðºð¸ FC Bayern US ð¨ð¦ (@FCBayernUS) 1601499900000Dortmund drew level when central midfielder Thomas Delaney slid a great pass into Haaland, who showed ice cool finishing to fire past Neuer on 55 minutes.

The pair exchanged passes and although Hitz saved the inital shot, the rebound looped over his head into the Dortmund goal after clipping Kimmich's boot. The Super Cup was the final game for Bundesliga referee Bibiana Steinhaus, 41, the first female to officiate in one of Europe's top leagues, before retirement. "
"FRANKFURT: Thomas Schaefer, the finance minister of Germany's Hesse state, has committed suicide apparently after becoming ""deeply worried"" over how to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus, state premier Volker Bouffier said Sunday. Schaefer, 54, was found dead near a railway track on Saturday. The Wiesbaden prosecution's office said they believe he died by suicide. ""We are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,"" Bouffier said in a recorded statement. Hesse is home to Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, where major lenders like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have their headquarters. The European Central Bank is also located in Frankfurt. A visibly shaken Bouffier recalled that Schaefer, who was Hesse's finance chief for 10 years, had been working ""day and night"" to help companies and workers deal with the economic impact of the pandemic. ""Today we have to assume that he was deeply worried,"" said Bouffier, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""It's precisely during this difficult time that we would have needed someone like him,"" he added. Popular and well-respected, Schaefer had long been touted as a possible successor to Bouffier. Like Bouffier, Schaefer belonged to Merkel's centre-right CDU party. He leaves behind a wife and two children. "
"Chennai: The sudden cancellation of Lufthansa flights, after the directorate general of civil aviation refused permission for the airlines to operate its schedules in October agreed under âair bubbleâ, has hit several travellers from the city. Students joining universities and those returning to work are among those affected. As most of the universities reopen mid-October in Europe, students who had booked tickets for travel next week onwards have now been forced to shell out more to rebook their flight, repay quarantine fees and other expenses. There is no certainty if there will be enough options to fly out as fewer services are available. âLufthansa had allowed 50kg baggage for students. Many preferred the airline because of easy onward connections from Frankfurt,â an airport official said. While Air France can an option, the airline will start flights only on October 26 from Chennai by when it may be too late for many. Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels said, âRebooking and finding convenient schedules are not easy. Students had booked to travel to Ireland, Germany and France. A few were also scheduled to travel to Lithuania via Frankfurt. Most of them wanted to fly before October 10, in time for colleges reopening from October 12 to 15. People who wanted to travel for jobs are also stuck.â âSuspending the schedule after finalizing them creates further confusion as Air India cannot serve all the destinations either,â he added. Lufthansa was in good demand and people spent Rs 40,000 to Rs 55,000 on the tickets, said Basheer Ahmed of Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI). âSome of the students had also taken pre-travel Covid-19 tests too. The airline will issue refunds but rescheduling the travel will be a hassle for students. They will not get the same baggage allowance with other airlines and will end up paying extra for excess baggage.â This has caused anxiety among parents and travellers, added Balan. The uncertainty triggered by the decision has affected the travellers who now hesitate to make advance booking, said Ahmed. About the move, DGCA has said, âthere are restrictions on Indians desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage, resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa. As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. Despite this disparity, we offered to clear seven flights a week for Lufthansa, which they did not accept.â Nevertheless, irate passengers took to social media to criticize the DGCA for the sudden turn of events.

"BERLIN: Germany is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August. The government agreed Wednesday to extend the guidance introduced on March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic to almost all non-EU countries, with the exception of some that have successfully contained the outbreak. Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain. "
"BERLIN: German chancellor Angela Merkel praised women in Belarus for staging peaceful protests in the wake of the country's disputed presidential election and said on Wednesday that she plans to meet soon with the main opposition candidate. Merkel's comments came a day after French President Emmanuel Macron met with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in Lithuania. Tsikhanouskaya went into exile after the August 9 election that Belarus officials claimed President Alexander Lukashenko won with 80% of the vote to her 10%. Opposition activists and some poll workers say the results that gave Lukashenko a sixth term were fraudulent. Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions on the President, his son and six government officials over a crackdown during weeks of post-election protests in Belarus. The European Union is considering whether to impose sanctions as well. Germany currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. ""We don't recognize the election of President Lukashenko,"" Merkel told German lawmakers, reiterating her condemnation of the violent crackdown on political opponents in Belarus. ""I will meet soon with the opposition activist Tsikhanouskaya,"" she said, adding, ""When you see the bravery of women that's on display in the streets there, for freedom and a life without corruption, then I can only say, I admire that and I find it really impressive."" Merkel, who has been Germany's chancellor for 15 years, joined the newly emboldened opposition movement in East Germany shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, declined to say whether a date and place for the meeting with Tsikhanouskaya had been set. Asked about Britain and Canada's decision to impose sanctions on Lukashenko, Seibert said Germany has ""firmly resolved"" that the European Union should also agree on sanctions against Belarus. ""We regret that this hasn't been possible yet,"" he told reporters in Berlin. ""But it remains our goal that such restrictive measures are taken."" ""To do this we continue to have intensive exchanges with our European partners,"" Seibert said. ""The goal is therefore comparable to that of Britain, for example."" "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is constantly reassessing the best posture for the American military forces and its presence overseas, the White House has said, while clarifying that there is no announcement to make on the withdrawal of US troops in Germany. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany made the comments at a press conference on Monday while responding to media reports that Trump has decided to withdraw thousands of US troops from Germany, a NATO ally. âWe have no announcements at this time. I know there's reporting out there, but, as of this moment, there are no announcements. âThe President is continually reassessing the best posture for the United States Military forces and our presence overseas. I mean, we remain committed to working with our strong allies,â McEnany said. Currently there are about 34,500 US troops stationed in Germany. According to The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, the reported troop reduction plan of Trump would cap US soldiers in Germany to 25,000. A senior US official said the administration has been discussing the move since September and that it is not linked to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision not to attend a G-7 meeting Trump was to host in Washington in the end of June, according to The Wall Street Journal. Officials on Friday said that the Trump administration ordered the change in a memorandum signed recently by White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. The Washington Post had reported that Germany was not informed about the decision as of Friday. The reduction plan, it said, was pushed by US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who has also served for the past several months as acting director of national intelligence. Congressman Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described the decision as reckless. ""Vladimir Putin (Russian president) must be delighted that the American president is gutting our own deterrent against Russian aggression in Europe,"" he said in a statement. ""And the president's (Trump) insulting dismissal of one of our most important relationships because of a personal vendetta confirms that he lacks moral leadership, respect for our allies and understanding of our national security interests,â Engel said. Meanwhile, AP reported from Berlin on Saturday that German lawmaker Norbert Roettgen has criticised the reported US troops withdrawal plan, terming it as ""very regrettable."" In an interview published Saturday by Germany's Funke Media Group, lawmaker Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Union bloc who chairs the German parliament's foreign policy committee, was quoted as saying that he couldn't see âany factual reason for the withdrawal"" and that US soldiers were welcome in Germany.

"MUNICH: A German sports doctor on trial for masterminding an international doping network for athletes admitted on Tuesday to helping athletes with blood doping for years but said he made no profit. The defendant, identified in Germany only as Mark S., is on trial, facing multiple charges in relation to helping at least 23 athletes from eight countries gain an unfair advantage over several years. ""I did not make a profit from doping,"" he said in a statement read by his lawyers in court. The defendant also said he never put the athletes' health at risk but did admit to blood doping. ""For me it was always important that there was no damage to the athletes' health."" The case is a result of ""Operation Bloodletting"" under which police raided the Nordic Ski World Championships in Austria in February 2019 and arrested athletes just hours before the start of an event. Mark S. was arrested in Germany. Prosecutors say he was behind performance-enhancing blood transfusions mostly for cross-country skiers and cyclists. They believe he was involved in the practice from at least the end of 2011. Four other suspects are on trial accused of helping him with the collection and supply of blood. If convicted, the doctor could be put behind bars for between one and 10 years. The trial is set to continue until at least mid-December. The trial that started earlier in September continues and a verdict is expected in the coming months. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has decided to withdraw thousands of US troops from Germany, multiple media reports said. There has been American presence in the European nation from the post-World War II era and currently, about 34,500 US troops are stationed there.

""And the president's (Trump) insulting dismissal of one of our most important relationships because of a personal vendetta confirms that he lacks moral leadership, respect for our allies, and understanding of our national security interests,â Engel said. But it is legitimately shocking that Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Joint Chiefs chair General Mark Milley, and others are staying silent as the president pushes through this reckless decision without input from senior officials or experts, he said. In response, I will be working with my colleagues in the Congress, on both sides of the aisle, to see what can be done to reverse the decision, Engel said. The Pentagon and the White House's National Security Council was not immediately available for comment. âWe always knew Trump would lash out when he is under pressure domestically, but we thought he would first pull out of Afghanistan,â an unnamed official was quoted as saying by The Wall Street Journal. âThis move will not help friends of the US in Germany who are working hard to preserve the trans-Atlantic relationship, but it will boost the anti-American sentiment that has been spreading here,â the official said. The Washington Post reported that Germany was not informed about the decision as of Friday. The reduction plan, it said, was pushed by US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who has also served for the past several months as acting director of national intelligence. âIt's another favour to Putin and another leadership failure by this administration that further strains relations with our allies,â said Senator Jack Reed, ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. He called the decision as petty and preposterous. "
"BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz has left the German national team hotel because of a ""looming transfer"" to the Premier League, the German Football Association said on Friday. The talented 21-year-old attacking midfielder, who is close to signing for Chelsea for a fee reported by British and German media to be more than 80 million euros ($95 million), did not feature in Germany's 1-1 Nations League draw against Spain on Thursday. ""Kai Havertz on Friday left the accommodation of the German national team in Stuttgart. The reason for his departure is the looming transfer to England,"" the German FA said. Havertz scored 12 league goals for Leverkusen last season and set up another six. Germany play Switzerland in their next game on Sunday. "
"NEW DELHI: More than 5 million people have been infected with coronavirus but the healthcare system of India has shown great efficiency in providing diagnostic and management facilities as well as keeping the mortality at âminimum' and recovery at âmaximum', Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Friday. He was speaking at an event to mark the 65th Foundation Day of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. He said the country's continuously rising Covid-19 recovery rate and progressively falling case fatality rate have proven the success of the containment strategy followed by all states/UTs, the health ministry said in a statement. ""We have successfully ramped up our testing capacity which has touched nearly 15 lakh milestone today with more than 1,800 testing labs spread across the country. ""I have confidence in the scientific developments taking place in the field of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19 and soon India will achieve more success in our fight against coronavirus infection,"" the statement quoted Vardhan as saying.

He also hailed the institution's huge contribution during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""More than 5 million patients have been infected with coronavirus but the healthcare system of India has shown great efficiency in not only providing diagnostic and management facilities but also keeping the mortality at minimum and recovery at maximum. âI appreciate that in the last six months, AIIMS has taken a huge responsibility of providing care to patients suffering from COVID-19, for innovating in areas of research, guiding colleagues across the country and developing new methods of teaching and communication,â the statement said. Speaking at the event, minister of state for health Ashwini Kumar Choubey praised the medical community for their endless and selfless efforts during Covid times. ""AIIMS has established high reputation and has contributed significantly in academic, research and patient care.

"STUTTGART (Germany): Germany's players have very different fitness levels ahead of their Nations League opener against Spain on Thursday and will struggle to last 90 minutes due to the fragmented end to the previous season across Europe, coach Joachim Loew said. The Germans return to international action almost 10 months since their last match as the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the global sports calendar. ""The situation that we have here is that there are a lot of differences between players,"" Loew told a news conference. ""Some have been training for some weeks but have no match practice. Others just finished playing in the Champions League and the Europa League. ""Others are just back from holidays that were short. I don't think players will last over 90 minutes at a high pace."" Germany, who also play Switzerland in the Nations League on September 6, are looking ahead to next year's European championship and Loew said it would take longer than usual to have a fine-tuned tournament team ready. ""The overriding goal is next year's tournament. This year we will not be playing with an identical team any time soon,"" Loew said. Germany will be largely deprived of players from Champions League winners Bayern Munich and semi-finalists RB Leipzig. All Bayern and Leipzig players have been rested for the two games, with the exception of Bayern's Niklas Suele, who only returned from a lengthy injury break at the end of the season, and Leroy Sane, who joined the German champions from Manchester City in the close season. Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Germany's second-choice keeper, has also been rested. ""We will not be able to start fine-tuning the team before next March, the final pre-tournament friendlies and the training camp,"" Loew said. ""What is important is to overcome this difficult and busy season and arrive fresh at the tournament next year."" ""We saw at the Champions League tournament how important that freshness was,"" Loew said. "
"LONDON: England's women will face twice world champions Germany in a friendly on Oct. 27 as they return to action for the first time in over seven months, the Football Association said on Monday. The Lionesses last played at the SheBelieves Cup in March where defeats by hosts United States and Spain condemned them to a third-place finish in the four-team tournament. England lost 2-1 to Germany in a friendly last year at Wembley Stadium in front of a record crowd of over 77,000. October's clash at the Brita-Arena in Wiesbaden will take place behind closed doors due to COVID-19 restrictions.

"MOSCOW: The Kremlin on Tuesday said that Russian efforts to look into the case of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who Germany says was poisoned, were encountering problems because his allies had removed evidence from the country. Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was airlifted to Germany last month after collapsing on a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk to Moscow. Germany has concluded he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Russia says it has seen no evidence of poisoning. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still facing difficulties in obtaining information from Germany. "
"MOSCOW: Russian pharmaceutical company Petrovax launched phase 3 clinical trials of the Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidate, CanSino Biologics Ad5-nCoV, on the first group of Russian volunteers in Moscow, the company said on Monday. The Russian company first shared with Sputnik its plans to carry out late-stage clinical trials of the Chinese vaccine candidate, Ad5-nCoV, in mid-August. ""Petrovax, CanSino Biologics Inc. and the contract research organization OCT Clinical have launched vaccinations of the first volunteers in Moscow treatment centers,"" the company said in a statement obtained by Sputnik. According to the company, the first volunteers are doing well. ""None of them showed any undesirable effects. According to clinical regulations, study participants will be under direct supervision during the first 28 days after vaccination and will have to undergo four interim face-to-face examinations,"" Petrovax underlined. According to the company's forecast, during this period, the vaccinated participants will develop a humoral and cellular immune response to Covid-19. Petrovax said it would continue to recruit volunteers. Over 3,000 applications were received so far. Once the Chinese vaccine is registered in Russia, Petrovax will be able to produce it at its facilities in the Moscow Region. The firm plans to market the vaccine domestically and within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). More than 4 million doses of the vaccine per month are expected to be produced in 2020. Starting in 2021, the production volume could be increased to 10 million doses per month. Ad5-nCOV was the first vaccine to undergo clinical trials on humans in China back in March and phases 1 and 2 were conducted domestically. According to the Global Times, the vaccine's phase 3 clinical trials are expected to include some 40,000 volunteers. Pakistan, Mexico and Saudi Arabia are also reportedly in talks with China's CanSino Biologics on hosting the vaccine clinical trials. "
"WASHINGTON: The US on Monday will sanction over two dozen people and entities involved in Iranâs nuclear, missile and conventional arms programmes, a US official said, putting teeth behind UN sanctions on Tehran that Washington argues have resumed despite the opposition of allies and adversaries. The official said Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with nuclear-armed North Korea. He did not provide detailed evidence regarding either assertion. The new curbs put European allies, China and Russia on notice that while their inclination may be to ignore the US drive to maintain the UN sanctions on Iran, firms based in their nations would feel the bite for violating them. The Trump administration had reimposed UN sanctions against Iran on Saturday over the strenuous objections of its closest allies. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced the âreturn of virtually all previously terminated UN curbsâ and, in effect, declared a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran as no longer in force. Iranâs President Hassan Rouhani said a concerted campaign by Washington to pressure Tehran had backfired. âWe can say that Americaâs âmaximum pressureâ against Iran, in its political and legal aspect, has turned into Americaâs maximum isolation.â On Friday, Britain, France and Germany had said in a letter the curbs would have no legal effect. The letter said all three would work to preserve the 2015 deal. "
"BERLIN: Germany's foreign ministry called in the Russian ambassador in Berlin on Thursday to complain ""in the strongest possible terms"" about a hack attack on the German lower house of parliament in 2015 and discuss possible sanctions against those responsible. Russia has rejected allegations that its military intelligence was behind the cyber attack after media reported that data had been stolen, including emails from Chancellor Angela Merkel's constituency office. State Secretary Miguel Berger told the ambassador that the government would call for the EU's cyber sanctions mechanism to be invoked against those responsible for the attack, said the German ministry in a statement. The EU last year approved a system to freeze hackers' assets in the bloc and banning them from entry. Federal prosecutors issued an arrest warrant on May 5 for Russian national Dmitry Badin over the attack and the German ministry said there was credible evidence that he was part of the GRU military intelligence service at the time of the attack. ""The arrest warrant against Mr Badin was issued on the basis of the strong suspicion that the accused conspired with other hitherto anonymous persons to carry out intelligence activities against Germany on behalf of the secret service of a foreign power,"" said the ministry. In a statement on Wednesday, the Russian embassy in Berlin said German officials so far had not been able to present facts to underpin the accusations against Moscow. The German ministry also said its assessment was affected by an ongoing investigation into the murder of a Russian-Georgian man, a former Chechen rebel, in Berlin last summer which led to an exchange of diplomatic expulsions. ""The government... expressly reserves the right to take further measures,"" said the foreign ministry. "
"Jalandhar: In the third case of its kind in Germany, a 54-year-old Indian Sikh is being tried in a Frankfurt court for allegedly spying on Sikhs and Kashmiris for external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). News agency AFP reported that the Frankfurt court started the trial of Balvir Singh on Tuesday. Balvir has been accused of spying on the expatriate communities for RAW since January 2015. He has been accused of providing information about figures in the Sikh opposition scene, the Kashmiri movement and their relatives in Germany to his handlers, apparently working at the Indian consulate general in Frankfurt.  âA total of 10 hearings before the regional superior court are scheduled, with the trial due to conclude on October 29,â the report said. The same Frankfurt court had convicted an Indian couple of spying in December last year. âThe husband was handed a suspended prison sentence of 18 months for acting as a foreign intelligence agent and his wife fined 180 days' wages for aiding him,â AFP reported. In this case of spying by the Sikh couple, federal prosecutors in Germany had said that Manmohan Singh, 51, had been providing information to RAW from January 2015 onward and in July 2017, his wife Kanwaljit Kaur, 51, also started working for the agency. They were accused of receiving Euros 7,200 from RAW for the information they provided to their handler, who was stationed in Germany. In 2014, a Sikh man was convicted and sentenced to nine-month jail by a German court for spying on Sikhs there. It was found that Manmohan Singh worked as a journalist for a Sikh channel in Germany. Before that, he allegedly had proximity with Sikh radicals. After the coupleâs indictment in April, Mamohanâs photographs with a few prominent political leaders of Punjab were also circulated on social media. "
"BERLIN: Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland scored twice and teenager Giovanni Reyna added another goal as they cruised past Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 in their season opener on Saturday. The 20-year-old Haaland scored a 54th-minute penalty, awarded for a foul on Reyna, and bagged another with a sensationally quick counter-attack and a Jadon Sancho assist as Dortmund utilised their fearsome youthful attacking weapons. Norway forward Haaland, who joined in January, took his tally to 15 goals in his 16 Bundesliga games so far this year. A day after Bayern Munich opened their season with an 8-0 demolition of Schalke 04, Dortmund sent a warning to the title holders with their dominant performance over Gladbach, who will be competing in the Champions League this season. Reyna opened the scoring in the 35th minute after combining perfectly with fellow 17-year-old Jude Bellingham, making his league debut after joining from Birmingham City.

Gladbach had a good early chance through Jonas Hofmann but struggled throughout with Dortmund's speed, and not even the introduction of strikers Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram could turn things around. The hosts, playing in front of a crowd limited to 9,300 fans in their 80,000-capacity stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions, also hit the crossbar with a Sancho header. "
"Bayern Munich delivered a message to the rest of the Bundesliga that the treble winners are in superb form, coach Hansi Flick said on Friday following an 8-0 demolition of Schalke 04 in their season opener. Bayern started their league campaign with a bang as they scored three times by the 31st minute to kill off the game with their stunning pace and deadly finishing. ""It was superb from us. Before the game we wanted this to be a game that would define where we are at this stage and my players did it very well,"" Flick said. ""We wanted to show that in this season again we are here."" Yet Flick was quick to point out that it was just one game in a long and crowded season to come. Whirlwind Bayern Munich dismantle Schalke 8-0 in season opener""We just had the first game. Let us go slowly here. But it was important to show we are on the right path."" It was a record win for an opening Bundesliga game and came less than a month after Bayern clinched the Champions League title to complete the treble. They have won the last eight German league titles in a row. ""Bayern were in sensationally good form,"" said Schalke coach David Wagner, whose team has failed to win any of their last 17 league matches. ""At the moment Bayern are most likely the world's strongest team. They showed that today. ""We did not play well at all. We now need to shake it off and show a reaction (next week)."" "
"MUNICH (Germany): Treble winners Bayern Munich crushed Schalke 8-0 with a hat-trick from Serge Gnabry and a superb debut from Leroy Sane on Friday as they made a sensational start to the new Bundesliga season and sent an ominous warning to potential challengers. With the biggest opening win in Bundesliga history, Bayern showed they had lost none of sharpness that helped them to lift the Champions League trophy less than a month ago in dominant fashion. Gnabry grabbed his first goal for the hosts with a fine turn and shot in the fourth minute in what turned out to be a one-sided affair that stretched Bayern's unbeaten run to 31 games this year, having now won the last 22 matches in a row. Schalke, without a league win in 17 consecutive matches since January, were helpless against Bayern's lightning-quick game and Leon Goretzka found plenty of space to drive a low shot past keeper Ralf Faehrmann in the 19th minute.

""The team is still hungry despite winning the treble last season and to have such a start is outstanding."" Bayern finished their season in August when they added the Champions League to their Bundesliga and German Cup titles and then had only a short preparation for the new season. Last season's top scorer Robert Lewandowski found the net with a 31st-minute penalty to become the first player to score in 10 successive appearances against the same Bundesliga opponents. Gnabry then scored twice from Sane's assists in the 47th and 59th before Thomas Mueller made it half a dozen after Lewandowski set him up with an impressive rabona kick.

A little later substitute Jamal Musiala drilled in goal number eight to become the youngest ever Bayern scorer in the league at 17 years old. The result piled more pressure on already-embattled Schalke coach David Wagner, who has been under intense scrutiny during their winless run this year. "
"CANACONA: A German national was found dead on Wednesday night in her apartment at Chaudi in Canacona.

"BERLIN: Urban farming startup Infarm said on Thursday that it had raised $170 million from investors that it will plough into expanding its network under cultivation in Europe, North America and Asia by 10 times over the next five years. Berlin-based Infarm is a proponent of indoor 'farming as a service', which uses cloud-computing to managed the cultivation of produce that is grown close to consumers, minimising its environmental impact. ""This investment will help us make a truly global impact ... and ultimately change the way people grow, eat and think about food,"" said Erez Galonska, Infarm's co-founder and CEO of the seven-year-old business. Infarm said its Series C investment round was led by LGT Lightstone and should reach $200 million by the time it closes. It brings total funding raised so far to $300 million. Other investors in the first round included Hanaco, Bonnier, Haniel, and Latitude, along with existing backers Atomico, TriplePoint Capital, Mons Capital and Good Harvest. Infarm has struck a total of $400 million in supply deals with major food retailers including Germany's Aldi Sued, Marks and Spencer in Britain and Kroger in the United States. It plans to expand its area under cultivation to 5 million square feet (465,000 square metres) by 2025, up from the 500,000 square feet it now runs in 10 countries, and add mushrooms, tomatoes and strawberries to the salad and herbs it now sells.

"BERLIN: Germany will kick off its Nations League matches in September without most of its Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig internationals, who finished their season only days ago with the Champions League tournament. National coach Joachim Loew on Tuesday said the disrupted season, which ended with Sunday's Champions League final that Bayern won, meant there would be changes in the squad for games against Spain on Sept. 3 and Switzerland three days later. Germany will be without Bayern's treble winners Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka, Manuel Neuer and Serge Gnabry and Leipzig's Lukas Klostermann and Marcel Halstenberg. ""As a national team coach I have a responsibility to the players,"" Loew told a news conference. ""What is important is that clubs and federations work closer together than ever in order to control the strain on the players."" He will however have Bayern central defender Niklas Suele, recently back following a cruciate ligament tear last year, and Paris St Germain's Julian Draxler and Thilo Kehrer. ""They had a longer break in France and have played fewer matches than the Bayern or Leipzig players,"" Loew said. Loew also called up three newcomers with Atalanta leftback Robin Gosens, Borussia Moenchengladbach midfielder Florian Neuhaus and Hoffenheim keeper Oliver Baumann in his 22-man squad. Germany also play Ukraine as part of their League A Group 4 matches. "
"BERLIN: The German government plans to generate up to 11 billion euros ($13 billion) for clean transportation and renewable energy projects this year by issuing so-called green bond, officials said on Monday.  The step is part of an effort to meet demand for environmentally friendly investments and follows the path already taken by other countries, including neighbouring France.  Each green bond will mirror a regular debt issuance by the German government, known as ""bunds"", which are considered safe havens for investors.  Germany's deputy finance minister, Joerg Kukies, said the first green bonds worth 4 billion euros will be issued next month, with the rest released in the fourth quarter.  The government has identified spending of over 12.7 billion euros that would meet the criteria of green investment, Kukies said.  Germany's state-owned KfW bank and several municipalities have already issued their own green bonds. "
"FRANKFURT: Germany's motor vehicle authority KBA is investigating Porsche AG over the suspected manipulation of petrol engines to achieve improved emissions data. A KBA spokesman said on Monday the investigation involved petrol engines that Porsche, Volkswagen's luxury sports vehicle unit, produced for the European market before 2017. Porsche had confirmed a newspaper report on Sunday that it had informed the authorities after internal investigations uncovered suspected irregularities. German prosecutors fined Porsche 535 million euros ($632 million) last year for lapses that allowed the company to cheat diesel emissions tests, but manipulation has not yet been proven for petrol engines. A Porsche spokesman on Sunday said the issues relate to vehicles developed several years ago, adding there were no indications that current production was affected. The carmaker is working closely with authorities, he added. Bild am Sonntag weekly had reported that the investigation was focused on engines developed between 2008 and 2013, including those of the Panamera and 911 models, with suspected illegal changes to hardware and software that could affect exhaust systems and engine components. The paper also said that apart from discussions with employees, evidence was also being sought in the minutes of company meetings and hundreds of thousands of emails. "
"MOSCOW: Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny shared a photograph from a Berlin hospital on Tuesday, sitting up in bed and surrounded by his family, and said he could now breathe independently after being poisoned in Siberia last month. The photo - the strongest evidence yet of Navalny's advancing recovery after emerging from a coma last week - was swiftly followed by confirmation from his press spokeswoman that he planned to return to Russia. ""Hi, this is Navalny. I miss you all,"" he wrote in the caption to his Instagram followers. ""I can still hardly do anything, but yesterday I could breathe all day on my own. Actually on my own."" The leading opponent of President Vladimir Putin, fell violently sick while campaigning on Aug. 20 and was airlifted to Berlin. Germany says laboratory tests in three countries have determined he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent, and Western governments have demanded an explanation from Russia. Moscow has called the accusations groundless. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated on Tuesday that Moscow was open to clearing up what happened to Navalny, but needed access to information on his case from Berlin. He said Moscow did not understand why, if French and Swedish laboratories had been able to test his medical samples, Russia was not being given the same access. The case has further strained relations between Russia and the West, already at a post-Cold War low since Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the attempted poisoning of a former Russian double agent with the same Novichok nerve agent in England in 2018. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has faced calls to punish Russia by suspending work on Nord Stream 2, a nearly completed pipeline bringing gas from Russia to Germany. 'NO OTHER OPTIONS' The photograph showed Navalny looking towards the camera, with his wife Yulia supporting him with her arms and their two children looking on. The New York Times on Tuesday quoted a German security official as saying Navalny had spoken to a German prosecutor about the incident and said he planned to return to Russia as soon as he recovered. Confirming the report, Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter: ""No other options were ever considered."" Asked for comment, Peskov said: ""Any citizen of the Russian Federation is free to leave Russia and return to Russia. If a citizen of the Russian Federation recovers his health, then of course everyone will be happy about that."" The Kremlin has for years regarded Navalny with contempt. In a rare departure from his normal practice of referring to ""the Berlin patient"", Peskov spoke the opposition leader's name on Tuesday. Navalny, 44, has not been allowed to form a political party but has riled Putin for the past decade with detailed campaigns exposing official corruption, bypassing the state-controlled media by using Instagram and YouTube. In his social media post, he even attempted a flash of humour, saying that breathing naturally was ""an amazing process, underestimated by many. I'd recommend it."" "
"COPENHAGEN: Europe will face a rising death toll from the coronavirus during the autumn months, the World Health Organization warned on Monday, as the number of daily infections around the world reached a record high. Israel was among the countries battling a new spike, announcing a three-week lockdown from Friday under which people will not be allowed more than 500 metres from their homes. The announcement sparked a wave of anger. ""It's unfair!"" said Eti Avishai, a 64-year-old seamstress. ""They didn't stop the big gatherings in synagogues, the weddings and the other events, and now I can't be with my children and grandchildren during the holidays?"" The World Health Organization reported 307,930 new cases worldwide on Sunday, the highest daily figure since the beginning of the pandemic in China late last year, as global cases rapidly approach 29 million. ""It's going to get tougher. In October, November, we are going to see more mortality,"" WHO Europe director Hans Kluge told AFP in an interview. But he stressed that the pandemic was ""going to finish, at one moment or another"", as WHO Europe's 55 members started a two-day online meeting focusing on their response to the virus. The latest surge has sparked alarm across Europe -- a Czech expert warned that his country's health system faces being overwhelmed if the virus continues to spread at its current rate. It has also reheated the debate over how best to respond to the rise in infections, with England limiting social gatherings to no more than six people from Monday. On the other hand, millions of schoolchildren in other affected countries returned to their classrooms for the first time in months. Italian children were among the first in Europe to see their schools closed, and some 5.6 million returned for the first time in six months on Monday. Although officials said thousands of extra classrooms had been set up, there were concerns over a lack of surgical masks for teachers and a shortage of single-seat benches. Some southern Italian regions postponed their reopening, worried that they were not properly prepared. While Europe battles with rising infections, other parts of the world are tentatively easing restrictions. In a sign of a growing readiness to reopen, Saudi Arabia said it would partially lift a six-month suspension of international flights this week and South Korea said it would ease rules in and around the capital Seoul after cases declined. The backlash against the restrictions is also being factored in by beleaguered governments. Australian police arrested dozens at an anti-lockdown rally in Melbourne on Sunday after crowds defied stay-at-home orders, which came after rallies in Germany and Poland on Saturday attended by anti-vaccine campaigners, conspiracy theorists and far-right activists. Such rallies are relatively common in the United States, the hardest-hit nation in the world with more than 6.5 million infections and 194,000 deaths. President Donald Trump, under pressure for his campaigning for the economy to reopen in face of catastrophic figures, was criticised for holding big rallies over the weekend. ""Tonight, President Donald Trump is taking reckless and selfish actions that are putting countless lives in danger here in Nevada,"" state governor Steve Sisolak, who is from the rival Democratic Party, tweeted ahead of the Sunday rally. Trump, who used the rally to boast about his success dealing with the pandemic, called Sisolak a ""political hack"" and urged the crowd to ""tell your governor to open your state"". There was some good news in Britain, where regulators allowed clinical trials to resume on one of the most advanced experimental vaccines. Researchers on the joint AstraZeneca-Oxford University project, who hope to finish tests by the end of the year, had ""voluntarily paused"" the trial after a UK volunteer developed an unexplained illness. A vaccine is considered crucial to the fight against the virus, but the WHO's Kluge said the public should not put all their hopes on a single drug. ""I hear the whole time: 'the vaccine is going to be the end of the pandemic'. Of course not,"" he said, explaining that the end of the pandemic would come when communities learn to live with the disease. Meanwhile, the wider effects of the pandemic are biting hard on medical staff and strained health systems. ""I gave birth a fortnight ago, and once you're in hospital you realise that the nurses, the carers... they don't have the means,"" said Severine at a rally in Brussels on Sunday for better health funding. ""They're always being asked for more, always too much, they're exhausted."" "
"BERLIN: A plane carrying Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, who is in a coma after a suspected poisoning, touched down early Saturday in Berlin, where he will be treated in the German capital's main hospital. Navalny's spokeswoman and a representative of the NGO that arranged the flight confirmed that the plane had landed. âNavalny is in Berlin,â Jaka Bizilj, of the German organisation Cinema For Peace, told The Associated Press. Navalny, a 44-year-old politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, was admitted to an intensive care unit in the Siberian city of Omsk on Thursday. His supporters believe that tea he drank was laced with poison â and that the Kremlin is behind both his illness and the delay in transferring him to a top German hospital. He was allowed to be transported to Germany only after much wrangling that his supporters denounced as a ploy by authorities to stall until any poison in his system would be no longer traceable. He was flown in to Berlin on a plane organized by supporters that was equipped with advanced medical equipment and accompanied by German medical specialists. When German specialists arrived aboard a plane equipped with advanced medical equipment Friday morning at his family's behest, Navalny's physicians in Omsk initially said he was too unstable to move. Navalny's supporters denounced that as a ploy by authorities to stall until any poison in his system would no longer be traceable. The Omsk medical team relented only after a charity that had organized the medevac plane revealed that the German doctors examined the politician and said he was fit to be transported. Deputy chief doctor of the Omsk hospital Anatoly Kalinichenko then told reporters that Navalny's condition had stabilized and that physicians âdidn't mindâ transferring the politician, given that his relatives were willing âto take on the risks.â The Kremlin denied that resistance to the transfer was political, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that it was purely a medical decision. However, the reversal came as international pressure on Russia's leadership mounted. It would not be the first time a prominent, outspoken Russian was targeted in such a way â or the first time the Kremlin was accused of being behind it. On Thursday, leaders of France and Germany said the two countries were ready to offer Navalny and his family any and all assistance and insisted on an investigation into what happened. The most prominent member of Russia's opposition, Navalny campaigned to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election but was barred from running. Since then, he has been promoting opposition candidates in regional elections, challenging members of the ruling party, United Russia. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption has been exposing graft among government officials, including some at the highest level. But he had to shut the foundation last month after a financially devastating lawsuit from a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin. Navalny fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Thursday and was taken to the hospital after the plane made an emergency landing. His team made arrangements to transfer him to CharitÃ©, a clinic in Berlin that has a history of treating famous foreign leaders and dissidents. Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, Navalny's physician in Moscow, told The Associated Press that being on a plane with specialized equipment, including a ventilator and a machine that can do the work of the heart and lungs, âcan be even safer than staying in a hospital in Omsk.â Navalny's spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh posted pictures of what she said was a bathroom inside the hospital that showed squalid conditions, including walls with paint peeling off, rusting pipes, and a dirty floor and walls. While his supporters and family members continue to insist that Navalny was poisoned, doctors in Omsk denied that and put forward another theory. The hospital's chief doctor, Alexander Murakhovsky, said in a video published by Omsk news outlet NGS55 that a metabolic disorder was the most likely diagnosis and that a drop in blood sugar may have caused Navalny to lose consciousness. Another doctor with ties to the politician, Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva, said that diagnosing Navalny with a âmetabolic disorderâ says nothing about what may have caused it â and it could have been the result of a poisoning. Ashikhmin, who has been Navalny's doctor since 2013, said the politician has always been in good health, regularly went for medical checkups and didn't have any underlying illnesses that could have triggered his condition. Western toxicology experts expressed doubts that a poisoning could have been ruled out so quickly. âIt takes a while to rule things out. And particularly if something is highly toxic â it will be there in very low concentrations, and many screening tests would just not pick that substance up,â said Alastair Hay, an emeritus professor and toxicology expert from the school of medicine at the University of Leeds. Like many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging an eye. Last year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from jail where he was serving a sentence on charges of violating protest regulations. His team also suspected poisoning then. "
"OMSK, Russia: Gravely ill Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was en route to Germany early on Saturday to receive medical care after the opposition politician's allies accused the Russian authorities of trying to stop his evacuation. Navalny's life was not in immediate danger, he was in an induced coma and his brain was in a stable condition, the medical staff at a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk said on Friday. Navalny was delivered to Omsk airport in an ambulance minutes after 0000 GMT and his plane took off two hours later, a Reuters witness said. Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said his wife Yulia was also on board. ""The fight for Alexei's life and health is just beginning and there is a long way to go, but at least the first step has been taken,"" Yarmysh wrote on Twitter. Navalny, a long-time opponent of President Vladimir Putin and a campaigner against corruption, collapsed on a plane on Thursday after drinking tea that his allies believe was laced with poison. German doctors flew in to evacuate Navalny, 44, at the request of his wife and allies who said they feared authorities might try to cover up clues as to how he fell ill and that the hospital treating him was badly equipped. Medical staff at the Omsk hospital initially said on Friday that while Navalny's condition had improved slightly overnight he was in too unstable a state to be safely transported out of the country. But late on Friday they said they would not object to him being moved after the German doctors were granted access to Navalny and said they thought he was fit to travel. A senior doctor at the hospital, Anatoly Kalinichenko, said the hospital could help transport Navalny to the airport and that he would be moved within several hours. ""We have taken the decision that we do not object to him being transferred to a different hospital,"" Kalinichenko said. WIFE'S APPEAL Navalny's wife Yulia earlier sent a letter to the Kremlin directly appealing for it to intervene and grant permission for him to be allowed to be flown out. ""It's a shame it took so long for the doctors to make this decision. The plane has been waiting since morning, the documents were also ready then,"" Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said on Friday evening. Alexander Murakhovsky, the head doctor at the hospital, said earlier that Navalny had been diagnosed with a metabolic disease that may have been caused by low blood sugar. He said traces of industrial chemical substances had been found on Navalny's clothes and fingers and that doctors did not believe he had been poisoned. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level graft and mobilising crowds of young protesters. He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings and rallies and sued over his investigations into corruption. He was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018. Navalny fell ill while flying back to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk where had met allies ahead of regional elections next month. He was taken on a stretcher, motionless, from the plane and rushed to hospital after it made an emergency landing in Omsk. "
"VIENNA: Austria is experiencing the start of a second wave of coronavirus infections, its chancellor said Sunday, as cases spike upwards in line with other EU countries. From Friday to Saturday, the Alpine nation of nearly nine million people reported 869 new cases -- more than half of those in the capital Vienna. ""What we are experiencing is the beginning of the second wave,"" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement, appealing to the population to stick to anti-virus measures and reduce social contacts. He warned that the mark of 1,000 cases per day would be reached soon. France reported 10,000 new infections on Saturday, close to the level of the peak of the first wave in April, while Britain introduced new restrictions on gatherings last week as the number of new daily infections surged to around 3,500. On Friday, Kurz announced the government would expand mandatory mask-wearing and slap new restrictions on events from Monday. Masks will be compulsory in all shops and public buildings, in addition to places where they must already be worn such as supermarkets and public transport. The conservative leader has warned the government could introduce further measures if cases kept rising but would try to avoid a repeat of the lockdown imposed in March, which entailed severe restrictions on movement and the closure of shops and restaurants. Austria has so far been able to avoid the brunt of the health crisis. Total coronavirus infections currently stand at more than 33,000 with around 750 deaths. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump, in a farewell address released on Tuesday, touted his legacy and wished luck to the new administration of President-elect Joe Biden but without acknowledging his successor by name. Trump has refused to offer a full concession to Democrat Biden, who won the November 3 election with 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232. Biden will be inaugurated at 12:00pm EST (1700 GMT) on Wednesday and Trump is not meeting with Biden beforehand or attending the swearing in as is customary in the handover of power to the White House. Trump instead plans to fly to Florida. Joe Biden inauguration live updates""This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous,"" the Republican president said in recorded remarks. ""We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck - a very important word."" 'Pray' for Biden team, says Trump on last day in officeTrump campaigned on a pledge to ""Make America Great Again"" but leaves office with more than 400,000 people dead of the novel coronavirus - the most in the world - whose risk he played down, an economy struggling from the pandemic, and relationships strained with key US allies. ""The greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness,"" Trump said. For months Trump said without evidence that the election was rigged against him and applied pressure on state officials to overturn the results. At a rally near the White House on January 6 he encouraged followers to march on Congress while lawmakers were certifying Biden's win. @POTUS resets as Twitter juggles presidential accountsTrump has been holed up at the White House for the final weeks of his term, reeling after the riot by his supporters at the Capitol that led to five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer. The stampede, which followed a rally in which Trump repeated false allegations of election fraud and urged his supporters to fight, has overshadowed any efforts to emphasize the president's legacy in his final days in office. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on a charge of incitement, making him the first president in US history to be impeached twice. He will have to face the charges after leaving office. In Tuesday's farewell, without specifically mentioning Twitter's decision to suspend his @realDonaldTrump account, Trump made reference to his complaint that free speech had been muzzled by the company. Twitter said it suspended the account because of the risk of the incitement of further violence. ""Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions,"" Trump said. ""America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree."" In the recorded remarks Trump sought to highlight aspects of his presidency in which he took pride. ""We did what we came here to do, and so much more,"" he said. ""I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices â because thatâs what you elected me to do."" Trump noted Middle East peace deals his administration brokered and lauded his foreign policy agenda. ""We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before,"" he said. ""I am especially proud to be the first president in decades who has started no new wars."" Trump, who leaves amid deep divisions in the country, acknowledged the Capitol riots, which in the immediate aftermath of the violence he was slow to condemn. ""All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated,"" he said. And the president, who former advisers predict has lost much of a political future after the riots, suggested his movement would go on. ""Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning,"" Trump said. ""I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart and optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come."" "
"WASHINGTON: House impeachment managers asked former US President Donald Trump on Thursday to testify during the Senate impeachment trial about his conduct on January 6. The move was immediately described as a ""public relations stunt"" by his lawyers. In a letter, lead impeachment manager Jamie Raskin requested Trump to provide testimony under oath, either before or during the Senate impeachment trial, about his conduct on January 6. The letter comes after Trump's legal team filed an answer to the Article of Impeachment, denying incontrovertible facts about the president's conduct on and leading up to January 6 and asserting that ""...the 45th president of the United States performed admirably in his role as president, at all times doing what he thought was in the best interests of the American people"". Trump's lawyers Bruce L Castor and David I Dchoen were quick to decline the ask. ""We are in receipt of your latest public relations stunt,"" they wrote. ""As you know, there is no such thing as a negative inference in this unconstitutional proceeding,"" they said. ""Your letter only confirms what is known to everyone: you cannot prove your allegations against the 45th president of the United States, who is now a private citizen,"" the letter continued. ""The use of our Constitution to bring a purported impeachment proceeding is much too serious to play these games,"" it said. In his letter to Trump, Raskin wrote, ""Two days ago, you filed an answer, in which you denied many factual allegations set forth in the article of impeachment. You have thus attempted to put critical facts at issue notwithstanding the clear and overwhelming evidence of your constitutional offense. ""In light of your disputing these factual allegations, I write to invite you to provide testimony under oath, either before or during the Senate impeachment trial, concerning your conduct on January 6, 2021. We would propose that you provide your testimony (of course including cross-examination) as early as Monday, February 8, 2021, and not later than Thursday, February 11, 2021. We would be pleased to arrange such testimony at a mutually convenient time and place."" ""If you decline this invitation, we reserve any and all rights, including the right to establish at trial that your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference regarding your actions (and inaction) on January 6, 2021,"" he said. In a statement, Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, said Trump would not participate. ""The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding,"" he said. Reacting to Miller's statement, Raskin said, ""Today, we offered President Trump the opportunity to testify about the events of January 6 and he refused to do so. Despite his lawyers' rhetoric, any official accused of inciting armed violence against the government of the United States should welcome the chance to testify openly and honestly -- that is, if the official had a defence. We will prove at the trial that President Trump's conduct was indefensible. His immediate refusal to testify speaks volumes and plainly establishes an adverse inference supporting his guilt."" "
"SAN FRANCISCO: Image-centric social network Snapchat on Wednesday said it has permanently banned US President Donald Trump from the platform, as voices are raised against keeping him off the internet stage. Trump's access to social media has been largely cut off since a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington DC in a deadly attack on January 6. Operators fear that Trump could use his Snapchat account to foment more unrest in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. ""Last week we announced an indefinite suspension of president Trump's Snapchat account,"" Snapchat said in response to an AFP inquiry. ""In the interest of public safety, and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence, which are clear violations of our guidelines, we have made the decision to permanently terminate his account."" After the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, social media including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube began to bar him from using their platforms. Google and Apple pulled Parler apps from their shops for digital content shops stating that the right-leaning social network was allowing users to promote violence. Amazon Web Services later ousted Parler from its data-centers, essentially forcing the social network offline due to lack of hosting services. ""I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here,"" Twitter chief Jack Dorsey wrote in a tweet Wednesday. ""After a clear warning we'd take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter."" The actions angered ardent defenders of Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on Wednesday was for inciting ""insurrection."" Texas attorney general Ken Paxton on Wednesday said he is demanding that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Twitter explain why Trump is not welcomed on their platforms. Paxton maintained that the ""seemingly coordinated de-platforming"" of Trump ""silences those whose speech and political beliefs do not align with leaders of Big Tech companies."" The state attorney issued administrative subpoenas calling on the technology companies to share their policies and practices regarding content moderation as well as for information directly related to Parler social network. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump left plenty of clues he'd try to burn the place down on his way out the door. The clues spread over a lifetime of refusing to acknowledge defeat. They spanned a presidency marked by raw, angry rhetoric, puffed-up conspiracy theories and a kind of fellowship with âpatriotsâ drawn from the seething ranks of right-wing extremists. The clues piled on at light speed when Trump lost the election and wouldn't admit it. Democrats plan lightning Trump impeachment, want him out nowThe culmination of all that came Wednesday when Trump supporters, exhorted by the president to go to the Capitol and âfight like hellâ against a âstolenâ election, overran and occupied the building in an explosive confrontation that left a Capitol Police officer and four others dead. The mob went there so emboldened by Trump's send-off at a rally that his partisans live-streamed themselves trashing the place. Trump, they figured, had their back. This was, after all, the president who had responded to a right-wing plot to kidnap Michigan's Democratic governor last year with the comment: âMaybe it was a problem. Maybe it wasn't.â Over the arc of his presidency and his life, by his own words and actions, Trump hated losing and wouldn't own up to it when it happened. He spun bankruptcies into successes, setbacks in office into glowing achievements, the stain of impeachment into martyrdom. Then came the ultimate loss, the election, and desperate machinations that politicians likened to the practices of âbanana republics"" or the ""Third Worldâ but were wholly America in the twilight of the Trump presidency. Often with a wink and a nod over the last four tears, sometimes more directly â âWe love you,â he told the Capitol Hill mob as he gently suggested well into the clashes that they go home now â Trump made common cause with fringe elements eager to give him affirmation in return for his respect. That made for a combustible mix when the stakes were highest. The elements had been coming together in plain sight, often in missives delivered by tweet. (On Friday, Twitter banned Trump's account, denying him his megaphone of choice, ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence.â) âI wish we could say we couldn't see it coming,â President-elect Joe Biden said of the Capitol melee. ""But that isn't true. We could see it coming.â Mary Trump saw it coming from her unique vantage point as a clinical psychologist and Trump niece. âIt's just a very old emotion that he's never been able to process from when he was a little kid â terrified of the consequences of being in a losing position, terrified of being held accountable for his actions for the first time in his life,â she told PBS a week after the election. âHe is in a position of being a loser, which in my family, certainly ... was the worst possible thing you could be,â she said. âSo he's feeling trapped, he's feeling desperate ... increasingly enraged."" Post-election trouble was predictable because Trump all but said it would happen if he lost. Months before a vote was cast, he claimed the system was rigged and plans for mail-in voting fraudulent, assailing the process so relentlessly that he may have hurt his chances by discouraging his supporters from voting by mail. He pointedly declined to assure the country in advance that he would respect the result, something most presidents don't have to be asked to do. There was no evidence before the election that it would be tainted and no evidence after of the massive fraud or gross error that he and his team alleged in scores of lawsuits that judges, whether appointed by Republicans, Democrats or Trump himself, systematically dismissed, often as nonsense. The Supreme Court, with three justices placed by Trump, brushed him off. That didn't stop him. âI hate defeat,"" he said in a 2011 video. âI cannot stand defeat.â But the election aftermath ultimately left him with no fallback except his foot soldiers, who couldn't countenance his losing, either. Trump's history of advancing false and sometimes racist conspiracies rooted in right-wing extremism is long. He's praised supporters of QAnon, a convoluted pro-Trump conspiracy theory, saying he didn't know much about the movement âother than I understand they like me very muchâ and âit is gaining in popularity.â QAnon centers on an alleged anonymous, high-ranking government official known as âQâ who shares information about an anti-Trump âdeep state.â The FBI has warned that conspiracy theory-driven extremists, such as QAnon, are domestic terrorist threats. In 2017, Trump said there was âblame on both sidesâ for deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, the site of a standoff between white supremacist groups and those protesting them. He said there were âfine peopleâ on both sides. And during a debate with Biden, Trump wouldn't criticize the neo-fascist Proud Boys. Instead, Trump said the group should âStand back and stand by.â The remark drew a firestorm and a day later he tried to walk it back. Trump didn't condemn the actions of an Illinois teen accused of fatally shooting two people and wounding a third during summer protests on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kyle Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to charges. "
"WASHINGTON: An increasingly isolated and angry President Donald Trump, cut off by Twitter in the waning days of his term, faces a renewed drive by Democrats to remove him from office after he incited his supporters to storm the US Capitol. Twitter permanently cut off Trump's personal account and access to his nearly 90 million followers late on Friday, citing the risk of further incitement of violence, three days after Trump exhorted thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress met to certify his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. The resulting chaos, viewed with shock around the world, left a police officer and four others dead in its wake. Trump's frequent use of Twitter was a key part of his campaign as he overhauled the Republican Party and beat Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the presidency in 2016. Since then he has used it to fire up his political base, attacking those who opposed him. Twitter has long resisted pressure to suspend Trump's account. But after a ""close review"" of the president's recent tweets, the company said on Friday evening it ""had permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence."" Trump later used the official @POTUS government to lash out at Twitter, addressing the 75 million ""great patriots"" who voted for him: ""We will not be SILENCED!"" Trump said he was considering building his own social media platform. Twitter quickly deleted those posts and soon after suspended the Trump campaign account. The suspension came a day after a subdued Trump denounced Wednesday's violence in a video in which he also vowed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Calls to resignHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday that if Trump did not resign, she had instructed the House Rules Committee to move ahead with a motion for impeachment and legislation on the US Constitution's 25th Amendment, which provides for removal of a president who is unable to discharge his official duties. A copy of draft articles of impeachment circulating among members of Congress charged Trump with ""inciting violence against the government of the United States"" in a bid to overturn his loss to Biden. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell sent a memo to Republican senators detailing a possible timetable for an impeachment trial. He noted the Senate will hold its next work session on Jan. 19 and needs the consent of all 100 senators to convene sooner - meaning a trial would not begin until Trump was out of office, a source familiar with the document said. ""Impeaching President Donald Trump with 12 days remaining in his presidency would only serve to further divide the country,"" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Thursday and Friday found 57% Americans want Trump to be removed immediately from office following the violence. Trump's role in encouraging Wednesday's chaos has opened a growing rift within the Republican Party. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News he would ""definitely consider"" impeachment because the president ""disregarded his oath of office."" Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said Friday Trump should resign immediately and if the party cannot separate itself from him, she is not certain she has a future with it. ""I want him out. He has caused enough damage,"" the Alaska senator told the Anchorage Daily News. It is unclear whether lawmakers would be able to remove Trump from office, as any impeachment would prompt a trial in the Senate, where his fellow Republicans still hold power and two-thirds of the 100 members must vote to convict for his removal. The House impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, but the Senate acquitted him in February 2020. For the 25th Amendment to be invoked, Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of Trumpâs Cabinet would need to declare Trump is unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Pence is opposed to the idea of using the amendment, an adviser said. "
"WASHINGTON: A defeated and seemingly chastened US President Donald Trump on Thursday called for ""healing and reconciliation"" and pledged a smooth and orderly transition of power"" amid moves to impeach him and calls to remove him from office for his role in inciting mob violence even though only 12 days of his presidency remain. With the establishment Republican Party abandoning him and two cabinet members and several administration officials resigning over his incendiary role in the attack on the US Capitol, a subdued Trump claimed he was ""outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem"" and called for cooling of tempers in the face of charges across the board that he instigated his supporters. ""Congress has certified the results, and a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth orderly and seamless transition of power,"" Trump said in video message read on a teleprompter in what is the closest he has come to conceding defeat. In a tweet on Friday morning, he also announced that he will not attend Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1610120668000President Donald Trump won't attend Joe Biden's inaugurationTrump's capitulation came soon after a police officer who was injured in what is now being described in some quarters as a terrorist attack by the President's supporters on the US Capitol died, bringing to five the fatalities in the barbaric event. The cop was reportedly hit over the head with a fire extinguisher by the MAGA mob, triggering a murder investigation. The disgraced President, called sick and mentally unstable by some conservative pundits who long glossed over his excesses, taped the message after he was reportedly warned by a White House counsel that he could face legal charges for stoking the mob. His administration's own Justice Department did not rule out the possibility. ""We are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the (US Capitol) building,"" Michael Sherwin, the US attorney in Washington, said at a press conference. Democratic lawmakers in Congress began drawing up articles of impeachment which some Republicans pledged to support. The party's leadership- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate leader Chuck Schumer- though said they preferred the Trump cabinet invoke the 25th amendment to remove the President from office, and only if it failed would they consider impeachment, for which there is very little time. Pelosi and Schumer said they tried calling Pence to discuss the issue but he did not take their call. Meanwhile, at least two Trump cabinet members - transportation secretary Elaine Chao, who is married to Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and education secretary Betsy Devos, resigned, ostensibly to avoid taking a call on the 25th amendment, although they castigated Trump for instigating violence. Like many Republican officials and lawmakers, they stood by Trump and enabled him through his most grotesque excesses over four years, including inciting supporters against the media, encouraging violence against critics and protestors, and lampooning the disabled. Trump's scripted remarks, in which he did not congratulate or welcome the incoming President, were greeted with scorn and likened to a hostage video made under duress, with critics expecting ""Teleprompter Trump"" to return to his usual inflammatory self once the crisis has passed. Trump concluding his video message saying, ""To all of my wonderful supporters. I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning."" "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump opened an office in Florida on Monday that will handle his duties as a former US president and seek to further his administration's agenda. ""The Office will be responsible for managing President Trump's correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump Administration through advocacy, organizing, and public activism,"" a statement said. The announcement came on the same day the House of Representatives delivered to the Senate an impeachment article charging Trump with inciting insurrection in a speech to supporters before the deadly attack on the Capitol on January 6. The Senate trial is expected to start on February 9. In farewell remarks on his last day as president last Wednesday, Trump told supporters: ""We will be back in some form."" Trump has made no public appearances since flying that day to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Before leaving office, Trump talked with associates about forming a political party called the ""Patriot Party,"" the Wall Street Journal reported. Before leaving office, he pursued unsuccessful legal challenges to overturn his November 3 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, falsely claiming there had been widespread electoral fraud. "
"SANTA FE (US): Protesters backing President Donald Trump massed outside statehouses from Georgia to New Mexico on Wednesday, leading some officials to evacuate while cheers rang out at several demonstrations as a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol. Hundreds of people gathered in state capitals nationwide to oppose President-elect Joe Biden's win, waving signs saying âStop the stealâ and âFour more years.â Most of them didn't wear masks amid the coronavirus pandemic, and some carried guns in places like Oklahoma, Georgia, Arizona and Washington state. There were some scuffles with counterprotesters in states like Ohio and California, and a newspaper photographer was pepper-sprayed by a protester in Utah, but most demonstrations were peaceful â some of them quite small â and only a few arrests were reported. New Mexico police evacuated staff as a precaution from a Statehouse building that includes the governor's office and the secretary of state's office, shortly after hundreds of flag-waving supporters arrived in a vehicle caravan and on horseback. Demonstrators sang âGod Bless America,â honked horns and wrongly announced on a megaphone that Trump was the rightful election winner â though Biden won the vote in New Mexico by a margin of roughly 11 per cent. âIt's the first time in the history of the United States that the peaceful transfer of power has been slowed by an act of violence,"" Democratic House Speaker Brian Egolf said. âIt is a shameful moment, and I hope that the Congress can recover soon.â Violent protests in Washington, DC, came as Congress tried to affirm Biden's Electoral College victory. News that protesters had breached the US Capitol set off cheers at pro-Trump protests in Minnesota, Nevada and Arizona, where armed protesters marched at the Capitol in Phoenix and several men displayed a guillotine. Georgia's secretary of state and his staff evacuated their offices at the Capitol as about 100 protesters gathered outside, some armed with long guns. Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger and his team decided to leave, according to Gabriel Sterling, a top official with Raffensperger's office. âWe saw stuff happening at the Georgia Capitol and said we should not be around here, we should not be a spark,â Sterling told The Associated Press. Trump has focused much of his ire on Raffensperger in the weeks following his loss by about 12,000 votes. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp slammed the storming of the U.S. Capitol, calling it âa disgrace and quite honestly un-American.â Kemp said he was extending an executive order from protests over the summer activating the National Guard in case they are needed to protect the state Capitol on Monday when the legislative session begins. "
"The House on Wednesday impeached President Donald Trump for inciting a violent insurrection against the United States government, as 10 members of the presidentâs party joined Democrats to charge him with high crimes and misdemeanors for an unprecedented second time. Reconvening under the threat of continued violence and the protection of thousands of National Guard troops, the House was determined to hold Trump to account just one week before he was to leave office. At issue was his role in encouraging a mob that attacked the Capitol one week ago while Congress met to affirm President-elect Joe Bidenâs victory, forcing lawmakers to flee for their lives in a deadly rampage. The House adopted a single article of impeachment, voting 232-197 to charge Trump with âinciting violence against the government of the United Statesâ and requesting his immediate removal from office and disqualification from ever holding one again. Ten Republicans joined Democrats in voting to impeach: Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the partyâs No. 3 leader in the House; Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse of Washington; John Katko of New York; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; Fred Upton and Peter Meijer of Michigan; Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio; David Valadao of California and Tom Rice of South Carolina. 1/12US House impeaches Trump for a second time; 10 Republicans vote yes Previous NextShow CaptionsImpeachment Article Engrossment ceremony against U.S. President Donald Trump at the US Capitol in Washington.

(Reuters)The defections were a remarkable break from the head of the party by Republicans, who voted unanimously against impeaching Trump just over a year ago. The vote set the stage for the second Senate trial of Trump in a year, though senators appeared unlikely to convene to sit in judgment before Jan. 20, when Biden will take the oath of office. The last proceeding, over Trumpâs attempts to pressure Ukraine to smear Biden, was a partisan affair. This time, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, was said to support the effort as a means of purging his party of Trump, setting up a political and constitutional showdown that could shape the course of American politics when the nation remains dangerously divided. In a note to Republican colleagues on Wednesday, McConnell did not deny that he backed the impeachment push, but he said that he had ânot made a final decision on how I will vote, and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.â Trump showed no contrition for his actions. But in the run-up to the vote Wednesday, he issued a statement urging his supporters to remain peaceful as federal authorities warned of a nationwide wave of violence surrounding Bidenâs inauguration. âThere must be no violence, no lawbreaking and no vandalism of any kind,â the president said in a statement that was read by Republicans from the House floor. âThat is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on all Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.â The Houseâs vote was historic. Only two other presidents have been impeached; none has been impeached twice, by such a large bipartisan margin, or so close to leaving office. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California implored colleagues before the vote to embrace âa constitutional remedy that will ensure that the Republic will be safe from this man who is so resolutely determined to tear down the things that we hold dear and that hold us together.â âHe must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love,â she said, adding later, âIt gives me no pleasure to say this â it breaks my heart.â Republicans, who stood unanimously behind Trump in 2019 during his first impeachment, were split over the charge this time. Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, spoke out against impeachment, warning that it would âfurther fan the flames of partisan division.â But he also pinned blame on Trump for the attack and batted down false suggestions from some of his colleagues that antifa had actually been responsible for the siege, not loyalists to Trump. He proposed censuring the president instead of impeaching him. âThe president bears responsibility for Wednesdayâs attack on Congress by mob rioters,â McCarthy said. âHe should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.â Democrats and some Republicans had tried â briefly â to take another course. They urged Trump to resign voluntarily and voted late Tuesday to call on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to wrest the powers of the presidency from Trump for the remainder of his term. Trump refused, and so did Pence. "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump and his violent MAGA minions are being run out of polite company, civic society, mainstream media, and the so-called Big Tech- all seen as ""radical left"" bastions by the extremist right-wing mob- even as the defeated President faces an unprecedented second impeachment process starting Monday. From tech platforms to airlines to industry and government, America is identifying and weeding out MAGA extremists, many of whom stormed the US Capitol last week after being incited by Trump, resulting in violence, mayhem, and five deaths. Dozens of so-called ""protestors"" are being arrested on the basis of photos and footage aired- sometimes by themselves- of their violent insurrection. Many are regretting and recanting their support for Trump as they lose jobs and lose face in civil society, even as the establishment Republican Party is distancing itself from the disgraced President. Trump and his Twitter fetish has been shut up, and efforts by the departing President and his followers to decamp to an alternative platform more accommodating of their extremist, conspiratorial views and lies has been shut down by Big Tech. On Saturday, Amazon joined Google, Apple, and Twitter in shutting of the extremist spigot, telling Parler, the right-wing echo chamber, that it will lose access to servers. Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account, deletes his new tweets on @POTUS, suspends campaign accountAirlines, airline pilots and stewards' bodies have served notice that MAGA people exhibiting crude, coarse behavior will not be welcome on board and make it to no-fly lists. In one incident over the weekend, the pilot of an American Airlines flight from Washington DC to Phoenix warned that he would land his flight in the middle of Kansas to dump unruly MAGA ""patriots"" chanting slogans as they returned from the Trump rally. In a video posted online, the pilot is heard saying, ""This is the way it's gonna beâ¦ it's a four and a half hour flight to Phoenix... We'll put this plane down in the middle of Kansas and dump people off â I don't care. We will do that if that's what it takes, so behave, please."" Excoriated across the board for his incitement and invective, an embattled Trump, who said he will not be silenced, is finding it hard to reach his supporters without social media and mainstream press echoing his message as it did for more than four years. All but his most hard-core allies are deserting him amid reports that vice-president Mike Pence has taken charge of the cabinet to help transition while running down the clock with ten days go for the inauguration. Democrats plan lightning Trump impeachment, want him out nowThe two men (Trump and Pence) have not been seen together or spoken with each other for several days now. The vice-president is said to be deeply upset by Trump-triggered MAGA mob roaming the hallways of Congress looking for him and chanting ""Hang Mike Pence."" A noose was strung on wooden gallows the mob set up outside the Capitol, and an air force combat veteran photographed with zip tie handcuffs, which triggered fears of hostage-taking, has been arrested. On Saturday, Twitter deleted the grotesque ""HangMikePence"" hashtag that trended briefly. Trump, according to reports, has not even bothered to call Pence to inquire about his safety after the vice-president and his family had to bunker in the Capitol building to escape the MAGA hordes. Their rift is now very public and obvious. Pence's aides have said he will attend the Biden inauguration; Trump has said he will not. The political rift has cleaved the Republican Party, with the establishment wing set to allow- if not support- the impeachment process to be initiated by Democrats on Monday. Over the weekend, Republican Senator Pat Toomey joined the ranks of Trump critics, saying the President ""descended into a level of madness and engaged in activity that was absolutely unthinkable and unforgivable."" Trump has also not called the family of the Capitol Hill police officer who died at the hands of the MAGA mob, although, according to his friends, he was a Trump supporter. In fact, family members of several Trump supporters, including a woman who died in the stampede, are blaming the defeated President for triggering violence. ""It's my own personal belief that the President's words incited a riot that killed four of his biggest fans,"" the family of Rosanne Boyland, who was trampled to death in the Capitol Rotunda, said. The grandmother of a Republican lawmaker from Virginia who was arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct blamed Trump for the violence, and the 18-year old daughter of a Trump supporter trolled her mom by posting a video of her injured in the violence with the message, ""Hi mom remember the time you told me I shouldn't go to BLM protests bc they could get violent...this you?"" Many Trump supporters- prominent and otherwise- are having second thoughts about a President who tapped into a poisonous racist vein in America, even as some liberals have begun drawing up watchlists to remind them of their unstinting support to a man they see as ""unhinged,"" warning the enablers they won't have a pretty future in civil society.

"WASHINGTON: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke to the top US military commander on Friday about taking precautions to ensure that Republican President Donald Trump cannot initiate hostilities or order a nuclear strike in his remaining 12 days in office. Pelosi said in a letter to Democratic lawmakers that she spoke to Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about what measures are available to rein in the Republican president. Trump, angry about his election loss, incited supporters in the days before an invasion of the US Capitol on Wednesday. ""The situation of this unhinged president could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,"" Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues. While Pelosi's letter highlights the concern among lawmakers about what Trump may try to do during his remaining time in office, there are questions about what Milley or anyone could actually do to stop a president from using nuclear weapons. ""There is no legal way to do this. The president has sole, unfettered authority to order the use of nuclear weapons with no 'second vote' required,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California. Milley's office said that Pelosi had initiated the call and Milley ""answered her questions regarding the process of nuclear command authority."" A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that any use of nuclear weapons is a highly deliberative process. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Trump said earlier on Friday he would not attend the inauguration, breaking with long-standing tradition in American presidential transitions. Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, also said she had not heard back from Vice President Mike Pence about whether he would agree to top Democrats' request that he invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office ""for his incitement of insurrection and the danger he still poses."" She said ""we still hope to hear from him as soon as possible with a positive answer."" Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate have said that if Pence does not agree to the request, Democrats were prepared to impeach Trump a second time. "
"GEORGIA: Coronavirus vaccines will be made available in the US next week, US President Donald Trump said at the Saturday rally in Valdosta, Georgia. ""Vaccines are on their way at a level that nobody ever thought possible, it would have taken another administration five years, it took us seven months, and they're starting next week, and we're going to start vaccinating, and a lot of people are already vaccinated,"" Trump said. Earlier this week, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee voted to give healthcare workers and nursing home residents the first of the COVID-19 vaccines once the doses are rolled out, within three weeks. CDC slides released at a live-streamed meeting this week showed the agency expected around 40 million COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of December, with weekly shipments of 5 million to 10 million doses expected once a vaccine is authorized by regulators. According to Moncef Slaoui, an adviser to the Trump administration's ""Operation Warp Speed"" plan on the vaccines, some 60 million to 70 million doses could be available per month beginning in January, after the expected US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US has surpassed 14.5 million. More than 281,000 people have died from the coronavirus infection in the US, which has the highest COVID-19 death toll and the largest number of confirmed cases of all the countries in the world. "
"Former President Donald Trump has abruptly parted ways with five lawyers handling his impeachment defence, just over a week before the Senate trial is set to begin, people familiar with the situation said on Saturday. Those departures include his lead lawyer, Butch Bowers, a person familiar with the situation said. Four other lawyers who were reported to be joining, including Deborah Barbier, a criminal defence lawyer in South Carolina, are also leaving, according to multiple people familiar with the situation. Trump had pushed for his defence team to focus on his baseless claim that the election was stolen from him, one person familiar with the situation said. A person close to Trump disputed that that was the case but acknowledged that there were differences in opinion about the defence strategy. However, Trump has insisted that the case is âsimpleâ and has told advisers he could argue it himself. (Aides contend he is not seriously contemplating doing so.) The decision for Bowers to leave was âmutual,â another person said, adding that Trump and Bowers had no chemistry. Bowers has been noticeably absent in the news media since his hiring was announced. Jason Miller, a Trump adviser, said th at the former president and his aides had ânot made a final decision on our legal teamâ. Bowers is the only lawyer whom Trumpâs aides had confirmed would defend the former president. Senator Lindsey Graham was said to have helped line up Bowers, who was working to establish a broader team. The departures of Bowers and Barbier were previously reported by CNN. A third lawyer, Josh Howard is also no longer part of the team, another person familiar with the situation said. And two other lawyers from South Carolina, Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris, will also no longer be involved, one of the people familiar with the situation said. Trump is due to file a response to the House charges by Tuesday. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has said that White House staffers should not be among the first in the country, currently the hardest-hit by the pandemic, to receive the coronavirus vaccinations. Taking to Twitter on Sunday, the President said: ""People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary. I have asked that this adjustment be made. ""I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time."" In a statement to The Hill news website sent earlier on Sunday, National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said: ""Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy. ""The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the US government on the advice of public health professionals and national security leadership."" Trump's remarks came a day before the first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine will begin arriving in US states from Monday onwards. On December 12, Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, had said that shipping companies UPS and FedEx will deliver the vaccine to nearly 150 state locations, Xinhua news agency reported. On December 11, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued authorization for emergency use of the Covid-19 vaccine of American drugmaker Pfizer in partnership with German company BioNTech, the first vaccine against the disease in the country. The emergency use authorization allows the vaccine to be distributed in the country. The FDA said the totality of the available data provides clear evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be effective in preventing the virus. The US currently account for the world's highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths. In its latest update on Monday, the Johns Hopkins University revealed that the country's overall caseload and death toll stood 16,246,771 and 299,163, respectively. "
"WASHINGTON: With US President Donald Trump refusing to concede in the recently concluded Presidential election to President-elect Joe Biden, sources say that First Lady Melania Trump 'wants to go home'. According to sources, while Melania ""publicly agrees"" with the President's sentiment, ""the first lady tasked an emissary with discreetly finding out what was available to her in terms of budget and staff allocation for post-White House life."" ""She just wants to go home,"" said a source familiar with Melania's mindset adding that it might not ""go over well"" if the soon-to-be-former President announces his bid to clinch the White House again in 2024. The American media outlet reported that while there are 'presidential perks' for such things for the outgoing commander in chief, budgets to set up an official office and staff and cover some travel costs, there is nothing from the government for any first lady, save a paltry $20,000-a-year pension, which is paid out only if her husband dies. Trump is focused on her legacy and she is considering a book though it would not be a memoir but ""is toying"" with the idea of writing a photo-centric book. ""Mrs. Trump is focused on her role as the first lady. Monday she unveiled her most current effort in preserving the White House by announcing the completion of the tennis pavilion. She also recently unveiled a new piece of art in the newly renovated Rose Garden. Her office just revealed this year's Christmas decor. Her schedule remains full with her duties as a mother, wife and first lady of the United States,"" the first lady's chief of staff Stephanie Grisham told CNN. A source said that Trump is now focused on Mar-a-Lago ""ensuring a smooth transition out of Washington for herself and her 14-year-old-son, Barron"". The source further said that the First Lady is ""already overseeing shipments of personal items to Mar-a-Lago from both the White House and her Trump Tower penthouse in New York City"". Biden is being projected as the winner of the Presidential elections in the US after he clinched the state of Pennsylvania to take him past the required 270 Electoral College-vote mark. "
"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said that his predecessor, Donald Trump, left him a âvery generous letterâ before leaving Washington ahead of his inauguration on Wednesday. Biden told reporters in the Oval Office: âThe president wrote a very generous letter. Because it was private, I will not talk about it until I talk to him.â The remarks came after Biden signed three executive actions, including a requirement for face masks on federal property and a measure that would re-enter the US into the Paris Agreement on climate. The signing was Bidenâs first press availability in the Oval Office, where some decor from the previous administration has been replaced. He sat at the Resolute Desk, the same desk Trump, Barack Obama and several other presidents have used. Busts of Martin Luther King Jr and Robert F Kennedy, whose careers inspired Bidenâs work in public service, flanked the roomâs fireplace. On a table behind the desk sat pictures of Bidenâs family and a bust of the labor leader Cesar Chavez. Trump departed Washington early Wednesday and arrived at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, before Biden was sworn in to replace him in the White House. After signing the actions, Biden swore-in about 1,000 political appointees at the White House and federal agencies, who participated via video conference in the East Room. âWe have to restore the soul of this country and Iâm counting on all of you,â he said. âWeâve reached a point, in my view, where the American people -- the blinders have been taken off.â He said that the governmentâs coronavirus vaccination program would be the âmost consequential logistical thing thatâs ever been done in the United States,â and that his administration âcan meet this existential threat of climate change.â But he also admonished his appointees to lead with âone core American value: humility and trust.â âIf you ever work with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I will fire you on the spot. No ifs, ands or buts,â Biden said. âEverybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity. Thatâs been missing in a big way the last four years.â In response to a question from a reporter, Biden said that heâs not concerned about his cabinet nominees being confirmed. The Senate has yet to fill any of his cabinet posts. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump began his final full day in the White House Tuesday with a long list of possible pardons to dish out before snubbing his successor Joe Biden's inauguration and leaving for Florida. On Wednesday at noon, Biden will be sworn in and the Trump presidency will end, turning the page on some of the most disruptive, divisive years the United States has seen since the 1960s. Biden, a veteran Democratic senator who also served as vice president to Barack Obama, was set to travel to Washington on Tuesday with his wife Dr Jill Biden from their hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Together with incoming vice president Kamala Harris -- the first woman ever to hold the job -- Biden was due to deliver an evening address on the Covid-19 crisis, from the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. By contrast, Trump has remained uncharacteristically silent as the clock ticks down to his departure to a new life in his Mar-a-Lago golf club residence in Palm Beach. Banned by Twitter for his stream of inflammatory messages and misinformation, he has largely stopped communicating with the nation. He has also yet to congratulate Biden or invite him for the traditional pre-inauguration cup of tea in the Oval Office. Instead, Trump has spent his time meeting with a dwindling circle of loyalists who backed him during a doomed, two-month effort to overturn the results of the November election. That effort culminated on January 6 with Trump encouraging a crowd to march on Congress. After the crowd broke through police, killing one officer, and trashed the hallowed Capitol building, Trump was impeached for the second time in just over a year -- another first in a presidency of many firsts. His final Gallup poll as president on Monday showed him exiting with 34 percent approval, his record low. Trump's overall average of 41 percent since taking office is also the lowest for any presidency's approval rating since Gallup began measuring in 1938. Biden, meanwhile, is putting the finishing touches to an inauguration that will feature a small crowd and massive security -- more fallout from the pro-Trump riot, on top of existing concerns about Covid-19. Trump issued a scattering of last-minute orders on Monday, most notably a lifting of the travel bans imposed because of the coronavirus on most of Europe and Brazil. Under Trump's order, borders were to have reopened from January 26, almost a week after he leaves office. Responding almost immediately, Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the measure would not stand. For Trump, the main piece of unfinished business is now the expected slew of pardons that he is reported to be preparing. According to CNN and other US outlets, Trump has a list of about 100 people he will grant clemency to. After what The New York Times reports has been an intense lobbying effort, these are expected to be a mix of white-collar criminals and people whose cases have been championed by criminal justice activists. More controversial possible pardons that have been the subject of speculation for months would be for the likes of Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Trump's influential advisor Stephen Bannon. If Trump gave himself or his family a pardon -- something currently not expected, according to latest US reports -- that would likely harden anger among previously fully supportive Republicans in the Senate, which is expected to start an impeachment trial soon after Biden takes office. Biden's inaugural speech is expected to focus on his appeals for Americans to reunite and to take on the Covid-19 pandemic with new seriousness. He is also set to announce a dramatic shift away from Trump's ""America First"" ideology, taking the United States back to its traditions of alliance-building. This will begin with the new president ordering the United States back into the Paris climate accord on day one. But the 78-year-old Democrat's fervent appeals for optimism and healing are running up against the hard reality of multiple crises. Covid-19 is out of control, vaccine distribution is stumbling, and economic recovery remains in the balance. And after Trump's refusal to accept the results of November's presidential election, the country is seething. Biden will take the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol under the protection of more than 20,000 National Guard soldiers. Checkpoints and large zones closed to ordinary citizens mean there will be only a smattering of guests. The acting defense secretary said Monday that the military and FBI were vetting the National Guard troopers, who carry automatic weapons, in case any of them pose a threat. Trump, the first president to lose reelection since George H.W. Bush was replaced by Bill Clinton, will also be the first ex-president to snub his successor's inauguration in a century and a half. On Wednesday, he will depart for Florida from the White House early, in order to benefit from full presidential travel privileges up to the last minute. Marine One will take him from the White House to Joint Base Andrews to catch Air Force One -- the presidential plane that, from noon, will no longer be his to use. According to a Bloomberg report, Trump is organizing a military sendoff for himself at Andrews, watched by a crowd of invitees. "
"WASHINGTON: Most ex-presidents spend their time out of office playing golf, getting their libraries in order, making well-paid speeches, writing even more lucrative memoirs and biting their tongues about what the next guy is doing. Other than the golf, the road ahead for Donald Trump, a president who has never adhered to his officeâs norms, will be unlike any other. We know where he will not be when his term ends at noon on Wednesday â heâs the first president since Andrew Johnson in 1869 to decline to attend his successorâs inauguration. But there is no clear answer yet on what he plans to do next. Even where he plans to live is potentially up in the air â though Trump says heâs moving to his Mar-a-Lago private club, some of his Palm Beach, Florida, neighbors are challenging his ability to live there full-time. In the near term and possibly longer, Trumpâs post-presidential options will be circumscribed by the fallout over his January 6 speech egging on the crowd that would go on to storm the US Capitol, including a historic second impeachment. If heâs convicted at the upcoming Senate trial, heâll almost certainly be barred from ever running for federal office again. For now, some of Corporate Americaâs biggest names are shunning the businessman president, âde-platformingâ him on social media and cutting him off from certain professional and financial services. Tens of millions of his fellow citizens will continue to revile him, rendering the Trump brand toxic to half the country and harming prospects for his real estate, hotel and golf resort empire. But tens of millions of other Americans are likely to form a durable base of support, making Trump a political force for years to come regardless of whether he seeks the presidency again. Deprived of his @realDonaldTrump megaphone and other online platforms, the former president will have to think of new ways to mobilize â and possibly monetize â his loyal followers. Though Trump will likely be frozen out of mainstream media opportunities, he could launch his own endeavors focused on his conservative base, perhaps a Trump network to go head-to-head with Fox News or a Trump social media site to compete with Twitter. Of course, thatâs assuming heâs not completely consumed by court battles once he leaves office. Even before the Capitol riot, he faced several lawsuits and potential criminal investigations. His wild election-fraud claims and possible incitement of the riot have only added to his legal risk. Thereâs a very real possibility that Trump could wind up in jail. Itâs probably not wise to count out Trump though. Widely dismissed after his 1990s Atlantic City casino bankruptcies, he came back strongly a decade later on âThe Apprentice.â Then, when his ratings began to wane, he latched on to the racist birther conspiracy about President Barack Obama and built a new, right-wing audience that ultimately carried him into the White House. Even his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden was by a much narrower margin than polls had predicted. As for that presidential library, normally a gleaming monument to a leaderâs achievements? There are no public plans yet, but comedian Luke Thayer and former Trump White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci have made some suggestions in their spoof djtrumplibrary.com site, including a âLie to Americaâ exhibition and a âgrift shop.â PoliticsBefore the Capitol riot, it looked like Trump would remain the Republican Party standard-bearer, either running for president himself again in 2024 or acting as kingmaker in the GOP field. He was also expected to exact revenge against a long line of Republicans who crossed him, most notably Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who refused to try to overturn Bidenâs election win in the state. But some believe January 6 changed all that. âWhen the Trump presidency is discussed in the near, medium and long term by anyone, all conversations will begin and end with the day of insurrection,â said Republican strategist and former George W. Bush White House aide Scott Jennings. âAnd I donât know how you ultimately go back to the American people and say, âPlease overlook that one day because it wasnât really our fault.â Well, yeah it was. It was your fault.â A January 15 Pew Research poll supports that view, finding only 29% job approval for Trump, with 68% of the sample saying they donât want him to remain a major political figure in the years to come. The riot has certainly exposed a rift in the GOP. Republican House Conference Chair Liz Cheney was one of 10 members who crossed party lines and joined Democrats in impeaching Trump for inciting insurrection. Several Republican senators, including Leader Mitch McConnell, have suggested they are open to convicting Trump, which would effectively end his 2024 run before it begins. Dozens of major US corporations, business groups and donors who typically back Republicans have said they will suspend or stop campaign contributions to candidates who supported Trumpâs challenge to the election results. But Trump is likely to maintain a grip on the populist wing of the GOP. That was evident on Jan. 8 when the Republican National Committee re-elected Trump allies Ronna Romney McDaniel and Tommy Hicks as chair and vice chair in what was widely viewed as a proxy fight over the outgoing presidentâs role in the party. Despite the defections, the vast majority of House Republicans opposed impeachment, and nearly two-thirds did Trumpâs bidding and objected to state-certified electoral votes for Biden even after the violence in Washington. Recent polls have shown that most Republican voters still support Trump and donât blame him for the Capitol riot. âThat doesnât go away overnight,â said Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mitt Romneyâs 2012 presidential campaign, said of Trumpâs popularity with the Republican base. âThat power that he has, that connection with the most active voices inside his movement, is very real and it still exists.â Social MediaAny political comeback will depend on Trump finding a new way to mobilize his base. The scale of his de-platforming is hard to overstate. His @realDonaldTrump account had more then 88 million followers before Twitter permanently banned him on Jan. 8 for breaking its rules against glorifying violence. He also lost access to more than 30 million Facebook friends when he was banned from that site indefinitely and at least through Bidenâs inauguration. The president still has ways to reach his most fervent fans though. The Official Trump 2020 Mobile App, which was used to register rally attendees and for direct messaging during the campaign, was downloaded 2.6 million times in the last year, with users required to input phone numbers and agree to be contacted, according to Apptopia. Nu Wexler, a communications consultant formerly with Google, Facebook and Twitter, said Trumpâs online footprint is still remarkable among Republican politicians. âHe has millions of cell numbers from events and a fundraising email list that dwarfs the rest of his party,â said Wexler. âSo he won't have any problem communicating directly with his supporters.â But carrying his message beyond that core will remain a challenge, and some options could prove problematic. Jared Kushner, Trumpâs son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, stopped an effort to sign the president up on right-wing social media platforms like Gab and Parler after Twitter suspended his account last week, according to three people familiar with the matter. Parler was taken offline by Amazon Web Services for promoting violence in the wake of the Capitol riot and was also previously dropped by the Google and Apple app stores. Wexler said fringier platforms like Gab and Parler wouldnât reach a broader audience the way his Twitter account did. And their echo chamber of like-minded users may bore him. âHe won't get the thrill of fighting with Democrats,â said Wexler. Raising money online could also be a problem going forward for a president who raised $1.6 billion in his bid for a second term, including $167.6 million that came in after the election as he trumpeted false claims of widespread fraud. Payment processors PayPal, Square and Stripe have joined the social media giants in suspending accounts tied to Trump. The Trump Organization The New York real estate developer made his properties the backdrop for many of the most memorable moments of his political career. He descended Trump Towerâs escalator to announce his candidacy, defended White supremacists as âvery fine peopleâ in the lobby of the same building and held a crowded fundraiser at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club just before he was diagnosed with Covid-19. Trumpâs divisive politics have inevitably impacted his familyâs real estate, hotel and golf empire, much of which is located in New York and other Democratic-leaning states. In a move that reportedly âguttedâ the president, his Bedminster club was stripped of the 2022 PGA Championship in the wake of the Capitol riot, with the golf body saying that holding the prestigious event at the Trump course would be âdetrimentalâ to its brand. The PGA stuck with him longer than most. Palm Beach charity balls and social events fled Mar-a-Lago en masse after his Charlottesville remarks, and several hotels and condo buildings have exited Trump management contracts in recent years, removing the presidentâs name from their exteriors and awnings in the process. Trump properties have also inevitably been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic along with the rest of the real estate, tourism and leisure sectors. In New York, office vacancies are rising, retail is decimated and residential rents are falling. It all couldnât come at a worse time for Trump, whose company carries $1 billion of debt, much of which he's personally liable for. Though his assets would cover that, recriminations from the Capitol riot will make refinancing a challenge. Deutsche Bank, which holds much of his debt and was the last large bank willing to do business with him, has now declared it will no longer do so, and smaller Signature Bank, on whose board Trumpâs daughter Ivanka once sat, twisted the knife by declaring the president persona non grata and closing his accounts. Even selling his assets to raise cash will be harder, as brokerage giants like Cushman & Wakefield and JLL have cut ties with him. Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, didn't respond to requests for comment about the state of the business and its prospects. One potential silver lining for Trump is that being president has made him even more famous than before overseas, and he may find more business opportunities in markets like Brazil, Turkey, the Philippines and India, where he retains some popularity and whose authoritarian leaders he courted while in office. His administration also developed close ties in the United Arab Emirates, where heâs previously done business, and Saudi Arabia, where his company considered projects prior to his ascent to the presidency. Hussain Sajwani, chairman of Dubaiâs DAMAC Properties, which has partnered with Trump on two golf courses in the emirate, said heâd welcome the chance to expand his firmâs relationship with Trump. âWe have a great relationship with the Trump Organization and, be assured, we have absolutely no intention to cancel our agreement,â he said. MediaWith a love for the limelight, Trump is expected to pursue media opportunities of some kind, whether a book deal, a lucrative role at a news channel or his own media venture. Rumors of Trump discussing an âApprenticeâ revival with show creator Mark Burnett have cropped up periodically during his time in office. In November 2019, Trump took to Twitter to deny a Daily Beast report that such talks had taken place, though he allowed that it would be âa big show.â It would be unsurprising if Trump did seek to revive the show â according to the New York Times investigative report that revealed his tax information in September 2020, âThe Apprenticeâ ultimately made him $427 million, a windfall that turned his business fortunes around. With Trump now anathema to a large part of his former audience, a return to network TV is high unlikely, though former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg says the idea shouldnât be ruled out. âDonald Trump is a money-making commodity in media,â Nunberg said. âThere will always be a space for him. He will always have a tremendous audience. Even people who hate him will watch him.â Conservative media seems a surer bet, though the messy aftermath of the election has scrambled that landscape as well. Fox Newsâ early call of Arizona and subsequently the election for Biden was seen as a stark betrayal by Trump, who began railing against Rupert Murdochâs conservative news giant and urging his supporters to switch to upstart rivals like Newsmax and One America News Network that more freely repeated his baseless claims of election fraud. But those channels still reach far fewer viewers than Fox, and there have been calls for cable operators like AT&T and Comcast to drop them in the wake of the Capitol riots. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Hicks Equity Partners, an investment firm associated with RNC Vice Chair Tommy Hicks, the son of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst founder Tom Hicks, has tried to raise money to help fund a right-leaning outlet to compete with Fox News. Many doubt the former president would be able to raise the kind of money needed to create a credible alternative to Fox. Politico media columnist Jack Shafer dismissed the idea of a Trump network last week, noting that the former president would have a hard time convincing cable companies to carry his channel, face withering competition from a once-friendly Fox and struggle to attract advertisers besides MyPillow. Even just getting a book published might be tough. The Obamas got a combined $65 million advance for their memoirs, and Trump would no doubt love to best that figure. If he does though, it might not be with a mainstream publishing house. Simon & Schuster, which is being bought by Bertelsmann SE, recently canceled plans to publish a book by Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who sought to challenge Bidenâs election win and was photographed raising his fist to salute the Capitol protesters. But Nunberg said Trump is in a whole different category from Hawley. âSimon & Schuster would love to publish a Donald Trump book,â Nunberg said. âThat book will sell more than Obamaâs. And it wouldnât be 700 pages.â RetailTrump has long loved to slap his name on things, buildings for sure but also adult-education courses, vodka (though he doesnât drink) and mail-order steaks (he eats his well-done, with ketchup). This trait appears to run in the family â before her father became president, Ivanka Trump built a fashion label that sold clothes, shoes and handbags at retailers like Lord & Taylor and Bloomingdaleâs. But, as far as mainstream customers go, that ship likely sailed a long time ago. âThe brand is irreparably stained,â said New York public relations executive Dorothy Crenshaw. The partners and retail ecosystem Donald Trump would need to get his products on the market wonât want to have anything to do with him now, she said. âI really donât see any viability.â Trump-branded items were dropped from Macyâs and other retailers soon after he launched his campaign with a speech promising to build a border wall to keep out ârapistsâ from Mexico. Ivankaâs partners started pulling her merchandise in 2017 after she took an advisory role in her fatherâs administration, with Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Hudsonâs Bay all dropping her label entirely. She shut down her fashion business in 2018, and now her clothes can only be found secondhand at resellers such as thredUP or auction sites like eBay. As in other areas, any future Trump retail enterprise will likely be geared towards the presidentâs conservative base. But even maintaining the site selling Make America Great Again caps and mugs is proving difficult. E-commerce platform Shopifyâs decision to cut ties with Trump briefly complicated online sales, although the site began operating again over the weekend. Though the family hasnât declared any intention of expanding their consumer-facing businesses, the Trumps still hold live trademarks for products ranging from infant beddings to coffee to greeting cards. And Ivanka may find new markets for her wares abroad â the Chinese government awarded her dozens of trademarks during her fatherâs time in office, many of which seemed suspiciously timed with Trump administration foreign policy decisions, watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has pointed out. Legal ExposureOf course, none of that will matter if Trump is behind bars. He was already facing a number of legal threats that pre-date the election. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team detailed several instances in which the president may have obstructed justice, and Trump was also potentially implicated in the campaign finance case that resulted in a three-year sentence for his former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. Justice Department policy has shielded Trump from federal prosecution as a sitting president, but that goes away on Wednesday, and the incoming administration could revive those cases. The revelation by the New York Times that Trump took a number of questionable deductions over the years and only paid $750 in income taxes in 2016 could also spur a fresh probe into possible tax evasion. New York state authorities have been eyeing Trump as well. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is leading a probe of the president's business dealings that could ultimately result in criminal charges. New York Attorney General Letitia James is simultaneously pursuing an investigation into whether the Trump Organization inflated asset values. Trump's personal conduct is also at issue in a number of civil cases. He could soon face depositions in two New York defamation lawsuits brought by women he said were lying when they accused him of sexual assault. Since the election, Trump has only added to his potential legal woes. His shocking Jan. 2 call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which he asked the election official to âfindâ him just enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in the state, may have violated both federal and state laws against election fraud. Such a case could be bolstered by additional actions taken by Trump â telling a state investigator he would be a ânational heroâ if he uncovered fraud in the Georgia vote, as the Washington Post has reported, and forcing the resignation of the top federal prosecutor in Atlanta for failing to aggressively pursue baseless election-fraud claims, according to the Wall Street Journal. And then there's the Capitol riot. Trump gave an inflammatory speech to the crowd that then laid siege to the halls of Congress. While some legal experts say the president's exhortations may have been too vague for him to be charged with inciting the violence, any evidence that emerges of coordination between the White House and radical groups that participated in storming the Capitol could change the picture. Perhaps more importantly, widespread outrage over the riot has scrambled the political calculations behind bringing any case against Trump. Where the Biden administration may have once preferred to move on, it may now face growing calls to hold a former President Trump accountable in one way or another. "
"NEW YORK: President Trump urged a federal appeals court to rule that he qualifies as a government employee under a law that would let him dodge a defamation suit by E Jean Carroll, a columnist who claims he raped her two decades ago. Trump on Friday asked the court to reverse a district judgeâs finding from October that presidents arenât covered by the Westfall Act of 1988, which protects government workers from being personally sued for actions related to their official duties. "
"WASHINGTON: When a US appeals court declared that Florida could make it harder for convicted felons to vote - a ruling decried by civil rights activists - the impact of President Donald Trump's conservative judicial appointments was plain to see. The Atlanta-based 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals was divided 6-4 in the September ruling, with five Trump appointees in the majority. They ruled that the Republican-governed state could require felons to pay fines, restitution and legal fees after serving time and before casting ballots. A lower court had ruled the law violated their voting rights under the US Constitution. The dissenting 11th Circuit judges were all Democratic appointees. The outcome illustrated that Trump's success in moving the US judiciary to the right was not limited to the Republican president's three Supreme Court appointments - Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch - who pushed the top US judicial body's conservative majority to 6-3. Nowhere is that more clearly on display than on the 13 influential federal courts of appeals, one rung below the Supreme Court. Trump, due to leave office next Wednesday, has appointed 54 judges to these courts in his four years as president, just one fewer than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama did in eight years. Trump's total amounts to almost a third of the 179 federal appellate judges. Trump also appointed 174 federal district court judges, a step below the appeals courts. Only Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who served from 1977 to 1981, appointed more judges overall during a single four-year term, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar who tracks judicial nominations. Earlier in his presidency, Trump often touted judicial appointments as one of his greatest achievements in office. But after losing the Nov. 3 presidential election, he turned on judges, including Supreme Court justices, who repeatedly rejected his efforts to overturn the result as he pushed false claims of widespread voting fraud and irregularities. ""He misses the fundamentals, much less the subtleties, of the independent judiciary,"" Wheeler said. ""Those concepts are just foreign to him."" When Trump took office in January 2017, the 11th Circuit had an 8-3 majority of Democratic-appointed judges. Due to the speed of Trump's nominations and the quick work that the Republican-led Senate under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made of confirming them, it now has a 7-5 majority of Republican appointees. The number of Republican and Democratic appointees is typically an indicator of an appeals court's conservative-liberal balance. Trump's nominees have generally been relatively young, meaning they could serve in their lifetime appointments potentially for decades. Trump appointed eight non-white judges and 11 women to these appeals courts, including Barrett, who he subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court. Although Supreme Court rulings have the greatest impact on the law, it hears fewer than 100 cases a year, typically leaving the final word to the 13 appeals courts. Trump's judicial appointees already are having an influence not just on voting rights but on other contentious issues including guns, abortion and LGBT rights. 'TIPPED THE BALANCE' ""Having such a very high number of ideologically driven young courts of appeal judges around the country not only tipped the balance on a number of these circuits but has also tipped it in a way that could last for a long time,"" said Russ Feingold, a former Democratic US senator and president of the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal group. When Trump took office, Democratic-appointed judges held majorities on nine of the 13 appeals courts. Under Trump, the 11th Circuit and two other regional appeals courts - the New York-based 2nd Circuit and the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit - have ""flipped"" to have a majority of Republican appointees. Even on courts that have not flipped, Republican-appointed judges have made inroads. At the start of Trump's presidency, the liberal San Francisco-based 9th Circuit had an 18-4 majority of Democratic appointees. Now it is just 16-13. Trump-appointed judges have made their mark on the 9th Circuit, including when Judge Kenneth Lee authored a ruling last August striking down a California gun regulation that banned large-capacity magazines. On abortion, four Trump-appointed judges were in the majority in 2019 when the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit declined to reconsider a ruling that upheld a Republican-backed Louisiana law that placed restrictions on doctors who perform abortions. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling last June struck down the law. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but supporters of Trump's judges said their rulings have shown independence from political influence. ""So many of these court of appeals judges ... have proven over and over that they put the rule of law and the Constitution ahead of any political agenda. Democrats predicted that they would be political hacks, but theyâve been proven wrong,"" said Leonard Leo, a long-time conservative legal activist who advised the Trump administration on judges. McConnell played a crucial role in clearing the way for Trump's appointments by impeding Senate confirmation of Obama's picks - including refusing to consider Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court in 2016 - while subsequently speeding approval of Trump's nominees. In some ways, Wheeler said, ""it's McConnell's legacy: He gave Trump the vacancies to fill."" "
"NEW YORK: President Donald Trump's former personal doctor -- who claimed Trump had dictated a letter insisting he would be the ""healthiest"" president ever -- has died, reports said Thursday. Harold Bornstein passed away last Friday at the age of 73, according to the New York Times. No cause of death was given. The long-haired gastroenterologist was Trump's physician from 1980 to 2017. Bornstein gained public attention in December 2015 when Trump's presidential campaign team released a letter from him gushing about Trump's apparently excellent health. The glowing missive said that ""if elected, Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."" The New York doctor told CNN in 2018 that the president had ""dictated the whole letter"" himself. ""I didn't write that letter. I just made it up as I went along,"" Bornstein said. The eccentric Manhattan doctor had previously said he wrote the note hastily as Trump's car waited. Bornstein had hoped to follow Trump to the White House but his hopes were dashed after he told the New York Times that Trump was taking a drug to promote hair growth. Bornstein told NBC News that after the Times article appeared a bodyguard visited his Park Avenue office and confiscated the president's medical records. ""They must have been here for 25 or 30 minutes. It created a lot of chaos,"" Bornstein said, adding that the February 2017 incident made him feel ""raped, frightened and sad."" "
"WASHINGTON: The Grand Old Party is done with pro-Trump MAGA extremists. The Republican Party is splitting into a moderate establishment wing and a virulent Trump faction. This became clear on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives began proceedings on Wednesday to impeach Donald Trump for a second time in an unprecedented move in US Presidential history. Democrats pushed ahead with the impeachment process after vice-president Mike Pence rejected a House resolution asking him to fire Trump by invoking the 25th amendment, which allows a majority of the cabinet to remove an incapacitated President. Live updates: Trump's impeachmentDespite Pence's repudiation of what many Republicans consider a precipitate and unnecessary move given that less than a week remains of the Trump Presidency, some GOP legislators are expected to vote for the impeachment or abstain amid mounting evidence that Trump and his extremist supporters, including some lawmakers, incited a MAGA mob into storming the US Capitol. Emboldened by the imminence of Trump's departure, the Department of Justice and the FBI is coming down on the extremists with a heavy hand. Moderate Republicans are also finding their nerve. ""The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing. None of this would have happened without the President... I will vote to impeach the President,"" Liz Cheney, the third ranking Republican in the House and one of several GOP stalwarts breaking from Trump, said. Cheney is the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, who last week initiated a letter signed for ten former defence secretaries warning the US military against becoming tools in any attempted Trump coup. Following up on that stern message, eight senior Joint Chiefs of Staff led by Gen Mark Milley issued an unusual missive to the entire American armed forces reminding them that their job is to support and defend the Constitution, and to reject extremism. âAs we have done throughout our history, the US military will obey lawful orders from civilian leadership, support civil authorities to protect lives and property, ensure public safety in accordance with the law, and remain fully committed to protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,â they said in a memo forestalling any coup attempt, amid reports of several former and current men and women in uniform joining the Trump insurgency. The GOP leadership itself is signaling it is fine with Trump's second impeachment, in part because they want to put the volatile President, who has ""hijacked"" the party, out of the 2024 Presidential race and bring the party back to moderation. Pence, himself a 2024 aspirant, rejected only the invocation of the 25th amendment on constitutional grounds, without any reference to the impeachment. Despite the White House statement claiming they had a ""good meeting"" on Tuesday, their rift is now public with Trump reportedly exploding at him in one phone call for not supporting his effort to steal the election, telling him, âYou can either go down in history as a patriot or you can go down in history as a p***y.â Who are the patriots and who are not will play out in the political arena over the next few days and weeks. In a terrifying signal for MAGA extremists, including Republican lawmakers who incited the mob, FBI and Department of Justice officials asserted on Wednesday that they are looking at âsignificant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy"" involving prison terms of up to 20 years for those involved in the storming of the Capitol. Democrats are pointing to several incendiary speeches by Trump, his sons, and their minions as evidence of incitement. One congresswoman said she saw a GOP lawmaker conducting MAGA extremists on a tour of the capital the day before the attack that some legislators said caused them to fear death at the hands of the fanatics. Ending Trump's political future will be in the hands of Republicans the US Senate. While the House impeachment will have no consequences beyond the indictment, the Senate can effectively debar him from running for office with a conviction, which requires a 2/3rd majority of those present and voting. This means that even if some GOP Senators absent themselves, if not vote for the conviction, Trump will be done in terms of another shot at the White House. However, Trump still retains some grassroots support of his so-called ""base"" and it is unlikely GOP Senators who are up for re-election in 2022 mid term polls (when a third of the Senate will be up for grabs) will vote to convict him. "
"WASHINGTON: The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives, which is rushing ahead towards impeaching Donald Trump over the unprecedented Capitol Hill attack, has passed a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. The resolution was voted by 223 to 205 votes on Tuesday night. The voting was mostly on party lines, with one Republican voting in favour of the resolution and another five abstaining. The resolution calls upon Pence to mobilise the Cabinet to activate the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. The 25th Amendment, adopted more than 50 years ago in the wake of President John F Kennedy's assassination, provides a mechanism for the succession of the president for his or her replacement in the event he or she proves unfit to serve. Under the amendment, the vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or some other body designated by Congress may remove the president from office. The vote came after Pence, a Republican, wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would not invoke the 25h Amendment. âUnder our Constitution, the 25th Amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th Amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedent,â Pence said in a letter to Pelosi, a Democrat. Speaking on the House floor, Pelosi said on January 6, President Trump incited a deadly insurrection against America that targeted the very heart of its democracy, the US Capitol. ""Defiling the genius of the Constitution, separate but equal, attacking the first branch of government, trying to prevent the US from ascertaining â the constitutional duty to ascertain that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be President and Vice President of the United States. âThe gleeful desecration they have â gleeful desecration of the Capitol and violence against the Congress, our staff and our workers are horrors that will forever stain our nation's history. Five Americans have died following the violent attack. More than 50 police officers were seriously injured, including fifteen officers who were hospitalised,â Pelosi said. She said the ""facts are very clear"" that the President called for the seditious attack. ""For days, he urged supporters to come to Washington for the insurrection. Wednesday (Jan 6) morning he participated in a rally to encourage the rioters to march on the Capitol and fight. And, not only did he urge people to march on the Capitol and fight, he further fanned the flames and he and his family cheered and celebrated the desecration of the Capitol,â Pelosi said. As the dangers escalated, he ignored and flat out rejected the pleas of Congress, including those of his own party, to call off his supporters â the rioters, the terrorists â as they engaged in vandalism and violence. Later that day â and, now, the President is saying that he is not responsible and that his incitement to violence was totally appropriate, she said. Referring to the impeachment proceedings against him, Trump in a public speech on Tuesday in a Texas border town said free speech is under assault in the US like never before. ""The impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division...which is very dangerous for the USA, especially at this very tender time,"" he said. Pelosi said Trump's actions demonstrate his absolute inability to discharge the most basic and fundamental powers and duties of his office. ""Therefore, the President must be removed from office immediately. This is a decision we make with the utmost solemnity and prayerfulness, which this crisis requires. Removal of the President is an unprecedented action, but it is required because he is an â because it is an unprecedented moment in history because of the danger he poses,"" she said. The House of Representatives is expected to consider an article of impeachment against Trump on Wednesday, thus opening the possibility of Trump becoming the only president in US history to be impeached twice. The articles of impeachment charges Trump with a count of 'incitement of insurrection' for his actions on January 6, when he delivered a speech inciting his supporters to lay siege to the Capitol, an action that temporarily halted the counting of Electoral College votes and resulted in the deaths of five individuals, including a police officer. Earlier, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler released a majority staff report for the impeachment of Trump. The 50-page report made a strong case to impeach the Republican president. Trump has falsely asserted that he won the 2020 presidential election and repeatedly sought to overturn the results of the election. As his efforts failed repeatedly, he continued a parallel course of conduct that ""foreseeably resulted in the imminent lawless actions of his supporters, who attacked the Capitol and the Congress"", the report said. The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump, it said. The House on December 18, 2019 had approved the articles of impeachment against Trump, charging him of pressuring Ukraine to smear Biden, using nearly USD 400 million in military aid as leverage. However, the Republican-controlled Senate in February 2020 acquitted him of the two charges -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. "
"WASHINGTON: The House is expected to impeach President Donald Trump for his encouragement of supporters who stormed the US Capitol, a vote that would make him the first American president to be impeached twice. While the previous three impeachments - those of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Trump - took months before a final vote, including investigations and hearings, this time it will have only taken a week. After the rioting at the Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ""we must take action,"" and Democrats - and some Republicans - share her view ahead of Wednesday's vote. For now, the Republican-led Senate is not expected to hold a trial and vote on whether to convict Trump before Democrat Joe Biden is sworn in as president Jan. 20. Still, Democrats feel that action by the House would send an important message to the country. A look at what will happen as the House moves closer to impeaching Trump in his last week in office: The basics of impeachmentIn normal order, there would be an impeachment investigation and the evidence would be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which would hold hearings, draft articles and send them to the full House. That's what happened in 2019, when the House impeached Trump over his dealings with the president of Ukraine. It took three months. This time, with so few days to act - and a feeling among Democrats that there is little need to investigate what happened, since most members of Congress heard Trump speak to his supporters and were in the Capitol when the mob broke in - impeachment is going straight to the House floor for a vote, which would come as soon as Wednesday. Once the House votes to impeach, the articles and evidence would be sent to the Senate, where a trial would be held and there would be final votes to convict or acquit. That's what the Senate did in early February of last year after Trump was impeached the first time. The ArticlesDemocrats will begin debate Wednesday on a single impeachment charge: ""incitement of insurrection."" ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" reads the four-page impeachment article, which was introduced by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland. ""He will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,"" it reads. The article says the behavior is consistent with Trump's prior efforts to ""subvert and obstruct"" the results of the election and references his recent call with the Georgia secretary of state, in which he said he wanted him to find him more votes after losing the state to Biden. Trump has falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in the election, and the baseless claims have been repeatedly echoed by congressional Republicans and the insurgents who descended on the Capitol. Just before the riots, Trump spoke to the supporters near the White House and encouraged them to ""fight like hell."" As the protesters broke in, both chambers were debating GOP challenges to the electoral vote count in Arizona as part of the process for certifying Biden's election win. Republican supportOn Tuesday, five Republicans said they would support impeachment. No Republicans supported Trump's first impeachment in 2019. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House and the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said she would vote to impeach Trump because ""there has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution."" Cheney said Trump ""summoned"" the mob that attacked the Capitol last week, ""assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack."" New York Rep. John Katko was the first Republican to say he'd vote to impeach. A former federal prosecutor, he said he did not make the decision lightly. ""To allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy,"" Katko said. ""I cannot sit by without taking action."" Also saying they would vote for impeachment were Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Fred Upton of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington. Sending to the SenateOnce the House passes the articles, Pelosi can decide when she sends them to the Senate. Under the current schedule, the Senate is not set to resume full sessions until January 19, which is the day before Biden's inauguration. Some Democrats suggested Pelosi might wait to send the articles and allow Biden to begin his term without impeachment hanging over him. But many other Democrats have urged Pelosi to move immediately. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who will be in charge once Biden is sworn in, suggested in a letter to colleagues Tuesday the chamber might divide its time between confirming Biden's nominees, approving COVID relief and conducting the trial. If the trial isn't held until Trump is already out of office, it could still have the effect of preventing him from running for president again. Biden has said it's important to ensure that the ""folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage - that they be held accountable."" Senate politicsIt's unlikely, for now, that enough Republicans would vote to convict, since two-thirds of the Senate is needed. Yet some Republicans have told Trump to resign, including Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, and few are defending him. Republican Senator Ben Sasse has said he would take a look at what the House approves, but stopped short of committing to support it. Other Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, long a key ally of the president, has been critical of his behavior in inciting the riots but said impeachment ""will do far more harm than good."" Only one Republican voted to convict Trump last year - Utah Senator Mitt Romney. What impeachment would meanDemocrats say they have to move forward, even if the Senate doesn't convict. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted on Friday that some people might ask why they would try to impeach a president with only a few days left in office. ""The answer: Precedent,"" he said. ""It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the US government."" "
"WASHINGTON: The United States called off last-minute trips by top envoys to its allies in Europe and Taiwan on Tuesday in a sudden diplomatic volte-face during the chaotic swansong days of the Trump administration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been due to make a final official visit to Europe while Kelly Clark, Washington's UN envoy, was set to land in Taiwan on Wednesday afternoon. But the visits were suddenly scrapped a week before Democrat Joe Biden takes office and as President Donald Trump faces an all-but-certain second impeachment on a charge of inciting his supporters to storm Congress last week. The U-turn encapsulates the turbulent transition period that has enveloped Washington since Biden's November election victory. But it also allows both Europe and Taiwan to dodge hosting what could have been potentially awkward delegations by an outgoing administration. ""It was very late in the game to be having a visit of this level,"" Maggie Lewis, an analyst at Seton Hall Law school who is based in Taiwan, told AFP. ""It's appropriate to be focusing on the incoming administration instead of the final days of the Trump administration."" The canceled trips round off four tumultuous years of foreign policy under Trump that tested Washington's traditional allies in both Europe and Asia. The two-day stay in Europe would have been Pompeo's last foreign trip but the State Department announced he was staying to ensure a ""smooth and orderly"" transition. The trip was already looking of limited diplomatic value with Pompeo not scheduled to meet any top EU officials in Brussels. In Luxembourg, an official told AFP on condition of anonymity that one leg of Pompeo's trip was canceled after Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn called Trump a ""criminal"" in comments to RTL radio. Asselborn described Trump as a ""political pyromaniac who must be brought before a court"" over last week's attack on the US Capitol by his supporters. Pompeo has remained staunchly loyal to Trump despite resignations from a string of his cabinet colleagues and calls to force the president from office over the attack on the Capitol. Craft's planned visit to Taiwan came at an acutely perilous time for the self-ruled democracy. Authoritarian China regards Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to seize it one day, if necessary by force. Beijing's saber-rattling has reached new heights with Chinese jets making a record 380 incursions into Taiwan's defense zone last year to signal anger over Washington's burgeoning relationship with Taipei during the Trump years. The stakes are high. A wrong move in the Taiwan Strait could spark conflict between two economic, nuclear-armed superpowers, something the Biden administration will need to grapple with. The US switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979 but it remains Taipei's leading unofficial ally and is bound by Congress to sell the island weapons to defend itself. As Trump feuded with China on a host of issues, from the coronavirus to trade and national security, Taipei became a way to poke Beijing in the eye. During his tenure, Trump signed off on some $18 billion in big-ticket arms deals for Taiwan and ramped up the frequency of official visits, including sending a cabinet official last year, the highest-level delegation since 1979. Then on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared he was lifting ""complex internal restrictions"" limiting official contacts with Taiwan. Beijing promptly warned Washington would ""receive a resolute counterstrike from China"" over the move and ""pay a heavy price"" if Craft visited. Protecting Taiwan, one of Asia's most progressive democracies, from a Chinese invasion has become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington. But Biden, who favors a far less confrontational diplomatic style that Trump, has given few details on what his Taiwan policy might be. Bonnie Glaser, an expert on Taiwan and China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Taipei would be ""disappointed, but also somewhat relieved"" by Craft's last-minute cancellation. ""Taiwan doesn't want to create friction with the incoming administration,"" she told AFP. "
"WASHINGTON: US Vice President Mike Pence told House leaders Tuesday he does not support invoking the 25th Amendment process to remove Donald Trump, all but guaranteeing an impeachment vote against the besieged president. ""With just eight days left in the President's term, you and the Democratic Caucus are demanding that the Cabinet and I invoke the 25th Amendment,"" Pence wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, referring to the process that would declare Trump unable to fulfill his duties and install Pence as acting president for the remainder of the term. ""I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our Constitution,"" he said. Democrats mobilized rapidly to begin the process to have Trump removed after he encouraged his supporters last Wednesday to ""march"" to the US Capitol and ""fight."" In a violent insurrection, the rioters stormed past outnumbered police, rampaged through and ransacked the building, and interrupted Congress as it was certifying Joe Biden's election victory. Pence, who was presiding over the vote, as well as Pelosi and other lawmakers, were forced to take shelter. Five people died during the unrest including a US Capitol Police officer. The vice president's letter came just hours before the House of Representatives was to vote on a resolution that calls on Pence to initiate the 25th Amendment process and ""declare what is obvious to a horrified nation: that the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office."" Pelosi has said Pence's failure to trigger that process would lead to a Trump impeachment vote on Wednesday. She has described Trump as being ""unhinged."" But Pence told Pelosi that her call for invoking the 25th Amendment was misplaced, saying it was designed to ""address presidential incapacity or disability,"" not as a ""means of punishment or usurpation."" He also pointed out that despite intense pressure from within his party to invalidate the electoral votes from swing states won by Biden, he fulfilled his consitutional duty to certify the results. ""I will not now yield to efforts in the House of Representatives to play political games at a time so serious in the life of our nation,"" he wrote. Earlier in the day Trump said the 25th Amendment was of ""zero risk"" to him. "
"WASHINGTON: Poised to impeach, the House sped ahead Monday with plans to oust President Donald Trump from office, warning he is a threat to democracy and pushing the vice president and Cabinet to act even more quickly in an extraordinary effort to remove Trump in the final days of his presidency. Trump faces a single charge -- ""incitement of insurrection"" - after the deadly Capitol riot in an impeachment resolution that the House will begin debating Wednesday. At the same time, the FBI warned ominously on Monday of potential armed protests in Washington and many states by Trump loyalists ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, Jan. 20. In a dark foreshadowing, the Washington Monument was being closed to the public amid the threats of disruption. It all adds up to stunning final moments for Trump's presidency as Democrats and a growing number of Republicans declare that he is unfit for office and could do more damage after inciting a mob that violently ransacked the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" reads the four-page impeachment bill. ""He will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,"" it reads. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is summoning lawmakers back to Washington for votes, and Democrats aren't the only ones who say Trump needs to go. A small number of House Republicans may vote to impeach him, while others at least want to vote for censure. Former GOP Speaker John Boehner said ""it's time"" for Trump to resign. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, joined GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to ""go away as soon as possible."" As security tightened, Biden said Monday he was ""not afraid"" of taking the oath of office outside _ as is traditionally done at the Capitol's west steps, one of the areas where people stormed the building. As for the rioters, Biden said, ""It is critically important that there'll be a real serious focus on holding those folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage -- that they be held accountable."" Biden said he's had conversations with senators ahead of a possible impeachment trial, which some have worried would cloud the opening days of his administration. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was exploring ways to immediately convene the Senate for the trial as soon as the House acts, though Republican leader Mitch McConnell would need to agree. The president-elect suggested splitting the Senate's time, perhaps ""go a half day on dealing with impeachment, a half day on getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package"" for more Covidrelief. As Congress briefly resumed on Monday, an uneasiness swept government. More lawmakers tested positive for COVID-19 after sheltering during the siege. And new security officials were quickly installed after the Capitol police chief and others were ousted in fallout from the attack on the iconic dome of democracy. Some GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Josh Hawley, faced public blowback for their efforts on the day of the riot trying to overturn Biden's election. Pending impeachment, Democrats called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke constitutional authority under the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office before Inauguration Day. Their House resolution was blocked by Republicans. However, the full House is to hold a roll call vote on it Tuesday, and it is expected to pass. After that, Pelosi said Pence will have 24 hours to respond. Next would be the impeachment proceedings. Pence has given no indication he is ready to proceed on a course involving the 25th Amendment and a vote by a majority of the Cabinet to oust Trump before Jan. 20. No member of the Cabinet has publicly called for Trump to be removed from office in that way. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., offered the resolution during Monday's brief session. It was blocked by Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W. Va., as other GOP lawmakers stood by him. Pelosi said the Republicans were enabling Trump's ""unhinged, unstable and deranged acts of sedition to continue. Their complicity endangers America, erodes our Democracy, and it must end."" The impeachment bill from Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and and Jerrold Nadler of New York draws from Trump's own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud. The impeachment legislation also details Trump's pressure on state officials in Georgia to ""find"" him more votes, and his White House rally ahead of the Capitol siege, in which he encouraged thousands of supporters last Wednesday to ""fight like hell"" and march to the building. The mob overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden's victory over Trump in the Electoral College. While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, Democrats and others argue he must be held accountable and prevented from holding future public office. He would be the only president twice impeached. House Democrats have been considering a strategy to delay for 100 days sending articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial, to allow Biden to focus on other priorities. There is precedent for pursuing impeachment after an official leaves office. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted. Some Republicans warn against impeachment. ""They're not only going to create bad feelings in Congress, they're really going to create tremendously bad feelings in America,"" said Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey. Still, other Republicans might be supportive. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said he would take a look at any articles that the House sent over. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent Trump critic, said he would ""vote the right way"" if the matter were put in front of him. Cicilline, leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles, tweeted Monday that ""we now have the votes to impeach,"" including 213 cosponsors and private commitments. "
"WASHINGTON: US law enforcement agencies are dragging MAGA extremists kicking and screaming out of airplanes, airports, and the rabbit holes they have crawled back into after their storming of the US Capitol, amid fears of another domestic terror attack, this time on the Biden inauguration. The crackdown on homegrown extremism follows threats by nativist militias and white supremacists to storm the capital again even as lawmakers are moving ahead with the process on Monday to impeach Donald Trump a second time after his fractured cabinet ignored Congressional demands to fire him using the 25th amendment. Authorities are reassessing security arrangements for the Biden swearing in at noon on January 20 on the steps of the US Capitol, the site of the MAGA mob attack, amid calls in some quarters to move the event indoors or to a safer location. More stunning footage and accounts are now emerging of the storming of the Capital by a blood-thirsty pro-Trump mob, leaving little doubt that they were seeking to eliminate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and vice-president Mike Pence among others. Pelosi recounted in a 60 minutes interview how her staff hid under desks for hours as rioters vandalized her office. Another lawmaker, New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said Trump and his MAGA minions must be held accountable for the attack after ""half of the House came close to DYING."" Cortez and other liberal and moderate lawmakers are now pressing for not just the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office but also for invoking the 14th Amendment to expel scores of Republican lawmakers who participated in efforts to subvert the results of the election. Many Republicans, who for four years enabled an ""unhinged"" President's most grotesque excesses, are hurriedly dissociating themselves from Trump and the MAGA (now dubbed Make America Grate Again) mob. Many MAGA extremists are being hunted down for arrest and prosecution after they brazenly boasted about their storming of the Capitol on social media, much of which is now out-of-bounds for their violent messaging now. Revolted by the MAGA excrescence, some of whom boasted of defecating in the halls of Congress, social media, civil society, law enforcement, and business and industry is putting them and their mentors out of commission. The Professional Golf Association announced it is moving its 2022 PGA Championship away from Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Hotels, banks, and other businesses that make political donations have begun cutting off money to Republican lawmakers who support the MAGA insurrection. Extremists who stormed the Capitol are being fired from their jobs (where they have one) even as the FBI and law enforcement authorities are mopping them up from airports and airplanes as they head back home. Several clips posted on social media under the hashtag #MAGATerrorists showed radicalized white MAGA stormtroopers being dragged kicking and screaming from airports, much to the relief (and in some cases rejoicing) from those who have long suffered their racism and the establishment's coddling of it. In one case, a young white man being restrained and handcuffed at an airport, shouts, ""You are treating me like a f**king Black person!"" Another woman dragged kicking and screaming from an airport yells she had four children with her. ""Hey officer, what are you going do with her kids?"" someone off camera asks. ""We got this, okay? This is not our first time arresting people with kids,"" the officer responds sharply. Several people commented on the time the Trump administration separated refugee parents from their kids and put them in cages. Others reminded those protesting that the MAGA movement should not be blamed for the actions of a few of how Trump sought to ban Muslims from coming to America for the actions of a few. With help from more than 17,000 tips and photos and footage posted online, authorities are now identifying extremists who among other acts built wooden gallows and hung a noose on it, carried zip tie handcuffs in Congress with alleged intent to take hostages and hang them, desecrated the US flag, assaulted police officers, and essayed death chants. Authorities are under pressure from some lawmakers to investigate and act against Trump, his family members, and his associates, including extremist GOP lawmakers, for inciting the mob. A prominent pro-Trump lawyer who posted ""Get the firing squad ready. Pence goes FIRST,"" on Parler (which has been banned) is on their radar, as is a pro-gun Republican Congresswoman who is alleged to have live tweeted Speaker Nancy Pelosi's location when the mob was looking for her. More than 100 pro-Trump Republican lawmakers, now dubbed the ""treason caucus"" or ""sedition caucus"" have fallen relatively quiet, like their defeated and departing President who has been denied his social media megaphone. Some moderate Republicans have come out openly against them after four years of enabling and acquiescence through silence. "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump Jr, the eldest son of US President Donald Trump, tested positive for COVID-19, his spokesperson said on Friday. Trump Jr tested positive at the start of the week and has been ""quarantining out at his cabin since the resultâ, the spokesman said. âHe has been completely asymptomatic so far and is following all medically recommended COVID-19 guidelines,"" the spokesman added. Trump Jr, 42, is the latest in the First Family to have been tested positive for coronavirus. In the middle of the election cycle, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19. Their son Barron had also tested positive. The president was also admitted to a military hospital for a few days for treatment. Trump Jr had campaigned extensively across the country in support of his father. "
"It was the table-setter for what would come, with nearly 2,000 people gathering in Washington on Tuesday evening for a âRally to Save America.â Speaker after angry speaker stoked stolen-election conspiracy theories and name-checked sworn enemies: Democrats and weak Republicans, communists and Satanists. Still, the crowd seemed a bit giddy at the prospect of helping President Donald Trump reverse the result of the election â although at times the language evoked a call to arms. As the audience thinned, groups of young men emerged in Kevlar vests and helmets, a number of them holding clubs and knives. Some were aligned with the neofascist Proud Boys; others with the Three Percenters, a far-right militia group. âWeâre not backing down anymore,â said a man with fresh stitches on his head. âThis is our country.â By Wednesday afternoon, a mob overran the nationâs Capitol as lawmakers hid in fear. Wholesale vandalism. Tear gas. Gunfire. A woman dead; an officer dead; many injured. But the insurrection failed. It had been the culmination of a sustained assault by the president and his enablers on fact-based reality, one that began long before the November election but took on a fevered urgency as the certainty of Trumpâs defeat solidified. Since losing to Joe Biden, Trump had mounted a campaign of lies that the presidency was being stolen from him and that marching on the Capitol was the last chance to stop it. To many Americans, it looked like one more feel-good rally to salve Trumpâs wounded ego, but some of his supporters heard a battle cry. Now dozens of them have been arrested. But the experience seemed to have only hardened the resolve of others. Timeline: How a pro-Trump mob stormed US CapitolCouy Griffin, 47, a Republican county commissioner from New Mexico, spoke of organizing another Capitol rally soon â one that could result in âblood running out of that buildingâ â in a video he later posted to the Facebook page of his group, Cowboys for Trump. âWe will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,â he said. âAnd Donald J. Trump, if it boils down to it.â The advance publicity for the rally had been robust. Beyond the repeated promotions in tweets by the president and his allies, the upcoming event was cheered on social media. But woven through many of the messages to stand up for Trump â and, if possible, block the congressional certification of the election â was language that flirted with aggression, even violence. For example, the term âStorm the Capitolâ was mentioned 100,000 times in the 30 days preceding January 6, according to Zignal Labs, a media insights company. Many of these mentions appeared in viral tweet threads that discussed the possible storming of the Capitol. 'Failure at the top:' After US Capitol stormed, security chiefs outIn online discussions, some followers of QAnon and militia groups explored which weapons and tools to bring. âPack a crowbar,â read one message posted on Gab, a social media refuge for the far-right. Still, the communication did not appear to result in a broadly organized plan to take action. It is also unclear if any big money or coordinated fundraising was behind the mobilization, although some Trump supporters appear to have found funds through opaque online networks to help pay for transportation to the rally. On Tuesday, a couple thousand people gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington for the âThe Rally to Save Americaâ event, permitted as âThe Rally to Revival.â The disparate interests of those attending were reflected by the speakers: well-known evangelists, alt-right celebrities (Alex Jones of Infowars) and Trump loyalists, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the self-described Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone, both of whom he had pardoned. The speakers repeatedly encouraged the attendees to see themselves as foot soldiers fighting to save the country. Americans, Flynn said, were ready to âbleedâ for freedom. At about noon Wednesday, Trump strode onto a stage set up in a park just south of the White House and for more than an hour delivered a stream of inflammatory words. He exhorted the crowd of more than 8,000 to march to the Capitol to pressure lawmakers, âbecause youâll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.â Even before he had finished speaking, people started moving east toward the Capitol. Soon word spread that Vice President Mike Pence â who would oversee the pro forma count by Congress of the electoral votes for certification â had announced he would not be complicit in the presidentâs efforts to overturn the election. âYou can imagine the emotion that ran through people when we get that word,â said Griffin, the county commissioner from New Mexico, in a video he posted on social media. âWhat do you think was going to happen?â By the time the bulk of the crowd reached the building, its leading edge had metastasized into an angry mob. A man barked into a megaphone, âKeep moving forward! Fight for Trump, fight for Trump!â People surged past a few Capitol Police officers to bang on the windows and doors. Many eyewitness accounts and videos have since emerged that convey the pandemonium as hundreds of people overwhelmed the inadequate law enforcement presence. After a few minutes, the crowd broke through and began streaming in. Some stood in awe, while others took action. All the while, members of the Oath Keepers, a self-proclaimed citizensâ militia, seemed to be standing guard â for the transgressors. American flags flapped beside âTrump 2020â flags, and people wearing âMake America Great Againâ regalia moved beside people wearing anti-Semitic slogans. Chants of âHell no, never Joeâ and âStop the stealâ broke out, as did strains of âGod Bless Americaâ and âThe Star-Spangled Banner.â Derrick Evans of West Virginia, who just two months before had been elected as a Republican state delegate, wandered the halls of the Capitol, filming himself. Amid the cheers and whoops of excitement were questions of what to do next. Some can be heard hunting for specific members of Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose office was broken into by several people. One image showed a trim man moving through the Senate chamber in full paramilitary regalia. He carried a stack of flex cuffs â the plastic restraints used by police. âOur president wants us here,â a man can be heard saying during a livestream video that showed him standing within the Capitol. âWe wait and take orders from our president.â Trump was missing in action as rioters rampaged through the halls of Congress. It would be hours before he eventually surfaced in a somewhat subdued appeal for them to leave. âWe have to have peace,â he said. âSo go home. We love you. Youâre very special.â Some of Trumpâs supporters expressed frustration, even disbelief, that the president seemed to have given up. One man wandered away from the Capitol, yelling angrily through a megaphone that Pence was a coward and now Trump had told everyone âto just go home.â Scores of those who responded to the incendiary words of the president now face a reckoning. A chief target of investigators will be whoever struck Brian Sicknick of the Capitol Police with a fire extinguisher; the 42-year-old officer died Thursday after being injured in the riot. Signs of potential future violence have already surfaced. Twitter, which terminated Trumpâs account Friday, noted that âplans for future armed protests have already begun proliferatingâ online, including âa proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17.â Private chat groups on Gab and Parler are peppered with talk of a possible âMillion Militia Marchâ on January 20 that would disrupt the presidential inauguration of Biden. âWe took the building once,â one commenter posted. âWe can take it again.â "
"CHICAGO: President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed in the final months of his presidency and without a trace of irony to have done more for Black Americans than anyone with the ""possible exception"" of Abraham Lincoln. He boasted that the African American unemployment rate dropped to record lows under his watch before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the economy. Trump heralded his administration's criminal justice overhaul for shortening mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and leading to the release of thousands of incarcerated people, mostly Black Americans. Trump also relished that he increased funding for historically black colleges and universities. But in the end, historians say Trump's legacy _ and his electoral undoing will be largely shaped by rhetoric aimed at stirring significant swaths of his white base that tugged at the long-frayed strands of race relations in America. His strategy of divisiveness was on display this past week as he urged supporters, mostly white men, to descend on the US Capitol in the name of his baseless claims of election fraud. After the pro-Trump mob stormed the hallowed halls of Congress, Trump did not immediately condemn the violence. He did not denigrate the rioters as ""THUGS"" or warn that he was prepared to greet them with ""vicious dogs'' and ""ominous weapons"" as he had threatened largely peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrators after the police killing of George Floyd this year. Instead, his initial response was a series of tepid tweets and video messages in which he asked his violent loyalists to ""go home in peace,"" let them know he felt their ""pain"" and told them he loved them. Trump was frequently explicit in using race as a cudgel. He claimed without evidence that Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president, wasn't born in the United States, has said Mexican immigrants were ""bringing crime"" and were ""rapists'' and argued there were ""very fine people on both sides"" after violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counterprotester dead. He privately questioned why the United States would accept more immigrants from Haiti and ``shithole countries'' in Africa rather than from places such as Norway. Trump even wrote in a tweet that appeared to be intended for a group of then-first-term lawmakers progressive Democrats and women of color to ``go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.'' ""Since the Black civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, there has been this kind of tacit agreement in the American political conversation that one could appeal to racial animus, but you had to do so in a particular sort of way,"" said Eddie Glaude, Jr., chairman of Princeton University's African American studies program. ``Trump made that all explicit again. He brought it to the fore. He mainstreamed certain assumptions about race that were driving our politics anyway.'' Human rights activists say that the Capitol siege was the macabre ending of a presidency that embraced white supremacist groups and extremists and fanned the flames of chaos and violence. ""This is a moment of reckoning for the United States,`` said Bob Goodfellow, interim executive director of Amnesty International USA. ``President Trump has repeatedly encouraged violence and disorder by his supporters. These are not the actions of a leader, but an instigator.'' The New York real estate tycoon rose to the presidency despite his complicated past with his hometown's Black and Latino communities. There was his refusal to apologize for harsh comments in 1989 about five Black and Latino men who as teenagers were wrongly convicted in a jogger's brutal rape in New York City's Central Park. Trump paid for newspaper advertisements back then calling for New York state to adopt the death penalty after the attack. Early in his real estate career, Trump and his father were sued by the Justice Department for violating fair housing laws by discriminating against Black applicants. The Trumps ultimately entered a consent decree but did not admit guilt. Trump's 2016 White House win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was aided by the first decline in Black voter turnout in 20 years. Since his November loss to President-elect Joe Biden, he has made unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in large urban centers such as Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia all areas with big African American electorates that proved critical to Trump's defeat. There has been no evidence of the massive fraud or gross error that Trump and his team alleged in scores of lawsuits that judges, whether appointed by Republicans, Democrats or Trump himself, systematically dismissed. Still, the Republican National Committee, in the aftermath of Trump's loss, has tried to cast the Trump era as one in which the GOP loosened the Democratic grip on Black voters. ``Because of his leadership we have changed the political map forever and Republicans have a road map on how to be competitive and victorious in nontraditional communities,'' RNC spokesman Paris Dennard said in a statement. The Rev. Marshall Hatch, a civil rights activist in Chicago, said that Trump's defeat at the polls brought a moment of relief. But Hatch said his joy quickly was eclipsed by the recognition that some 74 million Americans were OK voting for Trump even though he repeatedly has played down white supremacy, vilified women of color and tried to diminish the issue of racial injustice in American policing. Hatch leads the New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago's West Garfield Park neighborhood that still has scars from the riots that followed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination more than 50 years ago. The predominantly Black neighborhood has been disproportionately affected by the toll of the coronavirus pandemic. The areas surrounding the church have among the highest infection rates in the state. Hatch's church community has lost several congregants including his older sister, Rhoda Jean Hatch to the virus. ``If these were disproportionately white people dying, it is hard to see Trump or the nation reacting the way it has in the political context,'' Hatch said. ``It is hard to reconcile that there are some 74 million Americans and a majority of white people who thought Donald Trump still deserved a second term.'' A few miles down the road on Chicago's West Side, Hatch's friend and fellow activist, the Rev. Ira Acree, said he fell into a depression early in the summer as the mood darkened in Black neighborhoods like his own after the Memorial Day police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Acree, who was recovering at home after being diagnosed with COVID-19, recalled watching on television as law enforcement officers used tear gas and riot control tactics to clear protesters from near the White House moments before Trump strode across Lafayette Square for a photo op in front of the church that had been damaged during unrest the night before. Acree's concerns grew months later after Trump refused to condemn the far-right extremist group, the Proud Boys, during a presidential debate. Acree said he was trying to remain optimistic that Trump's defeat marked a turning point for race relations, but then the riot at the Capitol dashed much of that hope. ""I'm worried that this may be only the beginning,'' Acree said. ``It's going to blow up if our better selves don't rise up and say enough is enough.'' "
"WASHINGTON: US President-elect Joe Biden has said he will introduce an immigration legislation ""immediately"" after taking office, reversing the Trump administration's policies. Biden will taken the oath of office on January 20. ""I will introduce an immigration bill immediately and have it sent to the appropriate committees to begin movement,"" he told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware on Friday. Biden was responding to a question on what his administration would do first after his inauguration on January 20. He had also previously promised an immigration overhaul within 100 days of taking office. Reversing the Trump administration's ""cruel"" immigration policies was Biden's one of the key election promises. Restricting immigration has been a focus of the Trump administration since its first days when it issued the travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, and it has continued into Trump's final year in office as the White House uses the coronavirus pandemic as cover. The Trump government hardened the immigration rules on those allowed to seek asylum in the US and advocated a merit-based immigration system to protect US workers. His administration also tried ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2017, but the Supreme Court blocked its attempt in June 2019. Biden said he will also countermand the Trump administration's orders on environmental issues. ""I will in fact, countermand the executive orders that the president has in fact initiated that are contrary to, what I think, is either his authority and/or even if it is his authority, contrary to the interest of the United States on environmental issues and a whole range of other things,"" he said. Biden had vowed to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on the first day of his presidency. The US on November 4 last year formally withdrew from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a decision originally announced by President Donald Trump in 2017. And thirdly, Biden said he will immediately move through to the most urgent need of asking the Congress to give him the financial wherewithal to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. ""To be able to move so that we have Operation Warp Speed really working. Warp Speed got the vaccine to places that were delivered but did not get them from those vials into people's arms and so it is a gigantic logistical concern of how we do that,"" he said. Biden said he is committed to get 100 million shots in people's arms in the first 100 days. ""I am committed to insisting that in all federal jurisdictions, any place I have control as president, everyone will be mandated to wear a mask interstate transportation as well as federal facilities.  ""I am committed to moving as rapidly as possible to get the vaccine to teachers and the material to children that can provide for the safe opening of our schools at the end of that--beginning at the end of that 100 days. They are the most urgent things we have to do now. Now, immediately upon getting in office,"" he said.  Biden said there is going to be multiple things and there will be other committees holding hearings on a whole range of issues on infrastructure, what they should be doing to generate a green economy.  ""But in terms of the immediate need to get done not just introduced but to get done, voted on and get the money and resources to do it turns out that the most urgent need is dealing with the virus number one and economic relief to Americans who through no fault of their own are really getting battered,"" he said. "
"NEW DELHI: Outgoing US President Donald Trump has toughened his stance towards Beijing in the final months of his presidency with a slew of measures targeting Chinese companies.  Here is an outline of moves so far, the fallout in financial markets and Chinaâs response: 1 Delisting threat  * Trump signed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act into law on December 18. It allows US authorities to remove foreign firms from stock exchanges if they fail to comply with US audit rules for three years.  * It applies to companies from any country, but can require firms to disclose any Chinese Communist Party members on their boards and is seen aimed at Chinese firms with US listings, such as Alibaba, Pinduoduo, PetroChina, Netease and JD.Com.  * Investors have been shifting their holdings in such firms out of the United States, if other listings are available. 2 Investment bans  * On November 12, Trump signed an executive order barring US investors from buying exposure to firms deemed linked to the Chinese military after November 2021.  * The list of âCommunist Chinese Military Companiesâ was mandated by a 1999 law requiring the Pentagon to compile a catalogue of companies âowned or controlledâ by the Peopleâs Liberation Army, but it was only drawn up in 2020.  * Companies such as SMIC, Chinaâs biggest chipmaker, oil company CNOOC and surveillance firm Hikvision are among the 35 on the list, but have denied military links.  * On January 6, sources told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration was considering adding tech giants Alibaba and Tencent. 3 Software bans  * On January 5, Trump signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese software applications, including Ant Groupâs popular Alipay.  * The commerce department will define which transactions will be banned within 45 days of January 5.  * In August, Trump had sought to ban some transactions with WeChat and the Chinese-owned video app TikTok, although US courts have so far blocked these plans. 4 Trade restrictions  * On December 18 the United States added dozens of Chinese firms to an âentity listâ that restricts their ability to trade with US companies.  * SMIC and drone maker SZ DJI Technology were among the additions to a list that since 2019 included Hikvision and Huawei Technologies. 5 Market reaction  * Money managers say selling of banned shares by US investors could weigh on prices in the short term, but do not see big consequences yet and say that fine print could allow them to get around some of the trade restrictions.  * Index makers FTSE Russell, S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI have removed some of the listed firms from index products, weighing on their share prices as passive investors sell.  * The New York Stock Exchange said it would delist China Mobile, China Telecom Corp and China Unicom on January 11 and index providers say they will delete them, prompting heavy share price drops.  * Tencent and Alibaba shares also fell after it was reported that the US may extend investment bans to them.  * Investors have shifted holdings of Chinese firms out of US listings, saying there is a risk that more Chinese companies could be affected.  * Elsewhere widely-held securities such as SMICâs Hong Kong shares have seen modest price pressure, while others such as Hikvision have gained in recent weeks. China's response  * China has described the US moves as wanton oppression of its companies, said they lack evidence and asked the United States to cease abusing the concept of national security.  * In response to reports of sanctions extending to Tencent or Alibaba, China said it would take necessary measures to safeguard companiesâ rights and interests.  * Hikvision has called its inclusion on the defense department list âgroundlessâ and other firms have issued similar strongly-worded statements.

"Several Trump administration officials have announced that they are resigning after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, temporarily disrupting Congress as it was certifying Joe Bidenâs Electoral College victory. The officials included those in prominent positions in the White House, and staff members who have been working in the Trump administration since the beginning of the presidentâs term in 2017. Some of the resignations came hours after President Donald Trump openly encouraged his supporters to go to the Capitol to protest what he has falsely claimed was a stolen election. The moves are being made with less than two weeks remaining in Trumpâs term. Here is a list of the administration officials who have resigned.Betsy DeVosDeVos, the education secretary, submitted a letter of resignation to Trump on Thursday, saying she would step down Friday. In the letter, DeVos called the mob that disrupted Congress as it was certifying the election results Wednesday âunconscionable for our country.â âThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,â she wrote. With her letter, DeVos became the second Cabinet member to announce plans to resign after violent protesters overwhelmed the police and stormed through the Capitol. A billionaire Republican donor, DeVos was confirmed as education secretary in February 2017 with a tiebreaking vote in the Senate from Vice President Mike Pence. Elaine ChaoChao, the transportation secretary, announced her resignation on Twitter on Thursday, becoming the first Cabinet member to do so. The unrest at the Capitol, she wrote, âdeeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.â Chao, whose resignation is effective Monday, is married to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader. Mick MulvaneyMulvaney, Trumpâs former acting chief of staff, resigned as special envoy to Northern Ireland on Wednesday night, saying he âcanât stayâ after watching the president encourage the mob that overtook the Capitol complex. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday morning, Mulvaney said he called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday night and told him: âI canât do it. I canât stay.â Mulvaney praised administration officials who defended Vice President Mike Pence, who oversaw the tallying of the votes that certified Bidenâs victory despite pressure from Trump. Mulvaney said he anticipated that there would be more resignations. âThose who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because theyâre worried the president might put someone worse in,â he said. On Wednesday afternoon, Mulvaney, who was named acting chief of staff in 2018, wrote on Twitter: âThe Presidentâs tweet is not enough. He can stop this now and needs to do exactly that. Tell these folks to go home.â Matthew PottingerPottinger has been Trumpâs deputy national security adviser since 2019. He was formerly the administrationâs Asia director on the National Security Council and was known for his on-the-ground experience in China, where he advised Trump during his meeting with President Xi Jinping in 2017. Pottinger has resigned, a person familiar with the events said Thursday. John CostelloCostello, one of the countryâs most senior cybersecurity officials, resigned Wednesday, telling associates that the violence on Capitol Hill was his âbreaking pointâ and, he hoped, âa wake-up call.â Tyler GoodspeedGoodspeed, the acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, resigned Thursday, citing Trumpâs incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol. âThe events of yesterday made my position no longer tenable,â he said in an interview, after informing the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, of his decision. Stephanie GrishamGrisham, the former White House press secretary who served as chief of staff to Melania Trump, the first lady, submitted her resignation Wednesday after the violence at the Capitol. She had worked for the Trumps since the 2016 campaign and was one of their longest-serving aides. Rickie NicetaMelania Trump chose Niceta, a former Washington event planner who helped coordinate Donald Trumpâs inaugural celebrations, as her social secretary in 2017. Niceta has said she was resigning, according to an administration official familiar with her plans who was not authorized to speak publicly. Sarah MatthewsMatthews, a deputy White House press secretary, submitted her resignation Wednesday, saying in a statement that she was âdeeply disturbed by what I saw today.â "
"WASHINGTON: The chief of the US CapitolPolice will resign, according to media reports on Thursday, a day after the federal force charged with protecting Congress was unable to keep supporters of Republican President Donald Trump from storming the building. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had called on CapitolPoliceChief Steven Sund to step down after officers in the 2,000-member force fell back as crowds advanced on Wednesday. That enabled Trump supporters angry about his election defeat to invade the halls of Congress to disrupt certification of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Other officers fought to keep lawmakers and staff safe. The CapitolPolice did not immediately respond to inquiries about the reports of Sund's resignation. CNN reported on Thursday that a CapitolPolice officer had died following the riot, the fifth person to die in the incident. Washington's federal prosecutor said he would charge any CapitolPolice officers found to be complicit in allowing protesters into the building, and lawmakers vowed to open an investigation into the department. ""Many of our CapitolPolice just acted so bravely and with such concern for the staff, the members, for the Capitol ... and they deserve our gratitude. But there was a failure at the top of the CapitolPolice,"" said Pelosi, a Democrat, in calling for Sund's resignation. She said that Paul Irving, the House sergeant at arms, would resign. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said he would fire Michael Stenger, the Senate sergeant at arms, as soon as runoff elections in Georgia for two seats are certified and Democrats control the Senate. Trump supporters ransacked legislators' offices, stole computers and documents, and left threatening messages as they roamed the building for hours in a rampage that left four people dead: one shot by police and three who died of medical emergencies. The crowd racing through the building - with Trump flags and his signature red hats - stood in sharp contrast to the response to anti-racism protests this summer. At that time, the White House was surrounded by multiple blocks of buffer, and law enforcement officers used tear gas, projectiles and at one point the downward blast of a helicopter rotor to push back protesters. In comparison, the streets around the Capitol were open on Wednesday morning, and scatterings of CapitolPolice stood at low metal barriers resembling bicycle racks. District of Columbia Councilman Charles Allen, who represents the area around Capitol Hill, called that contrast particularly jarring. ""They were overrun and, in many cases, appear to have completely opened the gates, snapped selfies,"" Allen said. ""By the time they called D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, it was too late."" A House Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the investigation would focus on what intelligence was available in the run-up to the riot, how decisions were made and why the perimeter of the Capitol was not more secure. The aide said some protesters were found carrying zip ties. Those heavy-duty plastic ties are often used to handcuff people, and could indicate an intent to kidnap members of Congress. ""Taxpayers deserve to know why ... it took only an hour for a handful of ragamuffin protesters to enter the building and pose a threat to the continuity of democracy,"" Senator Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the Senate subcommittee overseeing the CapitolPolice, told reporters. 'WHY ARE THEY NOT COMING?' Pelosi joined dozens of House members in the safe room where they sheltered after protesters battered the doors of their chamber on Wednesday, and told them she had received a steady stream of calls asking why reinforcements had not been dispatched more quickly. ""Why are they not coming now? Almost a constant flow of calls,"" Pelosi said. ""That is something to review."" Pelosi and other lawmakers also praised the CapitolPolice for protecting their staff and journalists. Many officers were injured. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell called the breach a ""shocking failure."" CapitolPolice did not respond to inquiries about why they had not cordoned off the area or brought in more support officers ahead of the protests, which Trump himself urged to be ""wild."" The acting US attorney for Washington, Michael Sherwin, told a news briefing that any CapitolPolice officer found complicit in the breach of the building would be charged. Sherwin declined to answer a question about why CapitolPolice did not detain people as soon as they attempted to get into the building. ""That's a concern and that's made our job difficult,"" he said. The FBI sought the public's help in identifying the rioters. Some of the 68 people arrested after Wednesday's incidents were due in court on Thursday. On Thursday, crews installed 7foot (2-m ) fencing around the Capitol. Police said they had been instructed not to talk to reporters. Prior to reports of his resignation, Sund in a statement said the officer who fatally shot Ashli Babbitt, who was among a group of Trump supporters trying to force their way into the House chamber, was on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. Sund said his officers ""responded valiantly"" when demonstrators attacked them with ""metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants and took up other weapons."" They also faced two pipe bombs. A senior administration official said the CapitolPolice had rejected Defense Department offers of additional training from before Wednesday. ""There was concern about having too much of a militarized presence, but this was about training and how to set up the perimeters and a layered defense, and they turned that down too,"" said the official, who requested anonymity.

"Three more lawyers representing US President Donald Trump's campaign have asked to withdraw from his lawsuit challenging the US election results in Pennsylvania, shaking up his legal team on the eve of a major court hearing. The lawyers - Linda Kerns, John Scott and Douglas Bryan Hughes - made the request in a court filing on Monday, adding that the campaign consented to their withdrawal. In a brief order on Monday night, the judge hearing the case allowed Scott and Hughes to withdraw but not Kerns. Harrisburg-based lawyer Marc Scaringi has joined the case and will be Trump's lead counsel. Scaringi and the three attorneys who sought to withdraw did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Scaringi on Monday asked the judge to postpone a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, saying he and a law partner ""need additional time to adequately prepare."" The judge quickly denied the request. Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser with the Trump campaign, said the change was routine. ""The president announced Saturday that he has asked Mayor Rudy Giuliani to lead the national legal team, along with local counsel. Our substitution of local counsel is consistent with routine managing of complex litigation,"" Ellis said in a statement. The filing did not give a reason for the change, which came days after a prominent regional law firm, Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, also withdrew from the case. In a court filing on Thursday, lawyers at Porter Wright said it had agreed that its clients - the campaign and two registered voters - ""will be best served if Porter Wright withdraws."" Kerns said in a recent court filing that she has faced a torrent of harassing emails and phone messages due to her work for the Trump campaign. A federal judge in Williamsport will hear arguments on Tuesday in the Trump campaign's lawsuit, filed on Nov. 9, which seeks to halt the state's top election official from certifying Joe Biden, a Democrat, as the winner. The Trump campaign is filing lawsuits that are ""borderline frivolous"" and will not change the election's outcome even if successful, said Bruce Green, a professor of legal ethics at Fordham Law School. ""It's doomed to fail anyway. So, does it really make a difference if another lawyer comes in? I think in most people's view, these cases are not being filed with any expectation that they'll prevail,"" Green said. "
"WASHINGTON: US Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger, first lady Melania Trump's chief of staff Stephanie Grisham and White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews have resigned following the violence at the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump. Grisham, who previously served as the White House press secretary before making way for current White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany in April, was the first to submit her resignation on Wednesday. Capitol violence: As US House was breached, a fear âweâd have to fightâ to get outâIt has been an honour to serve the country in the White House,"" Grisham said in a statement posted on Twitter. âI am very proud to have been a part of Mrs Trump's mission to help children everywhere and proud of the many accomplishments of this administration,"" Grisham said. She is the first senior White House staffer to resign. It has been an honor to serve the country in the @WhiteHouse . I am very proud to have been a part of @FLOTUSâ¦ https://t.co/DZ2YOQKPRr— Stephanie Grisham (@StephGrisham45) 1609981182000Matthews also tendered her resignation. âAs someone who worked in the halls of Congress, I was deeply disturbed by what I saw today,â she said. âI will be stepping down from my role, effective immediately. Our nation needs a peaceful transfer of power,â Matthews said. US Capitol has seen violence over 220 years, but not like thisTrump's deputy national security advisor Pottinger also resigned, officials said. According to ABC News, White House social secretary Rickie Niceta also submitted her resignation in reaction to the violent protest by Trump supporters. In an unprecedented assault on democracy in America, thousands of angry supporters of Trump stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday and clashed with police, resulting in casualties and multiple injuries and interrupting a constitutional process to affirm Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election.

"WASHINGTON: Ivanka Trump has been deposed by attorneys alleging that President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration committee misused donor funds, a new court filing reveals. The document, first reported by CNN Wednesday, notes that Ivanka Trump, the president's oldest daughter and a senior White House adviser, was interviewed Tuesday by attorneys from the Washington, DC, attorney general's office. The office has filed a lawsuit alleging waste of the nonprofit's funds, accusing the committee of making more than $1 million in improper payments to the president's Washington, DC, hotel during the week of the inauguration in 2017. As part of the suit, they have subpoenaed records from Ivanka Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Thomas Barrack Jr., a close friend of the president who chaired the inaugural committee, and others. Barrack was also deposed last month. Trump's inaugural committee spent more than $1 million to book a ballroom at the Trump International Hotel in the nation's capital as part of a scheme to ""grossly overpay"" for party space and enrich the president's own family in the process, the District of Columbia's attorney general, Karl Racine, alleges. He has accused the committee of misusing nonprofit funds and coordinating with the hotel's management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. ""District law requires nonprofits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies,"" Racine has said. ""In this case, we are seeking to recover the nonprofit funds that were improperly funneled directly to the Trump family business."" The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trump's inauguration in January 2017, but its spending has drawn continued scrutiny. Alan Garten with the Trump Organization said that ""Ms Trump's only involvement was connecting the parties and instructing the hotel to charge a `fair market rate,' which the hotel did."" "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump suffered a stinging rebuke in the US Senate on Friday when fellow Republicans joined Democrats to override a presidential veto for the first time in his tenure, pushing through a defense policy bill he opposed just weeks before he leaves office. Meeting in a rare New Year's Day session, senators voted 81-13 to secure the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto. Eight previous Trump vetoes had been upheld. The Senate also ended for now a push by Democrats to increase Covid-19 financial relief checks from $600 to $2,000, a change sought by Trump. Senator Bernie Sanders again joined Democrats in a bid to force a vote on higher payments, only to be blocked by Republicans. Republican lawmakers have largely stood by the president during his turbulent White House term. Since losing his re-election bid in November, however, Trump has lashed out at them for not fully backing his unsupported claims of voter fraud, for rejecting his demand for bigger Covid-19 relief checks, and for moving to override his veto. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Monday voted to override the veto. A president has the power to veto a bill passed by Congress, but lawmakers can uphold the bill if two-thirds of both houses vote to override the veto. The $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) determines everything from how many ships are bought to soldiers' pay and how to address geopolitical threats. Trump refused to sign it into law because it did not repeal certain legal protections for social media platforms and included a provision stripping the names of Confederate generals from military bases. ""Weâve passed this legislation 59 years in a row. And one way or another, weâre going to complete the 60th annual NDAA and pass it into law before this Congress concludes on Sunday,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had said ahead of the vote. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the president of using his final weeks in office ""to sow chaos,"" saying in a statement that Congress urged him to ""end his desperate and dangerous sabotage."" Until Friday's vote, Trump had been on track to be the first president since Lyndon Johnson with no vetoes overridden. The bill also overhauls anti-money laundering rules and banning anonymous shell companies, a victory for law enforcement and rights groups which have long sought changes to make it easier to police illicit money flows. US weak rules on disclosing corporate owners have allowed criminals to use legal entities to shuffle their cash around the world, according to the authorities. The vote could have implications for two U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will decide control of the chamber under Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. The senators facing a runoff, Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, strongly back both Trump and the military. But neither Perdue nor Loeffler voted on Friday. Neither did another staunch Trump ally, Senator Lindsey Graham. Perdue entered quarantine this week after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Spokesmen for Loeffler and Graham did not respond to requests seeking comment. The push to have Confederate names stripped from U.S. bases gained momentum after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last May, triggering months of protests over racial injustice. The legislation requires the defense secretary to establish a commission with 45 days charged with developing a plan to remove the names of Confederate soldiers and leaders from Defense Department property and to implement that plan within three years. Among the bases that would require a name change is the largest U.S. Army base, Fort Bragg in North Carolina, named for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. The bill limits Trump's ability to immediately withdraw all remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan. The measure requires Trump to submit a ""comprehensive, interagency assessment of the risks and impacts before using funds to draw down U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan below 4,000 or current levels and again before drawing down below 2,000,"" a summary says. As votes were being counted indicating Trump had lost, the president took to Twitter to tout a protest rally being planned in Washington on Wednesday, the day the new Congress officially tallies the Electoral College votes certifying Biden's presidential victory. Some Trump allies in Congress have said they plan to object on Trump's behalf, including Senator Josh Hawley who expects to be joined by as many as 140 other House Republicans. The objections are expected to be dismissed by the majority of lawmakers. Hawley acknowledged that he is still undecided about how many state election results will be the targets of his objections. Republican Senator Ben Sasse blasted the move as an effort by ambitious politicians to tap into Trump's populist base, saying on Facebook on Wednesday: ""Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government."" Trump tweeted about the Senate's refusal to take up his call for more COVID-19 relief aid and to lift legal protections for social media platforms. ""Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!! Now they want to give people ravaged by the China Virus $600, rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need. Not fair, or smart!"" he wrote. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Wednesday granted pardons to his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former adviser Roger Stone, sweeping away the most important convictions from US Special Counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. So far, Trump, who has 27 days left in the White House until President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on January 20, has issued 70 pardons since taking office. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump had talked with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about pardoning him, citing two people briefed on the matter. The Times also said that Trump has asked advisers about the possibility of âpreemptivelyâ pardoning his three eldest children - Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump. In 2018, Trump even said he had the âabsolute rightâ to pardon himself - a claim many constitutional law scholars dispute. Here is an overview of Trumpâs pardon power. CAN A PARDON BE PREEMPTIVE?Yes. Most pardons are issued to people who have been prosecuted and sentenced. But pardons can cover conduct that has not resulted in legal proceedings, though they cannot apply to future conduct. The Supreme Court said in 1866 that the pardon power âextends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.â Most famously, former President Richard Nixon was preemptively pardoned by his successor Gerald Ford in 1974 for all crimes he might have committed against the United States while he was in office. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter preemptively pardoned hundreds of thousands of âdraft dodgersâ who avoided a government-imposed obligation to serve in the Vietnam War. ARE THERE LIMITS ON A PRESIDENTâS PARDON POWER?The pardon power, which comes from the US Constitution, is one of the broadest available to a president. The nationâs founders saw the pardon power as a way to show mercy and serve the public good. The president does not have to give a reason for issuing a pardon. In a 1981 case, the Supreme Court said pardons ""are rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial review.â The pardon power, however, is not absolute. Crucially, a pardon only applies to federal crimes. COULD TRUMP PARDON HIS CHILDREN AND INNER CIRCLE?It would be legal for Trump to pardon his inner circle, including members of his family. In 2001, former President Bill Clinton pardoned his brother, Roger, who was convicted for cocaine possession in Arkansas. Clinton pardoned about 450 people, including a Democratic Party donor, Marc Rich, who had earlier fled the country because of tax evasion charges. HOW BROADLY WORDED CAN A PARDON BE?It's unclear. The pardon Nixon received from Ford was very broad, absolving Nixon for all criminal offenses he committed or may have taken part in during his presidency. The US Supreme Court has never ruled on whether such a broad pardon is lawful. Some scholars have argued the nationâs founders intended for pardons to be specific, and that there is an implied limit on their scope. WHAT WOULD TRUMP PARDON HIS CHILDREN OR GIULIANI FOR?Trumpâs children have not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing, and it is unclear what Trump would pardon them for. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who enforces New York state laws, has been conducting a criminal investigation into Trump and his family company, the Trump Organization. Vance, a Democrat, has suggested in court filings that his probe could focus on bank, tax and insurance fraud, as well as falsification of business records. It is unclear what stage the investigation is at. No one has been charged with wrongdoing. Trump, a Republican, has called the Vance probe politically motivated harassment. A presidential pardon, which can only be granted for federal crimes, would not apply to this investigation. Giulianiâs potential criminal exposure is unclear. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating his business dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing and denied that he spoke to Trump about a pardon. âNever had the discussion they falsely attribute to an anonymous source,â Giuliani said on Twitter on Dec. 1, referring to the New York Times report. CAN PARDON RECIPIENTS ""PLEAD THE FIFTH""?Under the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, individuals can decline to speak to investigators if doing so might lead to self-incrimination. If someone receives a pardon and no longer faces legal jeopardy on the federal level, it may make it more difficult for them to assert this constitutional right. However, since a presidential pardon applies only to federal crimes, pardon recipients can still lawfully refuse to cooperate if the conduct they have been pardoned for can also be prosecuted as a state crime. CAN TRUMP PARDON HIMSELF?There is not a definitive answer. No president has tried it before, so the courts have not weighed in. âWhen people ask me if a president can pardon himself, my answer is always, âWell, he can try,ââ said Brian Kalt, a constitutional law professor at Michigan State University. âThe Constitution does not provide a clear answer on this.â Many legal experts have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case. Trump could try to pardon himself preemptively to cover the possibility of prosecution for federal crimes after he leaves office. No pardon could protect him against prosecution for any crimes by a US state. For a court to rule on the pardonâs validity, a federal prosecutor would have to charge Trump with a crime and Trump would have to raise the pardon as a defense, Kalt said. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's campaign on Sunday filed a notice of appeal after a federal judge dismissed Trump's attempt to block the certification of mail-in votes in Pennsylvania.  Attorneys for the Trump's campaign, including Rudy Giuliani, submitted an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit following Judge Matthew Brann's scathing ruling on Saturday dismissing Trump's case, reported The Hill.  The District Court judge on Saturday had dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump's campaign seeking to invalidate the mail-in votes in Pennsylvania, which is a significant loss for the campaign.  Brann went on to reprimand the Trump's campaign lawyers for not presenting factual proof for seeking to invalidate so many votes in the key battleground state, reported CNN.  ""One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption, such that this court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens. That has not happened. Instead, this court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence,"" he said.  On Saturday, Trump had alleged that Brann was 'a product of Senator Pat 'No Tariffs' Toomey', and 'no friend of his and Obama'.  ""It's all a continuation of the never-ending Witch Hunt. Judge Brann, who would not even allow us to present our case or evidence, is a product of Senator Pat ""No Tariffs"" Toomey of Pennsylvania, no friend of mine, and Obama - No wonder. 900,000 Fraudulent Votes!"" he had tweeted.  ""....WILL APPEAL!"" he had said in another tweet.  Meanwhile, following the dismissal of Trump's lawsuit, Senator Toomey had stated that the President has exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result of the presidential race in Pennsylvania.  He went on to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on the election victory, calling them dedicated public servants.  Since Biden was projected the winner of the presidential elections, Trump has refused to concede defeat to Biden, making debunked allegations that the election was rigged, while his campaign has filed several lawsuits in battleground states.  Earlier, Biden had said that Trump was showing ""incredible irresponsibility"" by contesting the results of the presidential election and impeding the beginning of a transition process. "
"Leaders of the world's richest countries are promising to ensure equality in the race to vaccinate people against the coronavirus, even as US President Donald Trump stays quiet on sharing US-made vaccines with other nations. The president told his counterparts on Saturday at a virtual G20 meet that any American who wants the vaccine will be able to get it, and singled out American producers Pfizer, whose jab has been developed along with a German company, and Moderna Inc, according to officials who asked not to be named discussing the talks, which weren't open to the press. Trump praised American leadership, claiming credit for what he said was an efficient fight against the virus and success in bolstering the nation's economy. But he said nothing about granting access to American vaccines by the rest of the world. Trump's comments stand in contrast to other leaders, many of whom spoke during the meeting of the need for fair distribution of vaccines, especially to poorer nations. The summit communique - a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg and which the US as a member state will have agreed to - pledges to ""spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people, consistent with members' commitments to incentivize innovation."" It calls widespread immunisation a ""global public good."" Shortly after Trump's remarks on Saturday he left the session - while British PM Boris Johnson was speaking - and was replaced first by treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and then White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, according to officials. Some other leaders also dropped off after giving their speeches, the officials said. Trump later departed the White House for his Virginia golf course. A US official said it was standard practice for leaders to come and go during such summits, which can go for many hours. "
"WASHINGTON: The November 3 presidential election is a choice between ""the American dream and a socialist nightmare"", President Donald Trump told his supporters as hit out at his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, calling him the ""worst"" candidate in the history of US presidential politics. Trump, who represents the Republican Party, is currently trailing in the opinion polls but is fast catching up. Addressing an election rally in Tampa on Thursday, Trump said, ""This election is a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare."" The US would end up like Venezuela if Biden is voted to power, he said. ""This (the US) would be- if they (Democrats) get in -- a very, very, very large version of Venezuela,"" the president said. Trump, 77, was joined by First Lady Melania Trump, 55. Trump said as long as he is the president, America will never be a socialist country. ""This election will decide whether our children are condemned to the misery of socialism or if they're able to inherit the American dream,â he continued. âWe're going to defeat the Marxists and the socialists and the rioters and the flag burners and the left wing extremists. We're going to defeat the anarchists. With your support, we will fight for American workers,"" the president said. Hitting out at Biden, 77, Trump said he is running against the worst candidate. âI'm running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. I don't care. Win, lose, or draw, this is the worst candidate in the history,"" he said. Trump said his opponent stands with socialistic communist spirit, while he stands with the ""proud people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom"". Even though Trump is lagging behind Biden in national polls and in surveys in key swing states, the Republican leader asserted that he will win the key battleground states. âIn five days from now, we are going to win Florida and we're going to win four more years in the White House. And we're going on to win a record share of the Hispanic-American votes...We're doing incredibly all over. And this isn't based on polls. This is based on fact. This is based on votes that are coming in. But you have to get out and vote. We are creating the greatest red wave in the history of our country,â Trump said. "
"NEW YORK: President Donald Trump's administration is ending how it began, with over-the-top declarations of praise for the chief executive. But now the flattery is mixed with a sense of finality as key people in the president's orbit are beginning to turn the page and acknowledge his defeat. Trump himself keeps to the Oval Office, still fighting the Election Day results and offering scant acknowledgement of the death and suffering Americans are bearing in the darkest hours of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a week when the Electoral College made official President-elect Joe Biden's victory, Trump remained out of sight, staying late in the Oval Office and working the phones and television remote in his private dining area just steps from the Resolute Desk. While he made not one public appearance, some of those who have been his most influential allies and loyal defenders gave up the fight, letting the president down as gently as possible. Attorney General William Barr offered his resignation last Monday after weeks of tension with Trump brought about an early exit from his post. Long seen as one of Trump's most supportive Cabinet members, Barr in recent weeks and months had drawn Trump's wrath for not supporting the president's baseless claims of election fraud or for not publicly pursuing an investigation into Biden's son Hunter. But when Barr stepped aside, he did so with flowery language reminiscent of the compliments that were tossed as verbal bouquets at Trump during early Cabinet meetings. âYour record is all the more historic because you accomplished it in the face of relentless, implacable resistance,â Barr wrote in his resignation letter. Trump promptly tweeted it out, adding his own words of praise for the attorney general. In the six weeks since his defeat by Biden, Trump has been increasingly disengaged from his job. The virus has killed more than 300,000 Americans and is now claiming more than 3,000 lives a day, but the president has offered barely a word about the deaths or the development of the vaccine that could bring an end to the pandemic. At the same time, he has relentlessly tweeted conspiracy theories and false claims about the election, incorrectly insisting it was stolen from him while taking steps to undermine the Biden administration before it begins. Most Republicans went along, refusing to push Trump to stop or work with the president-elect. Many in the GOP took their cues from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refused to stand up to Trump, instead making the calculation that an outraged Republican base â and an angry president â could help produce victories in a pair of January runoff races in Georgia that will dictate control of the Senate. But this past week, even McConnell, R-Ky., bent to reality, declaring that the Electoral College âhad spokenâ and that Biden was the victor. McConnell's acknowledgement that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris had won came only after a long public recap of Trump's accomplishments on the Senate floor. McConnell spoke about Trump for nine minutes, declaring that âmany of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result.â He discussed Biden for one minute. Some more of Trump's fiercest allies also appeared to give credence, albeit briefly, to the electoral result. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a cable television appearance that Trump was in strong position for a possible 2024 campaign â a roundabout acknowledgement that he won't be president come next year. Others close to Trump also marked the looming end. His daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump began tweeted photos of moments throughout the term. His son Eric Trump and his family posed for photos just outside the Oval Office. West Wing staffers put up photos on Instagram of White House Christmas parties, and most of those pictured weren't wearing masks. Vice President Mike Pence continued his role as Trump's biggest hype man, even as the cheerleading came with a whiff of nostalgia. Pence in a ceremony Friday marked the first anniversary of the U.S. Space Force, which he framed as a major part of Trump's legacy. But with Trump largely in hiding, it fell to Pence to make a public show of meeting with those distributing the vaccine. And on Friday, he was the one who rolled up his sleeves and took a public shot in the arm as part of a campaign to convince Americans the vaccine is safe. Trump has been happy to bask in praise throughout his presidency. His Cabinet meetings at times resembled âDear Leaderâ sessions in authoritarian nations where officials gush compliments for the man in charge. The tone was set at the president's first Cabinet meeting, in June 2017, when the only subject for debate appeared to whether Trump was a great president or the greatest. With the media invited to watch, Trump extolled the achievements of his young administration, asserting that he had accomplished more than any president in his first six months â with âfew exceptions,â like President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Pence that day declared his job was âthe greatest privilege of my life.â Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was âthrilled,â Energy Secretary Rick Perry gave his âhats offâ to Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross offered thanks ""for the opportunityâ to work for the president. "
"NEW YORK: A New York police officer has been suspended for a month without pay for expressing support for US President Donald Trump while on duty, a police spokesperson told Sputnik.  ""He was engaging with someone in the street, they were kind of ... I don't know ... and he repeatedly said 'Trump 2020',"" the spokesperson explained to Sputnik on Sunday, adding ""and that's against the rules, so he got trouble.""  The New York Police Department's (NYPD) policy states that law enforcement officers are not allowed to endorse candidates while on duty.  ""He is suspended for 30 days without pay,"" the police spokesperson told Sputnik, without identifying the law enforcement officer or giving any additional details.  NYPD said on Twitter on Sunday that it was investigating the incident.  ""Suspended without pay; The police officer who is under investigation for using a department vehicle's loudspeaker for political purposes has been suspended, effective immediately,"" the NYPD said.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that law enforcement officers are not allowed to express political views while on duty.  ""Let me be clear: ANY NYPD Officer pushing ANY political agenda while on duty will face consequences. We will act fast here, and this will not be tolerated,"" de Blasio said.  The NYPD Patrol Guide prohibits law enforcement officers from expressing personal political views and opinions while on duty or in uniform. "
"WASHINGTON: Robert Reed says he will always believe the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump. The retired police officer-turned-construction worker believes fraud marred the vote, no matter how many courts rejected that claim. Still, a day after the Electoral College made Joe Biden's win official, the ardent Trump supporter from the suburbs of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was ready to move on. âI think it's pretty much over,â Reed said of Trump's ongoing quest to overturn the results of the election. âI trust the Electoral College.â For weeks, Trump has been on a mission to convince his loyal base that his victory was stolen and the contest rigged. With help from conservative media, polls show he's had considerable success. But now that the Electoral College has formalized Biden's win and Republican officials, including Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, are finally acknowledging him as president-elect, many Trump voters across the country seem to be doing the same. Interviews with voters, along with fresh surveys of Republicans, suggest their unfounded doubts about the integrity of the vote remain. But there is far less consensus on what should be done about it and whether to carry that resentment forward. For some, like Reed, the Electoral College vote was the clear end of a process. Others have vowed to continue to protest with demonstrations like the one that turned violent in Washington, D.C., over the weekend. And some said they hoped GOP leaders would press for more investigations to put the doubts Trump sowed to rest. They are people like Scott Adams, a retiree and Trump voter living in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, who said he accepts Biden's victory â but âwith reservations.â Adams said he's heard too much discussion about irregularities in the vote count on Fox News and conservative talk radio to trust the election's outcome and doesn't feel he'll ever knows the true margin of victory. (Biden won the Election College by a vote of 306 to 232.) But Adams doesn't think the election was rigged enough to change the outcome, even if he believes it was ârigged enough that it should be questioned more.â He'd like to see more investigations. Republicans across the country â from local officials to governors to Attorney General William Barr â have said repeatedly there is no evidence mass voter fraud affected the outcome. Trump and his allies brought a flurry of lawsuits, but nearly all have been dismissed by judges. The Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-nominated justices, denied requests to hear a pair of cases aimed at invalidating the outcome of the election in key battleground states. Still, coming to terms with this pile of evidence has been difficult for many Trump voters. They expressed disbelief that Trump could have lost, given the huge crowds he drew to his rallies. Some said their suspicions were heightened by the mainstream media's reluctance to air Trump's baseless claims. And they repeatedly pointed to the slower-than-usual vote count as evidence something had gone awry. âSomething's not right here,â said Reed, who lives in East Lampeter Township. The explanation is well known â in many states, an influx of mail-in ballots, overwhelmingly cast by Democrats, were tallied later than ballots cast in person. Still, Reed said he thought the courts should have spent more time investigating. âI'll always believe that it was stolen from him. I'll really never be able to have peace of mind that it wasn't,â he said. Others were less willing to go along. âI don't trust that result. I think that the election was a fraud. I think the election was stolen. I don't know how anybody could not think that. All you have to do is look at the results,â said Katherine Negrete, 55, a teacher living in Peoria, Arizona. Negrete is among those who holds out hope that Trump can win if the Supreme Court intervenes (there is no indication that will happen) or Congress chooses to accept an âalternative slateâ of Trump electors from several states. Election experts have said that scheme has no legal pathway and Republican Senate leaders have discouraged it. Still, Negrete said, âhopefully Congress will do the right thing"" and she expressed frustration with dwindling options. âI don't know what we can do about that. If we don't have the courts that stand up for us,â she said. ""If we don't have an attorney general that will stand up and say, 'This was wrong and we need to investigate it.' What are we supposed to do? Do we need to fight brother against brother? It's crazy.â Biden has vowed to bring Americans together and work across the aisle. His success on both fronts may depend on how many Republicans hold on to their election grievances. A Quinnipiac University poll from earlier this month found that 38% of registered voters, including 77% of Republicans, said they believe there was widespread fraud in the presidential election. "
"WASHINGTON: The impeachment trial of Donald Trump is more than an effort to convict the former president of inciting an insurrection. It's a chance for a public accounting and remembrance of the worst attack on the US Capitol in 200 years. In the month since the January 6 siege by a pro-Trump mob, encouraged by his call to âfight like hellâ to overturn the election, defenders of the former president say it's time to move on. Trump is long gone, ensconced at his Mar-a-Lago club, and Democrat Joe Biden is the new president in the White House. With the trial set to begin Tuesday, and a supermajority of senators unlikely to convict him on the single charge, the question arises: Why bother? Yet for many lawmakers who were witnesses, onlookers and survivors of that bloody day, it's not over. One by one, lawmakers have begun sharing personal accounts of their experiences of that harrowing afternoon. Some were in the Capitol fleeing for safety, while others watched in disbelief from adjacent offices. They tell of hiding behind doors, arming themselves with office supplies and fearing for their lives as the rioters stalked the halls, pursued political leaders and trashed the domed icon of democracy. âI never imagined what was coming,â said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., recounted in a speech on the House floor. Memory is a powerful tool, and their remembrances, alongside the impeachment proceedings, will preserve a public record of the attack for the Congressional Record. Five people died and more than 100 people have been arrested in a nationwide FBI roundup of alleged ringleaders and participants, a dragnet unlike many in recent times. While that is sufficient for some, assured the perpetrators will be brought to justice, others say the trial will force Congress, and the country, to consider accountability. Todd Shaw, an associate professor at University of South Carolina, said the founders envisioned a check on the presidency and the trial provides a moment that will demarcate whether American democracy makes a course correction and says âthings have gone too farâ â or not, he said. âWe're in a period where a lot of Americans are very aware of that question,â he said. Defenders of the former president are casting doubt over the legality of the impeachment trial, the rationale for punishing an elected official no longer in office and the political fallout of preventing him from being elected again. Even Republican critics of Trump, who watched in horror as he encouraged a rally mob outside the White House to make its way to the Capitol, have cooled their outrage with the passage of time and as the reality of Trump's enduring hold on the party takes shape. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was among those leading Trump's charge to challenge Biden's election, mocked the Senate impeachment case as a âshow trialâ and waste of time. âIt's time to move on,â he said. But Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a former prosecutor, said a trial can have a lasting effect of informing the public, regardless of the verdict or outcome. ""A public trial serves a vital purpose,"" he said. âWhat Donald Trump mobilised and emboldened and incited is an expression of domestic terrorism that the public needs to see and understand.â Several lawmakers stood before the House late Thursday and shared their remembrances: seeing the crowds gather outside the Capitol grounds and hearing the taunts, screams and glass breaking down the halls. And then âthe feeling,â as Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., put it, âof being trapped.â The House and Senate had been tallying the Electoral College vote certifying Biden's election victory when Trump, who had refused to concede, his supporters to head to the Capitol. Phillips said that, as he heard the screams inside the building, he realised a pencil was about all he had for defense. He thought about moving over to the Republican side of the House chamber âso we could blend in.â He and others believed the rioters would âspare us if they simply mistook us for Republicans.â Then, he said, he realized something â for his colleagues who are not white like he is, âblending in was not an option.â Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said the thousands of personal stories from that day, one âjust as valid and important as the other,â need to be told at a time when some are trying to minimize what happened. She herself faced detractors who criticised her account as exaggerated. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked lawmakers to consider compiling their experiences in essays. Pelosi led Democrats in impeaching Trump, the only president twice impeached, and the first in history to face trial after leaving office. âWhy bother? Why bother?â Pelosi asked. âAsk our founders why bother. Ask those who wrote the Constitution. Ask Abraham Lincoln.â Pelosi said the House impeachment managers will make their case and âwe'll see if it's going to be a Senate of courage or cowardice.â Walking into the Capitol, it's a changed place. Outside, razor wire tops tall fences surrounding an extended perimeter, even blocking off the nation's bookshelves at the Library of Congress. "
"WASHINGTON: Former President Donald Trump's historic second impeachment trial begins Tuesday, forcing the Senate to decide whether to convict him of incitement of insurrection after a violent mob of his supporters laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6. While Trump's acquittal is expected, all 100 senators will first have to sit at their desks and listen to hours of graphic testimony from House Democrats about the riots, which left five people dead. The House impeached Trump on January 13, one week after the violence. A look at the basics of the upcoming impeachment trial: HOW DOES THE TRIAL WORK?The Constitution says the House has the sole power of impeachment while the Senate has the sole power to try the individual on the charges. The person being impeached - who can be the president, the vice president or any civil officer of the United States - can be convicted by two-thirds of the senators present. The House appoints managers as prosecutors who set up on the Senate floor, along with the defendant's lawyers, to present their case. The prosecutors and Trump's defense team will have a set amount of time to make arguments, and then senators can ask questions in writing before a final vote. The chief justice of the United States normally presides over the trial of a president, but because Trump has left office, the presiding officer will be Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who is the ceremonial head of the Senate as the longest-serving member of the majority party. Once the senators reach a final vote on the impeachment charge - this time there is just one, incitement of insurrection - each lawmaker will stand up and cast their vote: guilty or not guilty. HOW LONG WILL THE TRIAL LAST?Unclear. The Senate has to agree to the rules of the trial, and party leaders are still working out the details. Trump's first impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted on charges that he abused power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate now-President Joe Biden, lasted almost three weeks. But this one is expected to be shorter, as the case is less complicated and the senators know many of the details already, having been in the Capitol during the insurrection. And while the Democrats want to ensure they have enough time to make their case, they do not want to tie up the Senate for long. The Senate cannot confirm Biden's Cabinet nominees and move forward with their legislative priorities, such as COVID-19 relief, until the trial is complete. WHY TRY TRUMP WHEN HE IS OUT OF OFFICE?Republicans and Trump's lawyers argue that the trial is unnecessary, and even unconstitutional, because Trump is no longer president and cannot be removed from office. Democrats disagree, pointing to opinions of many legal scholars and the impeachment of a former secretary of war, William Belknap, who resigned in 1876 just hours before he was impeached over a kickback scheme. While Belknap was eventually acquitted, the Senate held a full trial. And this time, the House impeached Trump while he was still president, seven days before Biden's inauguration. If Trump were convicted, the Senate could take a second vote to bar him from holding office again. Democrats feel that would be an appropriate punishment after he told the angry mob of his supporters to ""fight like hell"" to overturn his election defeat. Democrats also argue that there should not be a ""January exception"" for presidents who commit impeachable offenses just before they leave office. They say the trial is necessary not only to hold Trump properly accountable but also so they can deal with what happened and move forward. ""You cannot go forward until you have justice,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week. ""If we were not to follow up with this, we might as well remove any penalty from the Constitution of impeachment."" HOW IS THIS TRIAL DIFFERENT FROM TRUMP'S FIRST TRIAL?Trump's first trial was based on evidence uncovered over several months by the House about a private phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, as well as closed-door meetings that happened before and afterward. Democrats held a lengthy investigation and then compiled a report of their findings. In contrast, the second trial will be based almost entirely on the visceral experience of a riot that targeted the senators themselves, in the Capitol building. The insurrectionists even breached the Senate chamber, where the trial will be held. The fresh memories of January 6 could make it easier for the House impeachment managers to make their case, but it doesn't mean the outcome will be any different. Trump was acquitted in his first trial a year ago Friday with only one Republican, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, voting to convict, and there may not be many more guilty votes this time around. In a test vote January 26, only five Senate Republicans voted against an effort to dismiss the trial - an early indication that Trump is likely to be acquitted again. WHAT WILL TRUMP'S LAWYERS ARGUE?Beyond the constitutionality of the trial, Trump's lawyers say that he did not incite his supporters to violence and that he did nothing wrong. ""It is denied that President Trump ever endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government,"" they wrote in a brief for the trial. ""It is denied he threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch Government."" Trump's lawyers also say he was protected by the First Amendment to ""express his belief that the election results were suspect."" There was no widespread fraud in the election, as Trump claimed falsely over several months and again to his supporters just before the insurrection. Election officials across the country, and even former Attorney General William Barr, contradicted his claims, and dozens of legal challenges to the election put forth by Trump and his allies were dismissed. WHAT WOULD ACQUITTAL MEAN FOR TRUMP?A second impeachment acquittal by the Senate would be a victory for Trump - and would prove he retains considerable sway over his party, despite his efforts to subvert democracy and widespread condemnation from his GOP colleagues after January 6. Still, acquittal may not be the end of attempts to hold him accountable. Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, floated a censure resolution after last month's vote made clear that Trump was unlikely to be convicted. While they haven't said yet if they will push for a censure vote after the impeachment trial, Kaine said this week that ""the idea is out there on the table and it may become a useful idea down the road.""

"WASHINGTON: The US will hold China accountable for its abuses of the international system, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said as he spoke to his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi and raised with him the issue of human rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. The two leaders spoke on Friday. It was the first conversation between the top officials since President Joe Biden took office on January 20. âSecretary Blinken stressed the United States will continue to stand up for human rights and democratic values, including in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong, and pressed China to join the international community in condemning the military coup in Burma (Myanmar),â State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in a readout of the call. In recent years, China has faced severe criticism from western countries over human rights violations in Tibet and persistent reports of the mass detention of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. China has also ramped up a crackdown in Hong Kong after imposing a new law against subversion following major protests in the city. During the call, Blinken reaffirmed that the United States will work together with its allies and partners in defence of their shared values and interests to hold China accountable for its efforts to threaten stability in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait, and its undermining of the rules-based international system, Price said. ""In my call with my counterpart in Beijing,.... I made clear the US will defend our national interests, stand up for our democratic values, and hold Beijing accountable for its abuses of the international system,"" Blinken tweeted. China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. After being sworn in as the Secretary of State, Blinken has spoken over the phone with nearly 30 of his counterparts from various parts of the world. Blinken spoke with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on January 29, during which the two leaders reaffirmed the growing bilateral partnership between the two countries. "
"LOS ANGELES: Fox Corp's Fox Business Network has canceled ""Lou Dobbs Tonight,"" a weekday program hosted by the business journalist and vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, the company said on Friday. News of the cancellation came one day after Dobbs, 75, was named as a defendant in a defamation lawsuit filed by voting machine maker Smartmatic, which argued that three Fox hosts, including Dobbs, falsely accused the company of helping to rig the election against Trump. Fox said the move to end Dobbs' show had been in the works before the lawsuit as part of a revamp following the November US presidential election in which Republican Trump was defeated by Democrat Joe Biden. ""As we said in October, Fox News Media regularly considers programming changes and plans have been in place to launch new formats as appropriate post-election, including on Fox Business,"" a Fox News Media spokesperson said. ""This is part of those planned changes."" On the Smartmatic lawsuit, Fox said on Thursday the network was ""proud of our 2020 election coverage and will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court."" Dobbs, reached by text message on Friday, said he had no comment. The cancellation of Dobbs' show was first reported by the Los Angeles Times, which said the anchor was unlikely to appear on Fox channels again even though he remains under contract. Trump issued a statement praising Dobbs on Friday evening. ""Lou Dobbs is and was great,"" Trump said in an emailed statement. ""Nobody loves America more than Lou. He had a large and loyal following that will be watching closely for his next move, and that following includes me."" Dobbs' show ran at 5pm and 7pm Eastern time on Fox Business Network, and he appeared at times as a commentator on Fox News Channel. Starting Monday, the 5pm show will be called ""Fox Business Tonight,"" and be repeated at 7pm. In January, Fox announced that Larry Kudlow, a former top economic adviser to Trump, would be hosting a new weekday show on the Fox Business Network. It also launched a new opinion show at 7pm on Fox News. "
"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said on Friday that Donald Trump should not be allowed to receive classified intelligence briefings, a courtesy that historically has been granted to outgoing presidents. Asked in an interview with CBS News what he feared if Trump continued to receive the briefings, Biden said he did not want to âspeculate out loudâ but made clear he did not want Trump to continue getting them. âI just think that there is no need for him to have the intelligence briefings,â Biden said. âWhat value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?â White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this week that the issue of granting Trump intelligence briefings was âsomething that is under review.â Some Democratic lawmakers, and even some former Trump administration officials, have questioned the wisdom of allowing Trump to continue to briefed. Susan Gordon, who served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during the Trump administration from 2017 to 2019, in a Washington Post op-ed last month urged Biden to cut off Trump. âHis post-White House security profile,' as the professionals like to call it, is daunting,â Gordon wrote days after a pro-Trump mob laid siege to the US Capitol as lawmakers sought to certify his defeat in last November's election. âAny former president is by definition a target and presents some risks. But a former president Trump, even before the events of last week, might be unusually vulnerable to bad actors with ill intent.â Whether to give a past president intelligence briefings is solely the current officeholder's prerogative. Biden voiced his opposition to giving Trump access to briefings as the former Republican president's second impeachment trial is set to begin next week. Gordon also raised concerns about Trump's business entanglements. The real estate tycoon saw his business founder during his four years in Washington and is weighed down by significant debt, reportedly about USD 400 million. Trump during the campaign called his debt load a âpeanutâ and said he did not owe any money to Russia. âTrump has significant business entanglements that involve foreign entities,â Gordon wrote. âMany of these current business relationships are in parts of the world that are vulnerable to intelligence services from other nation-states.â Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, also urged Biden to cut off briefings for Trump. âThere's no circumstance in which this president should get another intelligence briefing,â Schiff said shortly before Trump ended his term last month. âI don't think he can be trusted with it now, and in the future.â "
"NEW YORK: Donald Trump has resigned from the Screen Actors Guild after the union threatened to expel him for his role in the Capitol riot in January. In a letter dated Thursday and addressed to SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris, Trump said he was resigning from the union that he had been a member of since 1989. ``I no longer wish to be associated with your union,'' wrote Trump in a letter shared by the actors guild. ``As such, this letter is to inform you of my immediate resignation from SAG-AFTRA. You have done nothing for me.`` The guild responded with a short statement: ``Thank you.`` Last month, the SAG-AFTRA board voted that there was probable cause that Trump violated its guidelines for membership by his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol siege. Trump, the guild said, had sustained ``a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members.'' Trump's case was to be weighed by a disciplinary committee. In his letter, the former president said he had no interest in such a hearing. ``Who cares?'' he wrote. ``While I'm not familiar with your work, I'm very proud of my work on movies such as `Home Alone 2,' `Zoolander' and `Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'; and television shows including `The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,' `Saturday Night Live,' and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, `The Apprentice' _ to name just a few!'' wrote Trump. ``I've also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others,`` Trump continued. On Thursday, the Screen Actors Guild announced nominees to its annual awards. Losing guild membership doesn't disqualify anyone from performing. But most major productions abide by union contracts and hire only union actors. "
"WASHINGTON: Former president Donald Trump refused Thursday to testify in his looming impeachment trial after being called by House prosecutors to give evidence, branding the process ""unconstitutional."" Trump's lawyers ridiculed the request in a letter by lead House prosecutor Jamie Raskin to answer questions over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol as a ""public relations stunt."" ""Your letter only confirms what is known to everyone: you cannot prove your allegations"" against Trump, attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen said in their reply. While the attorneys did not say whether he would testify, a senior advisor to Trump, Jason Miller, said flatly that he would not. ""The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding,"" Miller told AFP. The refusal came five days before the trial of the former US leader on one impeachment charge of ""incitement to insurrection"" opens in the US Senate. In his unprecedented second impeachment trial, Trump is accused of fomenting the attack by his supporters on the US legislature one month ago, forcing a halt to proceedings to certify opponent Joe Biden's victory in the November presidential election. Raskin had asked Trump, who has maintained without evidence that Biden won by massive fraud, to testify sometime next week, before or during the trial. He said Trump, who now lives in his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, had little excuse to avoid testifying, and could no longer claim he was too busy overseeing the country, as was the White House position when he was still president. Raskin also warned that if Trump refused, it would be considered as supportive of the evidence against him. ""If you decline this invitation, we reserve any and all rights, including the right to establish at trial that your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference regarding your actions (and inaction) on January 6, 2021,"" he added. Raskin's letter and the response set out the battle lines for the never-seen impeachment trial of a president after he has left office. The Democratic House prosecutors, or impeachment managers, say the Republican leader was ""singularly responsible"" for the Capitol attack, which left five dead. ""In a grievous betrayal of his oath of office, President Trump incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol,"" they said. But Trump's team argued in a filing Tuesday that whatever Trump said in the days and hours before the attack to encourage supporters to reject Biden's election win amounted to constitutionally protected free speech. And they declared it unconstitutional to put a former president on trial in the Senate. The January 6 attack continues to reverberate in Washington. Prosecutors have charged some 180 people in the attacks, according to a tally by the George washington University Program on extremism, and hundreds more are under investigation. The Justice Department has suggested they could build a case for seditious conspiracy by some Trump-supporting extreme right groups in the attack. In a White House rally just hours before the attack, Trump encouraged supporters to reject the election results and to ""fight like hell."" While Democrats will make such statements the focus of their case, Trump's lawyers will hone in on the question of constitutionality. That could bring about his acquittal. Conviction requires support of two-thirds of the 100 senators, who serve as judges and jury in the trial. But last week 45 of 50 Republican senators made clear in a vote they think trying an ex-president is unconstitutional. "
"On January 6, right after the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, 147 Republican lawmakers voted the way then-president Donald Trump and the rioters had demanded - to overturn his election loss, after months of Trumpâs baseless claims that the election had been stolen. A month later, the Republican party remains paralyzed by that false narrative. Fully 133 of those lawmakers, or 90%, are now declining to either endorse or repudiate Trumpâs continuing insistence that he was cheated by systemic voter fraud, according to a Reuters survey of all 147 lawmakers and a review of public statements they made to explain their votes against certifying the Electoral College results. Just two of those lawmakers told Reuters they believed the election was stolen through fraud; two others who did not respond to repeated inquiries made similar public statements previously. Ten of the 147 lawmakers told Reuters they do not believe the stolen-election narrative; they cited unrelated reasons for their failed attempt to invalidate millions of votes. The refusal by the vast majority of the 147 lawmakers to take a firm stand on the truth of Trumpâs central claim underscores the political peril they face as they struggle to appease voters on both sides of a rift in the Republican Party. Many Republican lawmakers believe they canât survive challenges in party primary elections without the votes of Trump supporters who are enraged at any suggestion that he lost a fair election to Democrat Joe Biden, Republican strategists said. The lawmakers also fear losing general elections against Democrats without the votes of more moderate Republicans and independents who are repelled by Trumpâs false fraud claims and his alleged incitement of the Capitol insurrection. The Reuters survey illuminates a semantic sleight-of-hand many Republican lawmakers have adopted to avoid taking a firm position on stolen-election claims that were discredited by judges in more than 60 lawsuits that failed to overturn the election result. Many lawmakers tried instead to thread a rhetorical needle - saying, for instance, that they would âstand withâ Trump to protect âelection integrityâ or âthe Constitutionâ - while avoiding any mention of Trumpâs debunked fraud claims, the Reuters review of their public statements reveals. Most lawmakers cited legal arguments that some statesâ expansions of mail-in or early voting during the coronavirus pandemic violated the US Constitution â a contention rejected by multiple courts in Trumpâs failed challenges to the election result. The lawmakers who declined to provide a yes-or-no answer to the Reuters survey included some of the most strident backers of Trumpâs bid to overturn the election, such as Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama. Brooks spoke at Trumpâs rally before the Capitol riots and encouraged âpatriotsâ in attendance to start âtaking down names and kicking ass.â In a Jan. 4 public statement explaining his vote to overturn the election results, Brooks railed against âthe largest voter fraud and election theft scheme in American history.â But when asked directly by Reuters if Trump lost because of fraud, Brooks avoided a clear answer. He instead relied on technical arguments involving some statesâ voting process changes, saying in a statement that Trump lost because some votes, in his view, were not âConstitution-compliantâ and âlawful.â While the vast majority of the 147 lawmakers never endorsed Trumpâs outlandish fraud allegations, their support of his bid to overturn the election played a crucial role in perpetuating the stolen-election myth that has become a central flashpoint in American politics. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll on the subject, taken January 20 and 21, shows that 61% of Republicans still believed Trump lost because of election-rigging and illegal voting. The lawmakersâ attempt to appease newly polarized camps of voters within the Republican Party âwonât flyâ with voters on either side of that divide, said Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia election official - and a Republican - who has been debunking what he called ânonsensicalâ election fraud claims since the November 3 vote. âThey were trying to have their cake and eat it, too,â he said of the lawmakers. That wonât work, Sterling said, because future voters will form their opinions on the lawmakersâ actions â their vote to overturn the election â rather than their words explaining their reasons. Both pro- and anti-Trump voters, he said, are going to see â147 people who agree with Trump that the election was stolen.â Some Republicans are fed up in the wake of the Capitol riots they believe Trump incited. In one striking example, Reuters reported this week that dozens of Republicans who worked in the administration of former President George W. Bush are leaving the party out of disgust at the failure of most elected Republicans to disown Trumpâs attempt to overturn the election. Trumpâs false fraud claims are likely to figure in his impeachment trial next week in the Senate on a charge of inciting insurrection. Democrats face the steep challenge of convincing 17 Republicans to join in convicting the former president. His lawyers, in a document laying out his defense, have signaled Trump will continue to insist in the proceedings that his stolen-election story is true. Republican strategist Alex Conant - a former aide to Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee - said Republican House members largely backed Trumpâs bid to overturn the election out of fear of angering his base of voters. But those in more moderate districts - or senators who campaign in statewide races - could pay a heavy political price for their votes against certifying the results. That dynamic was evident in the Jan. 5 losses by both Republican candidates in two U.S. Senate races in Georgia, who were perceived as strong backers of Trumpâs fraud claims. âAny race where independents are a factor, this becomes very awkward,â Conant said. âSenators are much more hesitant to go down the path of election fraud for that reason.â Most of the 147 lawmakers come from heavily Republican House districts where voters backed Trump by wide margins. But 43 of them hail from more moderate House districts where they won their general election last November by less than 20 percentage points; within that group, 20 of the lawmakers won by less than 10 points. Jason Miller, a representative for Trump, did not answer questions from Reuters about its survey results and the refusal of most of the 147 lawmakers to endorse the former presidentâs stolen-election claim. The Biden White House did not respond to requests for comment. HAWLEY, CRUZ DENY TRYING TO âOVERTURNâ ELECTION On January 6, the two houses of the US Congress held votes on whether to accept the Electoral College results from the states of Arizona and Pennsylvania, though members also questioned other statesâ elections during the debates. Congressional certification of the results, which occurs in every U.S. presidential election, has almost always been a formality in which members declare a winner after merely counting Electoral College votes previously submitted by each state, based on its popular vote. The 147 Republicans who voted to reject the two statesâ results included 139 House members - about two-thirds of the partyâs House caucus - and 8 of the 51 Republican senators serving at the time in the 100-member chamber. Reuters asked the office of every lawmaker who voted against the certification of Electoral College results a single question at the heart of the political crisis: Do you believe that Donald Trump lost the election because of voter fraud? Reporters then followed up with each office to seek a yes-or-no answer and additional comment. The vast majority - 133 - either declined to answer or did not respond to repeated inquiries. Reuters also reviewed all the lawmakersâ public statements and Twitter postings explaining their votes. For some members, Reuters also reviewed public statements and speeches at a rally Trump held just before the riot and on the floor of Congress before the vote on the election results. The two senators who led the coalition of Senate objectors - Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley - both avoided directly endorsing Trumpâs fraud claims even as they pushed for a special commission to investigate them. Both have faced backlash from corporate donors and moderate Republicans in the wake of the riots, as have many of the lawmakers who voted to reject Electoral College results. A spokesman for Cruz declined to answer the Reuters survey question or to provide additional comment. Representatives for Hawley did not respond to repeated inquiries. Hawley, outside the Capitol on January 6, raised his fist in solidarity with protesters as they demanded that the âtraitorsâ in Congress unseat Biden and install Trump. Yet after that protest devolved into a deadly riot, Hawley made no fraud claim in explaining his vote against the election results on the Senate floor. He instead focused solely on the argument that the Pennsylvania legislature in 2019 - which was then, as now, controlled by Republicans - violated the state constitution by expanding mail-in voting. Thatâs the same argument from a failed lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania Congressman Mike Kelly and other plaintiffs. The state Supreme Court called the suitâs timing âbeyond cavilâ - meaning petty - noting that plaintiffs waited until after Trump lost to object to a law the state legislature passed in 2019, with bipartisan support, and to seek the âextraordinaryâ remedy of nullifying 6.9 million votes. The US Supreme Court denied a petition to review the state court decision. Both Cruz and Hawley, echoing many other lawmakers, have said they never intended to overturn the election. âLet me be clear,â Cruz said in his speech inside the Capitol on the day of the riots. âI am not arguing for setting aside the result of this election.â Days earlier, Cruz gave a different answer when pressed on the goal of his support for the idea of appointing an investigative commission into electoral fraud. Fox News host Maria Bartiromo asked him: What happens if the commission finds fraud? âThen the results would have to be set aside,â he said, arguing that the nationâs founders gave Congress the ultimate power to determine âwhat counts as a valid vote.â âABSURDâ LEGAL ARGUMENTS After the riots, Cruz condemned Trumpâs stolen-election rhetoric as reckless even as the senator continued to defend his vote to overturn the results. Trump never proved his claims of âmassive fraudâ or that the election was âstolen everywhere,â Cruz said in his podcast, the Verdict, on January 23. âThatâs not responsible, and youâve never heard me use language like that.â Conant, the Republican strategist, said such careful and contradictory positioning may not insulate the lawmakers who voted to overturn the results from blowback in future elections. âNuance is rarely a successful message in politics,â Conant said. âWhenever politicians try to be lawyerly or have it both ways, they end up turning off more people.â In interviews and public statements, some of the 147 lawmakers now say their objections had nothing to do with voter fraud. More than 80 of them have cited one particular constitutional argument. They contend that, in battleground states Trump lost, state courts and election officials violated the U.S. Constitution by making procedural changes such as expanding mail-in voting or extending vote-counting deadlines without a vote of their state legislature. That theory was rejected by judges ruling on some of the lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies, including a federal judge in Wisconsin who said it lacked âcommon sense.â Lawrence Douglas - a legal scholar who called the argument âabsurdâ - said such procedural changes by state election officials or courts are âquite routine,â and regularly delegated by state legislatures to election administrators. Douglas, an election law specialist at Amherst College, said the passage of the Constitution cited by lawmakers - Article 2, section 1 - says only that state legislatures should determine âthe mannerâ in which electors are chosen, such as by popular vote, as happens in every U.S. state. Process changes such as extending a mail-in ballot deadline have ânothing to do with changing the way electors should be chosen,â Douglas said. HOW DEMOCRACY FAILS Only a handful of the 147 lawmakers are explicitly backing Trumpâs stolen-election claims. The two that told Reuters they believed voter fraud robbed Trump of victory are House members Paul Gosar of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Two others - House members Louie Gohmert and Ronny Jackson, both of Texas - did not respond to the Reuters survey but have explicitly claimed in other public statements that Trump lost because of voter fraud. A handful of other lawmakers have publicly alleged widespread fraud but did not claim, in their statements explaining their votes, that the alleged fraud was extensive enough to change the electionâs outcome. Greene declined an interview request. A spokesman, Nick Dyer, confirmed that she believes the election was stolen. Greene said Trump âwon by a landslideâ in one recent video and made other similar statements. Newly elected in November, Greene has taken a hail of criticism since joining Congress for her history of making allegedly anti-semitic statements and endorsing a host of outlandish conspiracy theories. The debunked theories she has embraced include QAnon, which holds that elite Democrats are part of a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles and cannibals. Gosar spokeswoman Jessica Lycos said the Arizona congressman âstrongly believesâ the election was stolen from Trump, though she added that âwe canât explain how it happened.â Gosar, she said, is convinced that statistical anomalies in Arizonaâs election data suggest that hundreds of thousands of ballots had been altered or miscounted. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, called that claim one of many âvagueâ conspiracy theories that Gosar has promoted. Such baseless claims, she said, undermine âthe foundation of our democracy.â Most of the 10 Republican lawmakers who now say they donât believe Trump lost a rigged election had previously issued relatively mild statements that avoided any direct allegation of fraud. But one of them - Rep. Madison Cawthorn, newly elected from North Carolina - made a speech at Trumpâs rally on Jan. 6, firing up the crowd to âfightâ the election result just before the storming of the Capitol. âThe Democrats - with all the fraud they have done in this election - the Republicans hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice!â Cawthorn shouted in the speech. âThey have no backbone!â Cawthorn spokesman Micah Bock told Reuters: âRep. Cawthorn cannot prove fraud.â Bock said Cawthorn instead relied on the same constitutional theory most of his colleagues cited in explaining their votes. Only Republican leaders can restore votersâ confidence in the security of US elections, and only by firmly repudiating Trumpâs fraud claims, said Nicholas Valentino, a University of Michigan political science professor. âWeâve seen in many other countries how democracy fails,â he said, âand it fails most often in this way - because electoral outcomes are not considered legitimate by the citizens themselves.â "
"WASHINGTON: A justice department official directed by the Trump administration to begin investigating election irregularities resigns in protest. Attorneys for law firms representing the defeated President in election lawsuit in Pennsylvania revolt, concerned that their work will undermine the rule of law and election results. Even Republican officials in states where Trump is disputing the results say they see no signs of significant voter fraud. Many world leaders and Republican grandees have already congratulated the Biden-Harris team for winning the election. But Donald Trump wonât concede. In what increasingly looks like a scorched earth policy, the defeated President, supported by loyal Republican lawmakers and a militant base, is piling on more lawsuits, firing dissenters, and lashing out against the ""lamestream"" media, big tech, deep state and other perceived enemies in an effort to reverse the results. ""WE ARE MAKING BIG PROGRESS. RESULTS START TO COME IN NEXT WEEK. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! WE WILL WIN!"" Trump tweeted in all caps on Tuesday, a week after Election Day, in a surprising change from his claim that he had already won the election. WE ARE MAKING BIG PROGRESS. RESULTS START TO COME IN NEXT WEEK. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1605015815000State courts have repeatedly rejected Trumpâs effort to denigrate the election process â by one count his side has lost ten cases in lower courts and won none. But lawsuits continue to be filed to stall an orderly succession due to the winning candidate and claim a win through judicial intervention. The bureaucracy has also been directed not to engage with the Biden transition team, even as some Democrats are drawing up hit lists of Trump loyalists in the government who they say should not be considered for jobs in the next administration. A group calling itself the Trump Accountability Project is saying employers considering outgoing officials ""should know there are consequences for hiring anyone who helped Trump attack American values."" But the Trump team is staring down the setbacks and warnings and digging in, raising fears that the confrontation could go out of hand. The Trump army is reported to be booking hotel rooms in Washington DC in anticipation for his inauguration for a second term, even as Democrats are trying to shame him out of the White House. But there is no sign that the President is ready to leave yet despite multiple reverses. In a public rebuke of the defeated Presidency, Richard Pilger, director of the election crimes branch of the department of justice, submitted his resignation on Monday shortly after attorney general William Barr announced that he was authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate election irregularities. Pilger, who has investigated many election issues in his 25-year career, told colleagues in an email that ""Having familiarized myself with the new policy and its ramifications, I must regretfully resign from my role as director of the election crimes branch."" Such skepticism about Trumpâs claim that there was voter fraud and electoral malpractice has come from Republican officials too. Georgiaâs Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger is among GOP officials who have earned the ire of Trump loyalists after they insisted the election process and vote counting was orderly and lawful in a state Trump has lost narrowly but whose results he is contesting. Georgia has a racist history of black voter suppression, and the stateâs two GOP Senate candidates who failed to win outright and are now locked in a run-off election on January 5 (which will decide control of Senate) are calling for Raffenspergerâs resignation, which he has rejected. Meanwhile attorneys at two law firms Porter Wright Morris and Arthur and Jones Day who have been retained by the Trump side to contest the outcome in battleground states are revolting and leaking to the media about concerns about their firms undermining the integrity of American elections. At least one lawyer is reported to have quit in protest. Trump meanwhile is lashing out against in all directions, berating everyone from his formerly favored Fox News to the Federal drug administration, and accused them of being part of the ""Deep State"" that is robbing him of what he believes is an election he has won. His own niece, Mary Trump, says it will be hard to talk to him out of his delusion and sees no easy resolution to the looming crisis in Washington DC. "
"WASHINGTON: After the US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Texas state in an attempt to turn the Presidential Election in Donald Trump's favour, the Commander in Chief expressed disappointment at the top court's refusal to challenge presidential vote results in the states of Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan over alleged electoral fraud. According to a CNN report, the court's move to dismiss the challenge is the strongest indication yet that Trump has no chance of overturning election results in court that even the justices whom he placed there have no interest in allowing his desperate legal bids to continue. Trump accused the court of lacking wisdom and courage. ""The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage,"" the incumbent President lashed out on Twitter. The Supreme Court really let us down. No Wisdom, No Courage!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1607748647000Trump wrote further, ""So, you're the President of the United States, and you just went through an election where you got more votes than any sitting President in history, by far - and purportedly lost."" The president reiterated his claim- without evidence- that the November 3 election was rigged and said that the ""fight is on"". ""You can't get ""standing"" before the Supreme Court, so you ""intervene"" with wonderful states... that, after careful study and consideration, think you got ""screwed"", something which will hurt them also. Many others likewise join the suit but, within a flash, it is thrown out and gone, without even looking at the many reasons it was brought. A Rigged Election, fight on,"" Trump said in a subsequent tweet. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, on Friday indicated that the President's legal team will continue to challenge the outcome of the presidential elections, even as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit led by Texas to overturn the vote count in four battleground states. According to Sputnik, President-elect Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson Mike Gwin said the court's decision did not come as a surprise, noting how promptly it was made. ""President-elect Biden's clear and commanding victory will be ratified by the Electoral College on Monday, and he will be sworn in on January 20th,"" Gwin said in a statement. The outcome of the November 3 US presidential election is yet to be officially announced, although all major US media have already named Biden the winner and congratulations were sent to him by a number of world leaders, Sputnik reported further.

"Emanuel Jackson, a 20-year-old Washington area man, was caught on video using a metal bat to strike the protective shields wielded by police officers as they tried to fend off rioters storming the US Capitol on January 6. Jackson, awaiting trial in federal court on assault charges, is now adopting a novel legal defense: seeking to pin the blame on Donald Trump, citing the former presidentâs remarks at a âStop the Stealâ rally shortly before the Capitol siege. Trump told the crowd to âfight like hell,â said âwe will not take it anymoreâ and repeated his false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. Trump exhorted his followers to go to the Capitol. The ensuing rampage interrupted the congressional certification of President Joe Bidenâs election victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead including a police officer. Jacksonâs lawyer, Brandi Harden, wrote in a January 22 court filing that âthe nature and circumstances of this offense must be viewed through the lens of an event inspired by the President of the United States.â The Capitol siege, Harden added, âappears to have been spontaneous and sparked by the statements made during the âStop the Stealâ rally.â Harden argued that Jackson should be released while awaiting trial. A judge on January 22 denied the request. At least six of the 170 people charged in connection with the Capitol siege have tried to shift at least some of the blame onto Trump as they defend themselves in court or in the court of public opinion. Other defendants to take this route include Jacob Chansley, who donned a horned headdress and face paint during the attack, and Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys right-wing extremist group who is accused of shattering a window in the Capitol with a stolen police shield so rioters could enter. âThe boss of the country said, âPeople of the country, come on down, let people know what you think,ââ Pezzolaâs defense lawyer, Michael Scibetta, told Reuters. âThe logical thinking was, âHe invited us down.ââ Lawyers have not yet sought dismissal of charges or acquittal during a trial based on the idea that Trump incited their clients, instead making the claim as part of efforts to spare them from pretrial detention. No defendant will be able to avoid criminal culpability by saying they were incited by Trump, said Jay Town, who served as the top federal prosecutor in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Trump administration. âIf anything, it is an admission to criminal conduct,â said Town, now the general counsel of cybersecurity firm Gray Analytics. âWhile this ineffective tactic may help with headlines, it will not help the fate of any defendant.â Trump took to a stage near the White House and exhorted supporters to âfightâ - using the word more than 20 times. Trump told the crowd that âeveryone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol.â About 50 minutes into the speech, many of them did. Trump adviser Jason Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the legal strategy of blaming the former president. Trump has called his speech âtotally appropriate.â IMPEACHMENT TRIAL The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on a charge of âincitement of insurrectionâ stemming from his Jan. 6 speech. He faces an impeachment trial next week in the Senate. Enough of his fellow Republicans in the Senate have signaled opposition to impeachment to indicate that the chamber almost certainly will fall short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict him. Democrats hope to use the trial to disqualify him from future public office. Lori Ulrich, a defense lawyer in Pennsylvania, said that her client Riley June Williams was motivated by Trumpâs remarks. Williams, 22, is accused of stealing a laptop from House Speaker Nancy Pelosiâs office during the siege. It is âregrettable that Ms. Williams took the presidentâs bait and went inside the Capitol,â Ulrich told a judge at a Jan. 21 court hearing as she argued against Williams being detained while her case proceeds. The judge released Williams to home confinement. Some legal experts said the âblame Trumpâ defense could complicate matters for defendants if they eventually plead guilty in hopes of getting a lesser sentence. Town noted that federal judges require defendants who plead guilty to accept full responsibility for their conduct. Scibetta acknowledged the limits of the effectiveness of blaming Trump. âIt would be reckless to put all your eggs in that basket,â Scibetta said. But Scibetta said Trumpâs speech helps explain how people got swept away in the riot. âThese were people acting in a way they have never acted before,â Scibetta said, âand it begs the question, âWho lit the fuse?â "
"SAN DIEGO: The Biden administration on Tuesday announced steps to address harm to thousands of families that were separated at the US-Mexico border, expanding efforts to quickly undo relentless changes to immigration policy over the last four years. President Joe Biden planned to sign orders on family separation, border security and legal immigration, bringing to nine the number of executive actions on immigration during his first two weeks in office. Details were thin, but the moves aim to reverse many of former President Donald Trump's policies to deter immigration, both legal and illegal. Alejandro Mayorkas, whose nomination as homeland security secretary awaits Senate confirmation, will lead a task force on family separation, focused largely on reuniting parents and children who remain apart. It is unclear how many, but about 5,500 children have been identified in court documents as having been separated during Trump's presidency, including about 600 whose parents have yet to be found by a court-appointed committee. The review of border security includes a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexican border cities for hearings in US immigration court. It is a step towardS fulfilling a campaign pledge to end the Remain in Mexico policy, known officially as Migrant Protection Protocols, which enrolled nearly 70,000 asylum-seekers since it began in January 2019. The White House said it will ""create a humane asylum system"" by rescinding or reconsidering Trump policies that caused ""chaos, cruelty and confusion."" It warned that it will take time, which may cause grumbling among some pro-immigration advocates. ""The situation at the border will not transform overnight, due in large part to the damage done over the last four years"", the White House said in a statement. ""But the President is committed to an approach that keeps our country safe, strong, and prosperous and that also aligns with our values."" Roberta Jacobson, a top Biden aide on border issues, asked Spanish-language media on Friday to discourage audiences from coming to the US border. ""It is not the moment,"" she said in Spanish, adding that the journey was ""very dangerous, and we are in the middle of creating a new system."" The White House will also do a ""top-to-bottom review of recent regulations, policies, and guidance that have set up barriers to our legal immigration system."" It will include a review of Trump's ""public charge rule,"" which makes it more difficult for people who use government benefits to obtain green cards. The moves demonstrate that, just as Trump remade immigration policies from the White House, Biden can undo them with the stroke of a pen - some more easily than others. On his first day in office, Biden halted work on a border wall with Mexico, lifted a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries and reversed plans to exclude people in the country illegally from the 2020 census. He also ordered efforts to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the US as children from deportation. More lasting changes must pass Congress, a daunting job that Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama and George W Bush failed to achieve. Also on his first day in office, Biden proposed legislation to give legal status and a path to citizenship to everyone in the country who doesn't have it - an estimated 11 million people. Biden promised far-reaching changes on immigration during his campaign, but it was unclear how quickly he would tackle the lightning-rod issue. His first-day actions delighted and surprised many pro-immigration advocates who are now being asked for patience. It is unclear when Biden will lift bans on many temporary work visas and green cards that took effect after the coronavirus pandemic struck or when he will stop allowing authorities to immediately expel people at the border on public health grounds without an opportunity to seek asylum. Esther Olavarria, deputy director of the White House domestic policy council for immigration, said at a US conference of mayors meeting last month that an executive order aimed at ""restoring sanity at the US-Mexico border"" would end the Remain in Mexico policy and agreements that the Trump administration struck with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for the US to reject asylum applicants and instead send them to those Central American countries with an opportunity to seek protection there. Olivarria told the mayors to expect an order that restores the US refugee resettlement program after dramatic cuts under Trump but that measure was not included in Tuesday's announcements. "
"NEW DELHI: Even after a victory speech by president-elect Joe Biden, US President Donald Trump is clinging to hopes of a favourable ruling in his legal challenge to the election results. In a barrage of tweets on Sunday, he talked about 'systemic problems' in authenticating ballots that affect the entire election. In a lengthy rant spanning four tweets (Twitter sets a limit to the length of each post), Trump alleged that US election process has a history of problems. He cited a court order ruling that a set of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania be taken up only after all other ballots are counted, and tried to imply that ballots arriving late be treated differently in all states. ...and Detroit with a long series of election problems (to put it mildly).â @JonathanTurley— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1604842702000Trump has still not conceded the election, and has said that his legal team will be in action from Monday, challenging the results. He has claimed that his victory is assured if only 'legal' ballots are counted and 'illegal' ones arriving after closure of voting be left out. States in the US have different laws on the deadline by which mail-in ballots should arrive to be counted as 'legal.' Trump has not provided evidence to the law being flouted in any state, while claiming that the election has been 'stolen' from him. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Monday threatened to reimpose sanctions on Myanmar following a coup by the country's military leaders and called for a concerted international response to press them to relinquish power. Biden condemned the military's takeover from the civilian-led government on Monday and its detention of elected leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi as ""a direct assault on the countryâs transition to democracy and the rule of law."" The Myanmar crisis marks a first major test of Biden's pledge to collaborate more with allies on international challenges, especially on China's rising influence, in contrast to former President Donald Trump's often go-it-alone ""America First"" approach. It also represented a rare policy alignment between Biden's fellow Democrats and top Republicans as they joined in denouncing the coup and urging Myanmar's military face consequences. ""The international community should come together in one voice to press the Burmese military to immediately relinquish the power they have seized, release the activists and officials they have detained,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The United States removed sanctions on Burma over the past decade based on progress toward democracy. The reversal of that progress will necessitate an immediate review of our sanction laws and authorities, followed by appropriate action,"" he said. Biden also called on the military in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, to lift all restrictions on telecommunications and to refrain from violence against civilians. He said the United States was ""taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour."" ""We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burmaâs democratic transition,"" he said. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won a landslide 83% in a Nov. 8 election. The army said in taking over in the early hours of Monday that it had responded to what it called election fraud. 'INTENSIVE' CONSULTATIONS White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a regular news briefing the United States has had ""intensive"" conversations with allies about Myanmar. She declined to say what other actions were under consideration aside from sanctions. Asked whether Bidenâs assertion that the United States was âtaking note"" of how other countries respond was a message to China, Psaki told reporters: âItâs a message to all countries in the region."" The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign relations committee, Robert Menendez, said the United States and other countries ""should impose strict economic sanctions, as well as other measures"" against Myanmar's army and the military leadership if they did not free the elected leaders and remove themselves from government. Menendez also charged that the Myanmar army was guilty of ""genocide"" against minority Rohingya Muslims - a determination yet to be stated by the US government - and of a sustained campaign of violence against other minorities. US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who like members of the Biden administration has had close past ties with Suu Kyi, called the arrests ""horrifying"" and demanded a tough response. ""The Biden Administration must take a strong stand and our partners and all democracies around the world should follow suit in condemning this authoritarian assault on democracy,"" he said. McConnell added that Washington needed to ""impose costs"" on those behind the coup. The events in Myanmar are a significant blow for the Biden administration and its effort to forge a robust Asia Pacific policy to stand up to China. Many of Biden's Asia policy team, including its head, Kurt Campbell, are veterans of the Obama administration, which at the end of former President Barack Obama's term hailed its work to end decades of military rule in Myanmar as a major foreign policy achievement. Biden served as Obama's vice president. Obama started easing sanctions in 2011 after the military began loosening its grip, and he announced in 2016 the lifting many of the remaining sanctions. But in 2019, the Trump administration imposed targeted sanctions on four military commanders, including General Min Aung Hlaing, over human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.

"Text of a statement from US President Donald Trump on the election result: ""We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don't want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media. ""Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room - and then fight in court to block their access. ""So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands."" "

"WASHINGTON: Former US president Donald Trump has announced his legal defence team for his Senate impeachment trial which is scheduled to begin on February 8. Trump became the first president in the US history to be impeached twice when 10 of his fellow Republican Congressmen joined Democrats in the House of Representatives on January 13 to charge him with inciting an unprecedented insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.  The Democrats need two-thirds of the vote for the Senate impeachment. If convicted, he could face being barred from ever holding office again.  Trump is the first US president facing an impeachment trial after he left the presidency. This is for the second time in about a year that he is likely to be acquitted by the Senate, as the Democrats do not have enough votes.  Currently, both the Democrats and the Republicans have 50 members each in the 100-seat Senate. The Democrats need the support of at least 17 Republican Senators to reach the two-thirds majority mark.  Trial lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L Castor Jr will head Trump's impeachment defence legal team, bringing national profiles and significant trial experience in high-profile cases to the effort, according to a statement issued by the office of former president Trump.  Notably, Schoen has already been working with Trump and other advisors to prepare for the upcoming trial, and both Schoen and Castor agree that this impeachment is unconstitutional - a fact 45 Senators voted in agreement last week, the statement said.  ""It is an honour to represent the 45th President, Donald J Trump, and the United States Constitution,"" said Schoen.  Castor said: ""I consider it a privilege to represent the 45th President. The strength of our Constitution is about to be tested like never before in our history. It is strong and resilient. A document written for the ages, and it will triumph over partisanship yet again, and always.""  Last month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the United States Senate would begin the impeachment trial of former president Trump on February 8.  In a bipartisan vote on January 13, the Democratic-controlled House impeached 74-year-old Trump for ""incitement of insurrection"" for his actions on January 6, when he delivered a speech inciting his supporters to storm the US Capitol.  The violence temporarily halted the counting of Electoral College votes and resulted in the deaths of five individuals, including a police officer. "
"NEW DELHI: India and the US are all set to kick off a major combat exercise in Rajasthan next week, in the first such bilateral wargame after the Biden administration took charge in Washington and reiterated Indiaâs role as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific as well as the need to strengthen the âQuadâ. Indian officials say the âYudh Abhyasâ exercise, which will be held at the Mahajan Field Firing ranges from February 8 to 21, will once again underscore the continuing upward trajectory in defence cooperation with the US, which enjoys bipartisan support among the Democrats and Republicans. The US contingent for Yudh Abhyas will include a brigade headquarters and a battalion group of around 250 soldiers from a Stryker Brigade Combat Team. India will also field an infantry brigade headquarters and a battalion group from the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry for the exercise. âThe aim is to further enhance interoperability in counter-terrorist operations in a semi-urban, semi-desert terrain, along with attack helicopters and infantry combat vehicles,â said an officer. Yudh Abhyas, which comes after India conducted the 24thedition of the top-notch `Malabarâ naval exercise with the other Quad countries (US, Japan and Australia) in November, will be followed by the âVajra Praharâ land combat exercise in March. The Malabar, of course, sent a strong strategic signal to China amidst the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, with the Quad nations stressing their commitment to âsupport a free, open, inclusive Indo-Pacific as well as a rules-based international orderâ. India, incidentally, also deployed a long-range Poseidon-8I maritime patrol aircraft and other personnel for the `Sea Dragonâ anti-submarine warfare exercise with the US, Japan, Australia and Canada from January 14 to 27 in Guam. The aim, interestingly, was to strengthen interoperability among partner nations for âregional contingenciesâ. The new US secretary of state Antony J Blinken, secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, in their talks with their Indian counterparts and elsewhere last week, have all conveyed their intention to carry forward the Indo-Pacific strategy of the previous Trump administration. âThe Biden administrationâs overall policy towards China will, of course, be more nuanced. But defence cooperation between India and the US will continue to be the main driver of the bilateral strategic partnership,â said an official. India has inked four âfoundational military pactsâ with the US, with the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Cooperation (BECA) being concluded last year. Beginning with the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) in 2002, the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was inked in 2016, and the Communications, Compatibility and Security Arrangement (COMCASA) in 2018. The US has also bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth over $21 billion just since 2007, with latest ones for 24 MH-60 âRomeoâ multirole naval helicopters and six more Apache attack choppers for $3 billion being inked during former President Donald Trumpâs visit here in February last year, as was reported by TOI. "
"NEW DELHI: As Joe Biden takes charge in Washington, the USâ China policy is likely to remain just as hard-nosed as it was during the Trump administration. In November, US State Department brought out its own version of George Kennanâs Long Telegram, but with China in its crosshairs. Elements of the China Challenge set out its own blueprint of how the US should deal with China. This week, a former, though anonymous, US administration official âwith deep expertise and experience dealing with Chinaâ drew another strategy for US to deal with China. Published by US think tank Atlantic Council, the strategy document, titled The Longer Telegram (yet another riff on George Kennan) says the US should target Chinese president Xi Jinping at the core of its strategy. Incidentally, Trumpâs deputy national security adviser, Matt Pottingerâs notes on China were leaked in the dying days of the Trump administration. âFor the United States, its allies, and the US-led liberal international order, this represents a fundamental shift in the strategic environment. Ignoring this profound change courts peril. Xi is no longer just a problem for US primacy. He now presents a serious problem for the whole of the democratic world.â The document states, âGiven the reality that todayâs China is a state in which Xi has centralized nearly all decision-making power in his own hands, and used that power to substantially alter Chinaâs political, economic, and foreign-policy trajectory, US strategy must remain laser focused on Xi, his inner circle, and the Chinese political context in which they rule. Changing their decision-making will require understanding, operating within, and changing their political and strategic paradigm. All US policy aimed at altering Chinaâs behavior should revolve around this fact, or it is likely to prove ineffectual. This strategy must also be long termâ¦â The document observes, correctly, that the Kennan document of 1946 pre-supposed a deep insight into the working of he Soviet system, thereby identifying its inherent flaws. China is much more careful, and has studied the causes of the destruction of the USSR much more than the USSRâs erstwhile enemies. âThe uncomfortable truth is that China has long had an integrated internal strategy for handling the United States, and so far this strategy has been implemented with reasonable, although not unqualified, success. By contrast, the United States, which once operationalized a unified strategy to deal with the challenge of the Soviet Union, in the form of George Kennanâs containment, so far has none in relation to China. This has been a dereliction of national responsibility.â The author says an âoperationalised strategyâ should comprise 7 components: rebuild the economic, military, technological, and human-capital underpinnings of US long-term national power; agree on a limited set of enforceable policy âred linesâ that China should be deterred from crossing under any circumstances; agree on a larger number of âmajor national security interestsâ which are neither vital nor existential in nature but which require a range of retaliatory actions to inform future Chinese strategic behavior; identify important but less critical areas where neither red lines nor the delineation of major national interests may be necessary, but where the full force of strategic competition should be deployed by the United States against China; prosecute a full-fledged, global ideological battle in defense of political, economic, and societal freedoms against Chinaâs authoritarian state-capitalist model â¦ among others. The document says the areas of strategic competition against China should include âsustaining current US force levels in the Indo-Pacific region; stabilizing relations with Russia and encouraging the same between Russia and Japan; concluding a fully operationalized Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) with India, Japan, and Australia by inducing India to abandon its final political and strategic reservations against such an arrangement, among other suggestions. The trouble with all of these is the nature of current US politics and economy. The document acknowledges that the US needs to work on itself before it works on China. Other analysts have suggested many of the same things to the US. But this document also focuses on one important issue: âIn the final analysis, the major problem facing the United States in confronting Xiâs China is not one of military, economic, or technological capabilities. It is one of self-belief.â "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump says he doesn't mind running against former Vice President Joe Biden, but he wouldn't want to run against his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. Speaking to supporters in Iowa on Wednesday, Trump got some of his biggest cheers when he brought up her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He joked, ""Please promise me, Amy, you'll never run."" Trump calls Barrett a ""great intellect"" who is deftly handling the questioning she is getting, particularly from Democrats, and ""she handles it like nothing.""  Trump says he hasn't spoken with Barrett for a few days, ""and I just want to say we made the right choice with Amy."" If Barrett is confirmed, which is expected, she would replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last month. "
"WASHINGTON: Days before the official certification of the November 3 US presidential elections in favour of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, President Donald Trump claimed that he would continue to hold the position as he has won the elections. Trump has been making unsubstantiated claims about widespread voter fraud and electoral malpractice in the presidential polls. State election officials and the media have denied such any such fraud. Election officials have declared Biden as the President-elect as he received more than the required 270 of the 538 electoral college votes. The elections are officially scheduled to be certified next week. However, Trump is continuing his legal efforts to upend Biden's victory. He has allowed the official start of Biden's transition to power but has not yet conceded defeat. The Trump campaign has filed multiple lawsuits in several states, most of whom have been dismissed so far. âHopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, a continuation -- which has led us to the highest stock markets we've ever had, the best employment numbers we've ever had, a rebuilt military,â Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday during a vaccine summit. Trump was responding to a question on why he did not invite members of the Biden transition team to the meeting, which deliberated on his plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccine in the US. âWe're going to have to see who the next administration is -- because we won in those swing states, and there was terrible things that went on. So we're going to have to see who the next administration is. But whichever the next administration is, will really benefit by what we've been able to do with this incredible science, the doctors -- all of the people that came up -- the lab technicians. The work that's been done is incredible, and it will be incredible for the next administration,â he said. ""And hopefully the next administration will be the Trump administration, because you can't steal hundreds of thousands of votes. You can't have fraud and deception and all of the things that they did, and then slightly win a swing state. And you just have to look at the numbers. Look at what's been on tape. Look at all the corruption. And we'll see. You can't win an election like that,â the president said. Trump said because of the ""great work"" he did, he was ""rewarded"" with a victory. âNow, let's see whether or not somebody has the courage -- whether it's a legislator or legislatures, or whether it's a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court. Let's see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right,â he said. The president said he has received almost 75 million votes, the highest number of votes in the history of the country for a sitting president, which is 12 million more than the 63 million he received four years ago. ""President (Barack) Obama received three million less in his second term, and he won easily. I received 12 million more, which, by the way, is a record. Twelve million more...If somebody has the courage, I know who the next administration will be. I'll tell you what: Life will be much easier for this country because of what we've done right now and because of a lot of the people in this room. The job you've done on the vaccine, together with a lot of others, has been a modern-day miracle, and it's really been acknowledged as such,"" Trump said. "
"NEW YORK : Progressive lawmakers this week formally launched an effort to hike the US minimum wage, introducing legislation to gradually raise it from $7.25 to $15 an hour. The proposed increase is much larger than those in the recent past, but supporters argue it is warranted because it has been more than a decade since the wage was lifted, and the current minimum wage is too little for life in the United States. First enacted by Congress in 1938 as part of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the wage has been amended several times, most recently in 2007, when Congress voted to lift it gradually from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. Since that time, several states and local governments have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour or to other levels both higher and lower. Of the 50 states, 21 currently honor the federal level of $7.25, while the remaining states have a higher minimum. Twenty-five states currently prohibit cities and counties from setting a higher local wage than the state level, according to Resourceful Compliance, which tracks labor law. Under legislation introduced by Democrats in the House and Senate, the minimum wage would rise to $9.50 an hour three months after the law is enacted, and then to $15 in four intervals over a five-year period. The proposal also raises base pay for waiters and other employees who rely on tips, and directs the US labor secretary to annually calculate the median hourly wage of all employees. In years where the median increases, the federal minimum wage would be raised by the same percentage. Economists have long debated whether the economic lift from boosting workers' purchasing power more than offsets the added wage burden on businesses. There is no consensus on the matter. ""There has been a debate for years,"" said Gregory Daco, Oxford Economics' chief US economist, noting that some studies have shown it can cause job losses, while others have not. Even the same study can be interpreted differently. Critics of the higher wage point to a finding in a 2019 Congressional Budget Office report that said lifting the level to $15 an hour would result in 1.3 million workers losing their jobs. But defenders of the measure noted that the same report said the proposal would lift 1.3 million people out of poverty and boost wages for as many as 27 million more workers, arguing these benefits more than counter the lost jobs. There is no consensus regarding the effects, as shown in Seattle, which in 2014 became the first major US city to adopt a $15 minimum wage. A 2018 study from the University of Washington said the policy reduced total payroll in low-income jobs, with wages rising by three percent but hours dropping by six to seven percent. But a 2017 study by the University of California, Berkeley found the policy increased wages in the food services industry with no employment loss. Howard Wright, the chief executive of the Seattle Hospitality Group and the co-author of the 2014 measure, said he largely discounts the conflicting appraisals of the Seattle policy. ""Our economy has been booming so strongly until Covid,"" said Wright. "
"WASHINGTON: Former President Donald Trump has parted ways with his lead impeachment lawyers just over a week before his Senate trial is set to begin, two people familiar with the situation said Saturday. Butch Bowers and Deborah Barbier, both South Carolina lawyers, are no longer with Trump's defense team. One of the people described the parting as a ``mutual decision'' that reflected a difference of opinion on the direction of the case. Both insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. One said new additions to the legal team were expected to be announced in a day or two. The upheaval injects fresh uncertainty into the makeup and strategy of Trump's defense team as he prepares to face charges that he incited the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. However, all but five Senate Republicans this week voted in favor of an effort to dismiss the trial before it even started, making clear a conviction of the former president is unlikely regardless of his defense team. Greg Harris and Johnny Gasser, two former federal prosecutors from South Carolina, are also off the team, one of the people said. Trump has struggled to find attorneys willing to defend him after becoming the first president in history to be impeached twice. He is set to stand trial the week of Feb. 8 on a charge that he incited his supporters to storm Congress before President Joe Biden's inauguration in an attempt to halt the peaceful transition of power. After numerous attorneys who defended him previously declined to take on the case, Trump was introduced to Bowers by one of his closest allies in the Senate, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Bowers, a familiar figure in Republican legal circles, had years of experience representing elected officials and political candidates, including then-South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford against a failed impeachment effort that morphed into an ethics probe. Bowers and Barbier did not immediately return messages seeking comment Saturday evening. Republicans and Trump aides have made clear that they intend to make a simple argument in the trial: Trump's trial is unconstitutional because he is no longer office. While Republicans in Washington had seemed eager to part ways with Trump after the deadly events of Jan. 6, they have since eased off of their criticism, weary of angering the former president's loyal voter base. CNN was first to report the departure of the lawyers. "
"FLORIDA: US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) said that the recent remarks by a World Health Organization envoy proved that he ""was right"" about not imposing Covid-19 lockdowns and said that the global health body, which was dominated by China was ""wrong about everything."" ""The World Health Organisation came out a little while ago and admitted that Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states where they are in lockdown,"" he said at a rally in Sanford, Florida. Trump was referring to remarks by WHO envoy David Nabarro, who was quoted in recent media reports as saying that restrictive measures like the lockdowns should only be treated as a last resort. He also said that lockdowns have severely impacted countries that rely on tourism. US president said that China, which has 1.4 billion people is paying USD 39 million per year to WHO in contrast to the US that is paying about USD 500 million. ""I took us out of the WHO because they were wrong about everything. Although, they corrected themselves--they say I was right about the lockdowns. (I asked) Why are we paying USD 500 million a year and China which has 1.4 billion people is paying USD 39 million per year -- they couldn't explain so I took us out,"" he said. Trump further attacked the World Health Organisation saying that they are being dominated by Beijing. ""China dominates them and I said it doesn't work that way anymore. They will take us back in so fast with less money,"" he said. Trump had this July pulled out his country from the WHO after he criticised the body for covering up the outbreak of COVID-19, which first emerged in China last year. The US has also backed out of a joint global effort led by the WHO to develop, manufacture and distribute a vaccine to cure coronavirus. Meanwhile, earlier on Twitter, he urged New York and other Democrat governors to open up from the lockdown. ""The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states, Democrat governors. Open up, New York. A long battle, but they finally did the right thing!"" he tweeted. "
"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration will name Robert Malley as its special envoy for Iran, a senior state department official said on Thursday. He would thus be given one of the most daunting and politically divisive foreign policy challenges facing the US government. Malley was a key member of former President Barack Obama's team that negotiated the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and world powers, an agreement that former president Donald Trump abandoned in 2018 despite strong opposition from Washington's European allies. ""Secretary Blinken is building a dedicated team, drawing from clear-eyed experts with a diversity of views. Leading that team as our special envoy for Iran will be Rob Malley, who brings to the position a track record of success negotiating constraints on Iranâs nuclear program,"" the state department official said. ""The secretary is confident he and his team will be able to do that once again,"" the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, referring to Biden's secretary of state Antony Blinken. The state department declined comment. Malley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When Malley's name first surfaced in news reports as a leading candidate for the post, he drew criticism from some Republican lawmakers and pro-Israel groups that expressed concern that he would be soft on Iran and tough on Israel. But a number of foreign policy veterans rushed to his defence, praising him as a respected, even-handed diplomat. The post would make Malley the point person in Biden's efforts to deal with Iran after years of worsening relations under Trump, who, after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, reimposed crippling economic sanctions. The Diplomatic news website was first to report on Malley's expected appointment. He held numerous senior positions in the Democratic administrations of Obama and former President Bill Clinton with a focus on Middle East and Gulf policymaking and informally advised Biden's team during the 2020 campaign. Most recently, he was the president of the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organization focused on global conflict. Crafting Iran policyMalley's expected appointment comes as Biden and his foreign policy aides move to craft their approach to Iran. Malley is expected to report directly to Blinken, a source familiar with the matter said. Biden's top diplomat on Wednesday stuck to the new administration's stance that Tehran must resume complying with the Iran nuclear deal before Washington would do so. Making his first public comments on Iran as secretary of state, Blinken reiterated Biden's policy ""that if Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same thing."" But Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Twitter on Thursday that the United States should make the first move by returning to the nuclear pact. The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck by Iran and six major powers and committed Iran to restricting its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief from the United States and others. Israel and Gulf Arab states strongly opposed the deal as not stringent enough on Tehran. Malley, the son of an Egyptian journalist and Iran expert, was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign but resigned after it emerged he had met with representatives of the Palestinian militant group Hamas while working for the International Crisis Group. Malley was later brought into the Obama administration, in which Biden served as Vice President, as a top Middle East adviser. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump will try to put his bout with Covid-19 behind him when he returns to the campaign trail on Monday, beginning a three-week sprint to the November 3 election with a rally in the vital battleground state of Florida. The event at an airport in Sanford, Florida, will be Trump's first campaign rally since he disclosed on October 2 that he tested positive for COVID-19. Trump, who spent three days in the hospital for treatment, said on Sunday he was fully recovered and no longer infectious, but did not say directly whether he had tested negative for the virus. The Republican president is seeking to change the dynamics of a race that opinion polls show he is losing to Democratic rival Joe Biden just 21 days before Election Day. For months, Trump had worked furiously to shift public attention away from the virus and his handling of the pandemic, which has infected nearly 7.7 million people in the United States, killed more than 214,000 and put millions out of work. But his own illness has put the spotlight squarely on his coronavirus response during the closing stretch of the race. Biden, in a sign of fresh optimism as he leads Trump in national and many key state polls, heads on Monday to Ohio, a state Trump won by 8 percentage points in 2016. It is Biden's second campaign trip in as many weeks to Ohio, which was once thought out of reach but where polls now show a tight race. Trump's rally in Florida, and planned rallies in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Iowa on Wednesday and North Carolina on Thursday, will be watched closely to see whether the president has changed his approach to campaigning since contracting the virus. He has been criticized for failing to encourage supporters at campaign events, and even White House staff, to wear protective masks and abide by social-distancing guidelines. At least 11 close Trump aides have tested positive for the coronavirus. Trump, speaking from a White House balcony on Saturday, urged hundreds of largely Black and Latino supporters to help get out the vote. Standing alone, Trump was not wearing a mask as he spoke. Most in the crowd were wearing masks but not following social-distancing guidelines. Asked on Saturday if Trump should be resuming rallies, Biden said it was important that he makes it clear to all those in attendance the importance of staying socially distanced and wearing masks. ""That's the only responsible thing to do,"" Biden told reporters. Florida up for grabsTrump told Fox News in an interview on Sunday that he felt good and pointed to his physician's memo from Saturday saying he had taken a test showing he was no longer infectious. ""I passed the highest test, the highest standards, and I'm in great shape,"" Trump told ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Trump also said, without producing evidence, that he was now immune, an assertion that drew a flag from Twitter for violating the social media platform's rules about misleading information related to COVID-19. The scientific research has been inconclusive on how long people who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies and are protected from a second infection. Most recent polls in Florida, where a Trump loss would dramatically narrow his path to re-election, show Biden with a small lead. Trump won Florida over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 by just 1.2 percentage points, which helped propel him to the White House. On his visit to Ohio, Biden will deliver a speech in Toledo meant to undermine what polls show is Trump's last greatest strength, the view among some voters that the former real estate entrepreneur is better on handling the economy. Biden also will attend a get-out-the-vote event in Cincinnati, his campaign said. Trump has pulled back his advertising in Ohio in recent days, while Biden has increased his, another sign of the opportunity the former vice president and his fellow Democrats see to make more states competitive than they initially imagined. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump claimed on Sunday that he is now ""immune"" from the coronavirus, though medical research has suggested it is possible to be re-infected with the virus. ""It seems like I'm immune, so I can go way out of a basement,"" Trump said in an interview on Fox News. ""It looks like I'm immune for, I don't know, maybe a long time, maybe a short time. It could be a lifetime. Nobody really knows,"" Trump added, Xinhua news agency reported. White House physician Sean Conley said on Saturday that the president, who tested positive for Covid-19 on October 1 and was later hospitalized for three days before returning to the White House with continued treatment, is ""no longer considered a transmission risk to others."" However, Conley did not disclose when Trump last had a negative test result. A study published in September in the journal Nature Medicine, however, indicated that recovery from the coronavirus does not confer lifetime immunity. Before and after Trump's infection, a number of White House staff members have also tested positive for the virus. "
"HYDERABAD: US president Donald Trumpâs diehard fan, 32-year-old Bussa Krishna of Jangaon district, who had constructed a temple for him in his house, died of a heart attack on Sunday. Krishna died in Toopran in Siddipet district, just a week after he made a video in which he was profusely weeping because Trump had contracted Covid-19. In the video on October 4, Bussa Krishna said he was praying that his âgodâ would recover. At Bussa Krishnaâs house in Konne village in Bachannapet mandal, Krishna installed a six-foot tall statue of Trump and regularly performed puja since. The farmer also used to put up photographs of Trump in his field and carried a photograph of Trump in his pocket for past four years. A cricket fan that he was, Krishna said he had a dream in which Trump assured him that India would beat Pakistan in the cricket world cup in June last year. That came true. âI am feeling sad because Trump has been infected with Covid. I have been in love with my âgodâ for the past four years,â he had said in the video. Locals of Konne village said since the US president tested positive for Covid, Krishna was in agony. âHe was not even taking food properly and not sleeping,â a local person said. "
"VALDOSTA, United States: President Donald Trump made clear Saturday he had no intention of relinquishing his baseless claims that last month's election was stolen from him, telling a raucous crowd at his first post-poll rally he would somehow still win. In a speech remarkable for its twisting of reality more than a month after the November 3 election, the outgoing president launched into another litany of allegations that the polls won handily by Democrat Joe Biden were rigged. The crowd in Valdosta, Georgia for what was nominally a rally in support of two Republican Senate candidates facing a hugely consequential runoff election roared in support, at one point chanting ""fight for Trump."" https://t.co/t1nwOScuF6— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1607222554000Even with Covid-19 cases surging nationwide, there were few masks in the crowd and many ignored social-distancing rules. In a nearly two-hour speech Trump, 74, declared he would not concede, at times sticking to his script but regularly going off-the-cuff for his more incendiary claims. ""We're winning this election,"" Trump told the rally, which was similar to his many gatherings prior to the election, down to the soaring country song ""God Bless the USA"" played as he took the stage with First Lady Melania Trump. ""It's rigged. It's a fixed deal."" It was yet another example of Trump breaking democratic norms, engaging in conspiracy-mongering and presenting falsehoods in ways unprecedented in US history. His stance has raised the question of how he will react when Biden's January 20 swearing-in date arrives. ""The swing states that we're all fighting over now, I won them all by a lot,"" Trump said, falsely. ""And I have to say, if I lost, I'd be a very gracious loser. If I lost, I would say, I lost, and I'd go to Florida and I'd take it easy and I'd go around and I'd say I did a good job. But you can't ever accept when they steal and rig and rob."" Trump has barely left the White House since Biden was projected winner of the election on November 7, though he has made a number of trips to his nearby golf course. There had been concerns from some Republicans over whether Trump's continuing claims of fraud would drive down voter turnout among Republicans in the upcoming election, making his appearance in Georgia somewhat of a gamble. The runoff election will decide which party controls the US Senate, and Trump in his speech continued his fear-mongering about rival Democrats. ""The voters of Georgia will determine which party runs every committee, writes every piece of legislation, controls every single taxpayer dollar,"" he said. ""Very simply, you will decide whether your children will grow up in a socialist country or whether they will grow up in a free country."" If Democratic challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeat Republican senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, the Senate will be evenly divided at 50-50, meaning Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris would cast any deciding votes, as the Constitution dictates. The race has drawn enormous attention. One measure of the intense interest: With donations pouring in from across the country, the candidates have already spent more than $315 million, the AdImpact website reported, an astounding figure for senatorial races. And figures as prominent as ex-president Barack Obama, Vice President Mike Pence and now Trump himself have scrambled to boost voter turnout. But while Trump offered words of praise for the two Republicans and invited them on stage for brief comments on Saturday, he spent much of the time arguing that he had won the election. Despite an overwhelming series of setbacks in the courts, the president and his lawyers have advanced wild conspiracy theories (one involving the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez) to explain Biden's victory. Biden won Georgia by just under 12,000 votes. That result, while narrow, has been confirmed by subsequent recounts, making all the more surprising a phone call Saturday from Trump to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp reportedly urging him to press state legislators to overturn the result. The Washington Post said Kemp, once a devoted Trump ally, refused the entreaty. Loeffler and Perdue have moved cautiously, urging Georgians to vote without directly challenging Trump's complaints. But Trump has not made things easier for Georgia Republicans, angrily attacking officials in his own party over his loss there, starting with Kemp. He has denounced Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger as an ""enemy of the people."" But on Saturday night, there were flashes where it seemed Trump may be beginning to accept what lies ahead. At one point, he said half-jokingly: ""A friend of mine said, 'Oh don't worry about it sir, you're way up in the polls, you'll win in 2024.' I said, 'I don't want to wait until 2024. I want to go back three weeks.'"" "
"WASHINGTON: Democrat Joe Biden leads in the national polls and most of the battleground states going into Election Day but President Donald Trump is insisting they're wrong and he'll repeat his upset victory of 2016. Biden, the 77-year-old former vice president, has enjoyed a solid lead over Trump, 74, in the national polls for months, at times reaching double digits. But US presidential elections are not decided by the popular vote. They are won in the 538-member Electoral College, where each state has a number of electoral votes equivalent to its representation in the House and Senate. And the electoral votes of battleground states such as Florida and Pennsylvania could determine the winner of Tuesday's battle for the White House. Here is a look at the latest national polls and polls in key battleground states: An average of national polls by the RealClearPolitics (RCP) website gives Biden a 6.7 point lead over Trump- 51 percent to 44.3 percent. That is roughly in line with the averages of other leading outlets such as FiveThirtyEight.com, which has Biden up by 8.5 points nationally. Biden's lead nationally is more than double that of Hillary Clinton going into the 2016 election, when the polls were relatively accurate concerning the popular vote, which she won while losing in the Electoral College. In Florida, Biden has a one-point lead over Trump, according to the RCP average of state polls. A Siena College/New York Times poll has Biden up by three points in the Sunshine State but a Washington Post/ABC News poll has the Republican incumbent up by two points. Trump won Florida and its 29 electoral votes in 2016 and winning the state again is seen as crucial to his hopes of victory. In Pennsylvania, Biden has a 4.3-point lead, according to the RCP average of polls in the Keystone State, which has 20 electoral votes. Trump won Pennsylvania by just 44,000 votes in 2016 and his reelection hopes could hang on taking the state again. Michigan and Wisconsin are two Midwestern states Trump won narrowly in 2016 but the RCP averages have him trailing in both this time. According to the RCP averages, Biden is up by 5.1 points in Michigan, which has 16 electoral votes, and by 6.6 points in Wisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes. The battleground states of Arizona and North Carolina, both of which Trump won in 2016, are also being closely watched. According to the RCP averages, Biden has a one-point lead in Arizona, which has 11 electoral votes, while Trump leads by 0.6 points in North Carolina, which has 15 electoral votes. Four other states are also being closely watched this time- Georgia (16 electoral votes), Iowa (six), Ohio (18) and Texas (38). Trump won all four states relatively easily in 2016 but the polls are showing close races there this time. Biden is up by 0.4 points in Georgia, according to the RCP average, a state Trump won by 5.1 points in 2016. Trump is up by 1.4 points in Iowa- he won by 9.4 points four years ago- and by 0.2 points in Ohio, a significantly smaller margin than his 8.1-point win last time around. Trump won Texas, one of the biggest prizes of the night, by nine points in 2016 but the RCP average gives him a narrow 1.2 point lead there ahead of Tuesday's vote. "
"A Connecticut man who pleaded guilty last year to a series of hoaxes, including sending a letter with white powder threatening to kill President Donald Trump, was sentenced Wednesday to nine years in prison. The man, Gary Joseph Gravelle, 53, of New Haven, pleaded guilty to seven charges related to threats he made in September 2018, according to John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut. In early September 2018, Gravelle sent a threatening letter addressed to Trump accompanied by a white powdery substance that Gravelle claimed was anthrax, according to court records. Other recipients of Gravelleâs threatening messages included federal probation officers, mental health providers and a credit union. He also threatened to blow up planes and property at the Burlington International Airport in Vermont. Judge Kari Dooley of U.S. District Court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, sentenced Gravelle to more than seven years in prison for the threats he made in 2018 and an additional two years for violating conditions of his release. Gravelle has been incarcerated since his arrest Sept. 8, 2018, and had previously been jailed for sending threatening messages in 2010, according to Durhamâs office. His guilt or innocence has never been much disputed, according to officials and Gravelleâs lawyer. What has not been determined is where Gravelle, who has a history of mental illness, will serve his sentence. Gravelle is in the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island, where he is receiving medication but not seeing a therapist regularly, according to his lawyer, Joseph Patten Brown. Whether Gravelle serves his sentence there, or at a hospital, will be determined by the federal Bureau of Prisons, Brown said. Brown would prefer the latter. âPeople like Gary are now just housed in jails instead of places where they can at least get some treatment,â he said in an interview. In a sentencing memo to the court, Brown wrote that his client was âa sick manâ who had âno intent to follow throughâ on his threats âor seeming ability to do so.â Gravelle targeted people âwith no seeming patternâ with regard to ideology, race or creed, Brown wrote. His client âhas no agenda other than a misguided cry for help.â Prosecutors, in their sentencing memo, acknowledged Gravelleâs history of mental illness but said his threats had deeply affected the victims. Gravelleâs threats âdisrupted the daily lives of many and no doubt seriously frightened their recipients,â prosecutors wrote. The victims, prosecutors wrote, âhad no role in creating any of the defendantâs problems but are forced to bear the brunt of them nonetheless.â "
"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has a higher approval rating after one week in office than Donald Trump did in his entire presidency, a new poll found Wednesday. A Monmouth University poll showed 54 percent of Americans approving of Biden's performance and 30 percent disapproving.  Trump spent most of his presidency with ratings in the low 40s, and left office on January 20 with a Gallup poll approval of just 34 percent, a record low.  A Morning Consult tracking poll published Monday gave Biden 56 percent approval and 34 percent disapproval. Another poll released Monday, by Hill-HarrisX, showed Biden with 63 percent approval.  Despite the strong showing for the Democrat, the results also demonstrate severe polarization in the United States after Trump's four-year term.  In the Monmouth poll, Biden won 90 percent approval from Democrats but only 47 percent from independents and 15 percent from Republicans.  ""Overall, there seems to be more goodwill for Biden than there was for Trump, but it really breaks down along partisan lines. Right now, more people identify as Democrats than Republicans,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.  According to data from the fivethirtyeight.com site, Trump was the first president in half a century not to enjoy a honeymoon period with substantially better polling in the first six months.  Barack Obama had an average of 60 percent approval in his first half year and his predecessor George W Bush had 53.9 percent.  Trump, by contrast, had an average approval rating of 41.4 percent in his first six months. "
"OTTAWA: Residents of an Ottawa neighborhood are looking to distance themselves from Donald Trump by renaming their street, which bears his name -- once a source of intrigue, but now an embarrassment. Trump Avenue on the Canadian capital's west side is lined with brick homes, each with two-car garages and kids playing hockey in driveways. The Central Park neighborhood, known for New York City-themed street names, was built in the late 1990s -- long before a certain Big Apple real estate mogul entered politics. There's also a Madison Park, Bloomingdale Street, Manhattan Crescent, and Staten Way in the area. Bonnie Bowering moved here in 2008. ""When I used to tell people I live on Trump Avenue and I would add, 'Yes, it is The Donald,' people would smirk, some offered sympathies, that sort of thing,"" she told AFP. ""But now -- after he's undermined democracy, and incited an insurrection, a violent attack on the US Capitol -- it's time to change our street name,"" she said. ""Trump doesn't deserve the honor and I think it's inappropriate to have a street named after him in Canada's capital."" Ottawa city councilor Riley Brockington started gathering support for the name change from people who live on the street this week. Some residents had been petitioning the city for years to change it, but Brockington resisted, saying he feared offending Trump while he was in office. ""I was concerned that there might be ramifications against Canada, that Trump would take punitive measures if word got out that Canada's national capital wanted to take his name off a street sign,"" Brockington said. ""With his exit from the White House, I felt now was a good time to try it."" At least 50 percent of residents must agree to the name change to trigger a process that would take several months. That's not soon enough for Diane Hosker, who was out walking her dog Tuesday afternoon. ""It was a novelty at first, a fun way to start off a conversation when you told people where you lived,"" she said. ""Now it's an embarrassment."" ""The man's an idiot and I don't like his brand of politics,"" she added. Nearby, a father stuck his head out of his front door to call his son in from the cold, and nodded in agreement. Changing the street's name would require new signage, but also new maps and postal addresses for 62 homes. And then there's the matter of selecting a new name. Most other New York names are already taken in Ottawa, and numbered street names such as Fifth Avenue won't do. ""We already have one of those in Ottawa,"" Bowering explained. ""I hope we end up with a name that everybody is happy with,"" she concluded. ""Of course, some people say 'Anything would be better.'"" "
"NEW YORK: ""Withdrawn"". A single word on a thick bureaucratic file on the seventh day of the Biden administration delivered a huge win for spouses of workers on H-1B visas in the US who spent the last four years worried sick that their work authorisations would be killed off. The latest development brings to an end years of effort by the Donald Trump administration to rescind an Obama era regulation that allowed a certain subset of spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US. Up until the summer of 2015, H-4 visa holders could not legally hold paid employment in the United States. Almost as soon as Obama changed the game, the lawsuits followed and then the Trump presidency took the attack on the H-4 work permit to a whole new level. On text messages, chat groups and online threads, the outpouring of relief played out online on Tuesday evening. ""Great news! Hopefully H4EAD delays will be ending soon which is leading to a long wait for dependent spouses,"" tweeted Rashi Bhatnagar. Sharmistha Mohapatra posted, ""Big win for H4 EAD holders today. Former Pres Trump's EO to rescind H4 EAD is now withdrawn by POTUS. Let's hope excruciating long wait times often resulting in job loss is taken away too!"" From the time the skewering of the H-4 work permit (called the EAD) began in Fall 2017, the proposed rule has been published seven times for ongoing review, keeping the H-4 community on cliff-edge. The Trump government justified the move saying it is ""economically significant"" and aligns with the ""Buy American and Hire American"" executive order, which was mostly code for keeping foreign workers out of the US and flinging red meat to the Trump base. Now, the backlink to that Trump executive order ends up as a 404 (page not found) error and re-routes to the Biden White House. ""Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorization"" was a Trumpian agenda pursued by White House immigration hawks with intense zeal and inter-agency collaboration. It was being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), where it was parked for months. The pressure on the H4 community never really let up since Trump took office. The decision to rescind the proposed rule on revoking the H4 work permit came on the same day Biden signed an executive order calling for the practice of racial equity in the United States. Data from the US government show that Indian and Chinese workers account for the lion's share of H-1B visas. H-4 visas typically follow the same trajectory. Indians filed 74 per cent of all H-1B petitions in fiscal year 2019. Chinese filed 11.8 per cent. "
"WASHINGTON: He's gone, he's golfing, but from his palm lined Florida hideaway Donald Trump is also plotting revenge. If many Americans -- perhaps discreetly including a number of senior Republicans -- wished Trump would just disappear at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, they're in for a sore disappointment. As an impeachment trial clanks into gear in Washington, the disgraced ex-president is making clear to Republican senators that they need to remember he is a major force. An announcement on Monday that he was opening ""the Office of the Former President"" in his new hometown reminded them. ""President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American People,"" the statement said. Senators are considering Trump's fate in the first impeachment trial ever of a former president and -- after last year's version -- the first time a president has been twice impeached at all. But Trump -- winner of 74 million votes in his defeat to Biden on November 3 and reportedly sitting on some $70 million in campaign funds -- wants Republican senators to consider their own futures before they dare cross him. At least 17 Republicans would need to join the 50 Senate Democrats for a conviction in his trial. Every day that goes by, this appears less likely. On Tuesday, a Republican senator's motion to declare the trial unconstitutional got support from all but five Republicans, the strongest indication yet that a bipartisan conviction is dead on arrival. Yes, a lot of Republican lawmakers are furious at Trump's incitement of a crowd to march on Congress on January 6 in a bid to interrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election win. But Republicans also want to win back the House of Representatives and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections and the White House in 2024. And for now at least, being pro-Trump is arguably the best way to achieve this. According to a January Washington Post-ABC News poll, nearly six in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the party needs to remain under Trump's leadership. Trump's main way of applying pressure while out of office is to threaten disloyal legislators with support for their challengers in party primary votes ahead of the 2022 midterms. Trump's endorsement on Monday of his former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her bid to become governor of Arkansas was a first flexing of political muscle. Sanders is competing with more senior party officials in the state for the shot at high office. But in the race to be the most loyal Trump acolyte, she already wins hands down and can expect to reap the rewards. For those who have failed the Trump purity test, nervous days await. During the four years of his presidency, Trump ground down almost any internal opposition. So he was stung by the outpouring of criticism over his actions on January 6 and he'd like revenge. Those on the list include the 10 Republicans in the House who voted with Democrats for his impeachment and now are likely to face primary challenges. If senators go further by voting for his conviction, that would trigger an even harsher response from Trump and grassroot Republicans who believe his lie that he was robbed of election victory. Responding to reports that Trump was considering founding a breakaway right-wing party, advisor Jason Miller told Axios that the ex-president is fully supportive of the Republican Party -- for now. ""It's completely up to Republican senators if this is something that becomes more serious,"" he was quoted as saying. One Republican feeling the tension is Marco Rubio, a senator in Florida. He is loyally attacking the impeachment trial as a ""waste of time"" and ""vengeance from the radical left."" But is this enough? Rubio did not support Trump's last-minute attempts to challenge congressional certification of Biden's victory, putting him in the potential crosshairs. Speculation is rife that Rubio's seat could be challenged in the 2022 primary by none other than Ivanka Trump, the ex-president's ambitious daughter and former White House advisor. Asked about this scenario by Fox News on Sunday, Rubio looked uncomfortable. "
"WASHINGTON: The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Antony Blinken as America's top diplomat, tasked with carrying out President Joe Biden's commitment to reverse the Trump administration's ""America First'' doctrine that weakened international alliances. Senators voted 78-22 to approve Blinken, a longtime Biden confidant, as the nation's 71st secretary of state, succeeding Mike Pompeo. The position is the most senior Cabinet position, with the secretary fourth in the line of presidential succession. Blinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. He has pledged to be a leading force in the administration's bid to reframe the US relationship with the rest of the world after four years in which President Donald Trump questioned longtime alliances. He is expected to start work on Wednesday after being sworn in, according to State Department officials. ""American leadership still matters,'' Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his Jan. 19 confirmation hearing. ""The reality is, the world simply does not organize itself. When we're not engaged, when we're not leading, then one of two things is likely to happen. Either some other country tries to take our place, but not in a way that's likely to advance our interests and values, or maybe just as bad, no one does and then you have chaos.'' Blinken vowed that the Biden administration would approach the world with both humility and confidence, saying ""we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad.'' Despite promising renewed American leadership and an emphasis on shoring up strained ties with allies in Europe and Asia, Blinken told lawmakers that he agreed with many of Trump's foreign policy initiatives. He backed the so-called Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, and a tough stance on China over human rights and its assertiveness in the South China Sea. He did, however, signal that the Biden administration is interested in bringing Iran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew in 2018. Trump's secretaries of state nominees met with significant opposition from Democrats. Trump's first nominee for the job, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, was approved by a 56 to 43 vote and served only 13 months before Trump fired him in tweet. His successor, Pompeo, was confirmed in a 57-42 vote. Opposition to Blinken centered on Iran policy and concerns among conservatives that he will abandon Trump's ""maximum pressure'' campaign against Iran. Blinken inherits a deeply demoralized and depleted career workforce at the State Department. Neither Tillerson nor Pompeo offered strong resistance to the Trump administration's attempts to gut the agency, which were thwarted only by congressional intervention. Although the department escaped proposed cuts of more than 30% of its budget for three consecutive years, it has seen a significant number of departures from its senior and rising mid-level ranks, Many diplomats opted to retire or leave the foreign service given limited prospects for advancement under an administration that they believed didn't value their expertise. A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School and a longtime Democratic foreign policy presence, Blinken has aligned himself with numerous former senior national security officials who have called for a major reinvestment in American diplomacy and renewed emphasis on global engagement. Blinken served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration before becoming staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chair of the panel. In the early years of the Obama administration, Blinken returned to the NSC and was then-Vice President Biden's national security adviser before he moved to the State Department to serve as deputy to Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now serving as special envoy for climate change. "
"WASHINGTON: Democrats marched the impeachment case against Donald Trump to the Senate Monday night for the start of his historic trial, but Republican senators were easing off their criticism of the former president and shunning calls to convict him over the deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol. It's an early sign of Trump's enduring sway over the party. The House prosecutors delivered the sole impeachment charge of ``incitement of insurrection,`` making the ceremonial walk across the Capitol to the Senate. But Republican denunciations of Trump have cooled since the Jan. 6 riot. Instead Republicans are presenting a tangle of legal arguments against the legitimacy of the trial and questions whether Trump's repeated demands to overturn Joe Biden's election really amounted to incitement. What seemed for some Democrats like an open-shut case that played out for the world on live television, as Trump encouraged a rally mob to ``fight like hell`` for his presidency, is running into a Republican Party that feels very differently. Not only are there legal concerns, but senators are wary of crossing the former president and his legions of followers who are their voters. Security remains tight at the Capitol. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said if Congress starts holding impeachment trials of former officials, what's next: ``Could we go back and try President Obama?'' Besides, he suggested, Trump has already been held to account. ``One way in our system you get punished is losing an election.'' Arguments in the Senate trial will begin the week of Feb. 8, and the case against Trump, the first former president to face impeachment trial, will test a political party still sorting itself out for the post-Trump era. Republican senators are balancing the demands of deep-pocketed donors who are distancing themselves from Trump and voters who demand loyalty to him. One Republican, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, announced Monday he would not seek reelection in 2022 citing the polarized political atmosphere. For Democrats the tone, tenor and length of the upcoming trial, so early in Biden's presidency, poses its own challenge, forcing them to strike a balance between their vow to hold Trump accountable and their eagerness to deliver on the new administration's priorities following their sweep of control of the House, Senate and White House. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans appear more eager to argue over trial process than the substance of the impeachment case against Trump, perhaps to avoid casting judgment on the former president's ``role in fomenting the despicable attack'' on the Capitol. He said there's only one question ``senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience: Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?'' Failing to conduct the trial would amount to a ``get-out-jail-free card'' for other officials accused of wrongdoing on their way out the door, Schumer said. On Monday, it was learned that Chief Justice John Roberts is not expected to preside at the trial, as he did during Trump's first impeachment, potentially affecting the gravitas of the proceedings. The shift is said to be in keeping with protocol because Trump is no longer in office. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D- Vt., who serves in the largely ceremonial role of Senate president pro-tempore, is set to preside. Leaders in both parties agreed to a short delay in the proceedings that serves their political and practical interests, even as National Guard troops remain at the Capitol amid security threats on lawmakers ahead of the trial. The start date gives Trump's new legal team time to prepare its case, while also providing more than a month's distance from the passions of the bloody riot. For the Democratic-led Senate, the intervening weeks provide prime time to confirm some of Biden's key Cabinet nominees. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., questioned how his colleagues who were in the Capitol that day could see the insurrection as anything other than a ``stunning violation'' of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power. ``It is a critical moment in American history,'' Coons said Sunday in an interview. An early vote to dismiss the trial probably would not succeed, given that Democrats now control the Senate. Still, the mounting Republican opposition to the proceedings indicates that many GOP senators would eventually vote to acquit Trump. Democrats would need the support of 17 Republicans _ a high bar _ to convict him. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he doesn't believe the Senate has the constitutional authority to convict Trump after he has left office. ``I think a lot of Americans are going to think it's strange that the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove from office a man who left office a week ago,'' Cotton said. Democrats reject that argument, pointing to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who had already resigned and to opinions by many legal scholars. Democrats also say that a reckoning of the first invasion of the Capitol since the War of 1812, perpetrated by rioters egged on by a president as Electoral College votes were being tallied, is necessary to ensure such a siege never happens again. A few GOP senators have agreed with Democrats, though not close to the number that will be needed to convict Trump. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said he believes ``what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense.'' Romney said, ``If not, what is?'' But Romney, the lone Republican to vote to convict Trump when the Senate acquitted the then-president in last year's trial, appears to be an outlier. "
"ISLAMABAD: The Afghan government on Saturday welcomed the move by the Biden administration to review the February 2020 deal that Washington had signed with Taliban insurgents. Sediq Sediqqi, spokesperson of Afghan President Dr Ashraf Ghani, said in a statement that the US-Taliban agreement has so far failed to deliver the desired goal of ending Taliban violence and bringing a ceasefire. âThe Taliban did not live up to its commitments,â he said. His statement followed a phone conversation between Jake Sullivan, the new US national security adviser, and his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib. The Biden administration on Friday said that it was looking to review the deal between Washington and the Taliban. In the conversation with Sullivan, Mohib said that they agreed to work towards a permanent ceasefire and a just and durable peace in Afghanistan âcapable of preserving the gains of the past two decades, protecting the rights of all Afghans, and continuing the reforms.â In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mohib said that Sullivan affirmed that the partnership with the government of Afghanistan and Afghan security and defense forces remains a priority and a key to US national security objectives. âWe will continue close consultations in the days and weeks ahead,â he added. Last week, following the targeted assassination of two female judges in the capital Kabul, the US Embassy warned the Taliban to cease attacks on civilians for peace to come to Afghanistan. âThe Taliban should understand that such actions for which it bears responsibility outrage the world and must cease if peace is to come to Afghanistan,â tweeted Ross Wilson, the US chargÃ© dâaffaires. The review comes amid the stalled intra-Afghan talks in the Qatari capital of Doha, which aimed at ending the nearly two-decade conflict in war-torn Afghanistan. Former US President Donald Trump had made the withdrawal of US Nato troops from Afghanistan a priority. According to the US-Taliban deal, the US and Nato allies would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by May this year if the Taliban upheld its promises. The promises included not to allow militant outfits to operate from areas controlled by the Taliban, shunning violence and to start dialogue with the government in Kabul. Following the deal, the militants halted attacks to a greater extent on foreign troops but intensified its fight against Kabul, with the country having seen a wave of targeted killings in recent months. Journalists, activists, politicians and women judges were among those killed in targeted assassinations. Given the volatile situation in the war-torn country, the new US administration has said that it will review a peace deal that President Trump had made with the Taliban. "
"WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court on Monday brought an end to lawsuits over whether Donald Trump illegally profited off his presidency. The justices threw out Trump's challenge to lower court rulings that had allowed lawsuits to go forward alleging that he violated the Constitution's emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International Hotel and patronize other businesses owned by the former president and his family. The high court also ordered the lower court rulings thrown out as well and directed appeals courts in New York and Richmond, Virginia, to dismiss the suits as moot now that Trump is no longer in office. The outcome leaves no judicial opinions on the books in an area of the law that has been rarely explored in US history. The cases involved suits filed by Maryland and the District of Columbia, and high-end restaurants and hotels in New York and Washington, DC, that ""found themselves in the unenviable position of having to compete with businesses owned by the President of the United States.''"" The suits sought financial records showing how much state and foreign governments have paid the Trump Organization to stay and eat at Trump-owned properties. Other cases involving Trump remain before the Supreme Court, or in lower courts. Trump is trying to block the Manhattan district attorney 's enforcement of a subpoena for his tax returns. Lower courts are weighing congressional subpoenas for Trump's financial records. And the justices also have before them Trump's appeal of a decision forbidding him from blocking critics on his Twitter account. Like the emoluments cases, Trump's appeal would seem to be moot now that he is out of office and also had his Twitter account suspended. "
"WASHINGTON: A banner apparently flew near former US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Sunday, calling him the worst President ever. The banner can be seen trailing behind a plane in a video shared Sunday by Twitter user Daniel Uhlfelder that read, ""TRUMP WORST PRESIDENT EVER."" Trump is getting warm welcome from the skies near Mar-a-lago today https://t.co/S6uUFx3t30— Daniel Uhlfelder (@DWUhlfelderLaw) 1611517746000In a separate tweet by Uhlfelder, a photo also shows a banner reading ""TRUMP, YOU PATHETIC LOSER GO BACK TO MOSCOW."" ""Trump is getting a warm welcome from the skies near Mar-a-Lago today,"" Uhlfelder tweeted. Social media also jumped in and hailed the move by saying. ""Bravo!"" and ""This gave me a lil joy."" ""Thanks for posting and a big thanks to this pilot. This just makes my day. Thanks again,"" another user wrote. A user by the name of Janice wrote that the banner is ""A reminder there are a lot of good people in Florida."" CNN reported that many members of Mar-a-Lago are leaving because they no longer want to have any connection to former President Trump, according to the author of the definitive book about the resort. Trump's presidency officially ended last week after four years in the Oval Office, he returned to Florida from Washington on Wednesday. He did not attend President Joe Biden's inauguration in the US Capitol that day. On January 6, a group of then-President Donald Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to protest against law makers confirming electoral slates from battleground US states they thought were invalid. Trump had made a speech among thousands of supporters reiterating his claim a massive voter fraud had robbed his election victory and encouraged supporters to maintain support to ""stop the steal."" Five people died in the riot, including one police officer as well as one Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot dead by police. "
"WASHINGTON: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to send the Senate a single article of impeachment Monday accusing Donald Trump of inciting the Capitol riot, formally triggering the first-ever impeachment trial of a former president. Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, vowed last week that the trial -- already scheduled to open in the second week of February -- should proceed, saying, ""I don't think it will be long, but we must do it."" But Republican lawmakers signaled over the weekend that Democrats may struggle to secure Trump's conviction over the storming of US legislative buildings earlier this month, which left five people dead. Senior figures in Trump's party have pushed back with both political and constitutional arguments, raising doubts that Democrats -- who control 50 seats in the 100-seat chamber -- can secure the 17 Republican votes to reach the two-thirds majority needed to convict. ""I think the trial is stupid. I think it's counterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top,"" Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Fox News Sunday. He acknowledged that Trump -- who had urged thousands of his supporters to flock to Washington and protest the congressional certification of Joe Biden's victory -- ""bears some responsibility for what happened."" But to ""stir it up again"" could only hurt the country, said Rubio, a presidential candidate beaten by Trump in the 2016 primary. Other Republicans argued that the Senate has no authority to put a private citizen -- as Trump now is -- on trial. Senator Mike Rounds told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the constitution does not allow for the impeachment of a former president. But Senator Mitt Romney, the Republicans' 2012 presidential candidate and a frequent Trump critic, told CNN that ""the preponderance of legal opinion is that an impeachment trial after a president has left office is constitutional. I believe that's the case."" The Utah Republican -- the only member of his party to vote to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial -- hinted that he may be leaning the same way now. He said he believed ""that what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense. If not, what is?"" The Capitol riots were documented on videos seen around the world -- as were Trump's earlier exhortations to the crowd to ""fight"" for his presidency -- complicating his defense. His case may have suffered further after The New York Times reported Friday that Trump had considered ousting the US acting attorney general in favor of a low-ranking official receptive to his efforts to overturn the election result. Biden has publicly taken a hands-off approach to the impeachment, eager to put Trump in the rear-view mirror and seek progress on fighting the coronavirus pandemic and reviving a devastated economy. Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the president ""believes that it's up to the Senate and Congress to determine how they will hold the former president accountable."" As Democrats worked to prepare the case against Trump, one of those who will present it in the Senate -- Representative Madeleine Dean -- said she hoped it would move quickly. ""I would expect it would go faster"" than the 2020 impeachment trial, which lasted 21 days, she told CNN. The trial, however, will be a test for senators: Democrats hope to devote part of each day to regular business, but the furies always surrounding Trump seem sure to undercut any bid for bipartisan cooperation. Dean said she was in the House chamber during the ""terrifying moment"" when the invading mob began pounding on its doors, chanting: ""Hang Vice President Pence."" She said Democrats would demand accountability of Trump for ""an extraordinarily heinous presidential crime."" And Daniel Goldman, who was lead counsel for the House's first impeachment inquiry, tweeted Sunday that ""the only way to ensure this lawless, authoritarian, anti-democratic conduct never happens again is to hold him accountable."" The House of Representatives impeached Trump for a historic second time on January 13, just one week before he left office. The article of impeachment will be delivered and read out to the Senate on Monday at 7:00 pm (0000 GMT Tuesday). The chamber's 100 members will be sworn in as trial jurors the next day. "
"WASHINGTON: Prospects for more aid for Americans struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic and US airlines seeking to avert a wave of layoffs crumbled on Tuesday when President Donald Trump ended negotiations with Congress over a large coronavirus bill. ""I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,"" Trump wrote on Twitter a day after emerging from a hospital stay for COVID-19 treatment. Just days earlier, Trump had urged fast action on a fifth major coronavirus aid bill to augment the more than $3 trillion approved earlier this year. ""OUR GREAT USA WANTS & NEEDS STIMULUS. WORK TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE,"" the Republican president tweeted from the military hospital where he had been undergoing treatment. ...also coming back in record numbers. We are leading the World in Economic Recovery, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1602010127000On Nov. 3, the United States will decide whether Trump wins a second four-year term. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden leads Trump in national opinion polls. In abruptly ending negotiations on another bill to stimulate the economy, Trump insisted that the Senate instead focus exclusively on confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court seat left vacant with last month's death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Barrett's confirmation would cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court. The United States has an estimated 7.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 210,600 deaths, the highest in the world. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who had been cool to a large new aid package, told reporters he supported Trump's move. He said he thought the Republican president believed that a deal with Democrats was not in the offing and that ""we need to concentrate on the achievable."" But Republican Representative John Katko, who is from a New York district that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election, urged Trump to reverse his decision. ""With lives at stake, we cannot afford to stop negotiations on a relief package,"" Katko wrote in a tweet. Another Republican, Senator Susan Collins, who is in a tough re-election race in Maine, said Trump's move was a ""huge mistake."" Among the provisions that were being discussed by House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration were a new round of direct payments to individuals like the $1,200 checks dispatched earlier this year amid huge job losses and a possible new $25 billion bailout of US passenger airlines to keep tens of thousands of workers on the job for another six months. Following Trump's announcement breaking off negotiations, US stocks reversed course to close lower. Shares of major airlines also fell. 'COMPLETE DISARRAY' Pelosi, saying the White House was in ""complete disarray,"" held a call with fellow House Democrats and raised the question of whether a steroid Trump is taking to battle his COVID-19 had clouded his judgment. â'Believe me, there are people ... who think that steroids have an impact on your thinking,'"" Pelosi said, according to a source on the call. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had been talking regularly over the past week as they tried to narrow the gap between a recent Democratic call for around $2.2 trillion in new spending to battle the pandemic and bolster the economy, versus about $1.6 trillion sought by the administration. Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a business conference that failure to provide further relief ""would lead to a weak (economic) recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses."" Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester told CNBC that ""the recovery will continue without it, I think, but it' s going to be a much slower recovery and it's disappointing that we didn't get a package done."" Four weeks before the presidential and congressional elections, opinion polls show that dealing with the pandemic is a top priority of voters, many of whom think filling Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat should wait until after Election Day. In recent days, financial markets had been hopeful that progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine and another round of economic stimulus from Congress would boost the U.S. economy, which has been showing signs of renewed weakness.

"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is confronting the political risk that comes with grand ambition. As one of his first acts, Biden offered a sweeping immigration overhaul last week that would provide a path to US citizenship for the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. It would also codify provisions wiping out some of President Donald Trump's signature hard-line policies, including trying to end existing, protected legal status for many immigrants brought to the US as children and crackdowns on asylum rules. It's precisely the type of measure that many Latino activists have longed for, particularly after the tough approach of the Trump era. But it must compete with Biden's other marquee legislative goals, including a $1.9 trillion plan to combat the coronavirus, an infrastructure package that promotes green energy initiatives and a âpublic optionâ to expand health insurance. In the best of circumstances, enacting such a broad range of legislation would be difficult. But in a narrowly divided Congress, it could be impossible. And that has Latinos, the nation's fastest growing voting bloc, worried that Biden and congressional leaders could cut deals that weaken the finished product too much â or fail to pass anything at all. âThis cannot be a situation where simply a visionary bill â a message bill â gets sent to Congress and nothing happens with it,â said Marielena HincapiÃ©, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for low-income immigrants. âThere's an expectation that they will deliver and that there is a mandate now for Biden to be unapologetically pro-immigrant and have a political imperative to do so, and the Democrats do as well.â If Latinos ultimately feel betrayed, the political consequences for Democrats could be long-lasting. The 2020 election provided several warning signs that, despite Democratic efforts to build a multiracial coalition, Latino support could be at risk. Biden already was viewed skeptically by some Latino activists for his association with former President Barack Obama, who was called the âdeporter in chiefâ for the record number of immigrants who were removed from the country during his administration. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont defeated Biden in last year's Nevada caucuses and California primary, which served as early barometers of the Latino vote. In his race against Trump, Biden won the support of 63% of Latino voters compared with Trump's 35%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide. But Trump narrowed the margin somewhat in some swing states such as Nevada and also got a bump from Latino men, 39% of whom backed him compared with 33% of Latino women. Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1996 to carry Arizona, in part because of strong grassroots backing from Mexican American groups opposed to strict GOP immigration policies going back decades. But he lost Florida by underperforming in its largest Hispanic county, Miami-Dade, where the Trump campaign's anti-socialism message resonated with Cuban- and some Venezuelan Americans. Biden also fell short in Texas even though running mate Kamala Harris devoted valuable, late campaign time there. The ticket lost some sparsely populated but heavily Mexican American counties along the Mexican border, where law enforcement agencies are major employers and the GOP's zero-tolerance immigration policy resonated. There were more warning signs for House Democrats, who lost four California seats and two in South Florida while failing to pick up any in Texas. Booming Hispanic populations reflected in new U.S. census figures may see Texas and Florida gain congressional districts before 2022's midterm elections, which could make correcting the problem all the more pressing for Democrats. The urgency isn't lost on Biden. He privately spent months telling immigration advocates that major overhauls would be at the top of his to-do list. As vice president, he watched while the Obama administration used larger congressional majorities to speed passage of a financial crisis stimulus bill and its signature health care law while letting an immigration overhaul languish. âIt means so much to us to have a new president propose bold, visionary immigration reform on Day 1. Not Day 2. Not Day 3. Not a year later,â said New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, his chamber's lead sponsor of the Biden package. Menendez was part of a bipartisan immigration plan championed by the âGang of Eightâ senators that collapsed in 2013. Obama then resorted to executive action to offer legal status to millions of young immigrants. President George W. Bush also pushed an immigration package â with an eye toward boosting Latino support for Republicans before the 2008 election â only to see it fail in Congress. Menendez acknowledged that the latest bill will have to find at least 10 Republican senators' support to clear the 60-vote hurdle to reach the floor, and that he's âunder no illusions"" how difficult that will be. Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from Florida, said Biden may find some GOP support but probably will have to settle for far less than what's in his original proposal. âMany Republicans are worried about primary challenges,â Curbelo said, adding that Trump and his supporters' championing of immigration crackdowns means there's âpolitical peril there for Republicans.â "
"WASHINGTON: There was no distribution plan for the coronavirus vaccine set up by the Trump administration as the virus raged in the their last months in office, new President Joe Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said on Sunday. ""The process to distribute the vaccine, particularly outside of nursing homes and hospitals out into the community as a whole, did not really exist when we came into the White House,"" Klain said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" "
"In the race to the bottom for the title of worst American president, the same few sorry names appear at the end of almost every list, jockeying for last place. Thereâs Andrew Johnson, whose abysmal behavior during Reconstruction led to the first presidential impeachment. Thereâs Warren G. Harding, responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal. Thereâs hapless, hated Franklin Pierce; doomed, dead-after-32-days William Henry Harrison; and inevitably, James Buchanan, often considered worst of all because of how badly he bungled the lead-up to the Civil War. But as historians consider the legacy of Donald Trump, it appears that even the woefully inadequate Buchanan has some serious competition for the spot at the bottom. âTrump was the first president to be impeached twice and the first to stir up a mob to try to attack the Capitol and disrupt his successor from becoming president,â said Eric Rauchway, professor of history at the University of California, Davis. âThese will definitely go down in history books, and they are not good.â âI already feel that he is the worst,â said Ted Widmer, professor of history at the City University of New York, noting that as bad as Buchanan was â and he was very bad indeed â he was ânot as aggressively bad as Trump.â âAndrew Johnson and Nixon would be the two others in the worst category, and I think Trump has them beat pretty handily, too,â he added. âHe has invented a whole new category, a subbasement that no one knew existed.â Presidential ranking may be a water cooler exercise for historians, but it is also an official institutional pursuit. The Siena College Research Institute regularly compiles ranked lists of all the American presidents, based on the composite views of scholars. So does C-SPAN. Various polls periodically ask regular citizens to weigh in. And on Twitter last week, Chris Hayes of MSNBC took the presidential-ranking parlor game to his followers, asking them to list the âfive worst presidents of all time.â (He put Trump as the second worst, just after Johnson.) Trump was a highly divisive president, of course, and one of the confounding things about him was how two people could look at his behavior and make completely different assessments. But not so much anymore. âI would say that before the election it depended on oneâs political outlook,â with conservatives applauding his tax cuts, deregulation policies and judicial appointments, said William Cooper Jr., professor emeritus of history at Louisiana State University. âBut from the election forward, I donât see how anyone could feel that Trumpâs behavior was anything but reprehensible or that he hasnât completely destroyed any legacy he would have left.â He cited Trumpâs refusal to concede the election; his promotion of baseless conspiracy theories attacking voting integrity; his intemperate, self-promoting behavior during the Georgia Senate runoffs, which helped ensure victory for the two Democratic candidates; and his encouragement of the crowd that rioted at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Even conservatives from Atlanta, where Cooper lives, have had it with Trump, he said. âHe has tarred and feathered himself, and I think it will blemish him for a long, long, long time.â Douglas Brinkley, professor of history at Rice University and a member of the advisory panel for C-SPANâs Presidential Historians Survey, said that Trump âwas a bad president in just about every regard.â âI find him to be the worst president in U.S. history, personally,â Brinkley said, âeven worse than William Henry Harrison, who was president for only one month. You donât want to be ranked below him.â Brinkley brought up Richard Nixon, the only president to resign in disgrace. âAt least when Nixon left, he put the country ahead of himself at the last minute,â Brinkley said. âNow he looks like a statesman compared to Trump.â These are all hot takes, of course â the sound of Frank Sinatraâs âMy Way,â the song playing Wednesday as Trump flew out of Washington, has barely faded from our ears â and it is too soon to know how history will judge him. But things do not augur well, said Don Levy, director of Sienaâs research institute. In the most recent Siena survey, a year into the Trump administration, Trump was rated 42nd out of 44 presidents, less terrible than only Buchanan and Johnson. In almost every category â integrity, intelligence and relationship with Congress, for instance â he was rated at or nearly rock bottom. (The exceptions: He was 25th in âwilling to take risksâ and 10th in âluck.â) âSpeaking in terms of this survey, it would be surprising if Trump was meaningfully rehabilitated,â Levy said. âIf the opening paragraph of any discussion starts about being impeached twice, and the second sentence is about the coronavirus, and the third is about partisanship, thatâs going to be very hard to overcome.â Sean Wilentz, a professor of American history at Princeton University, said that Trump was the worst president in history, hands down. âHeâs in a whole other category in terms of the damage heâs done to the Republic,â said Wilentz, citing the radicalization of the Republican Party, the inept response to the pandemic and what he called âthe brazen, almost psychedelic mendacity of the man.â Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose most recent book, âLeadership: In Turbulent Times,â looks at how four presidents confronted tough moments in history, said that it normally takes a generation to evaluate a leader. But to the extent that a presidentâs legacy is determined by his ability to rise to a crisis, Trump will be remembered for his failures: how poorly he handled COVID-19 and how disgracefully he behaved after the election. âHistory will look with grave disfavor on President Trump for the crisis he created,â she said. For his part, Rauchway said he believed that Trump would âcrash the bottom fiveâ on the presidential rankings but that the bottom spot itself was uncertain. âI think he has some stiff competitionâ in Johnson, whom Rauchway personally regards as the worst president of all. âIf I had to predict where historiography would go, I think people would have to recognize that Trumpism â nativism and white supremacy â has deep roots in American history,â Rauchway said. âBut Trump himself put it to new and malignant purpose.â Robert Strauss, a journalist and the author of âWorst. President. Ever.,â a popular history of Buchanan, seemed reluctant to allow the subject of his book to relinquish his title. âI can go through a litany of things that Buchanan did,â he said. âIn the time period between Lincolnâs election and the inaugurationâ â that is, during the lame-duck period of Buchananâs presidency â âhe let seven states secede and said, âI canât do anything about it.â He also influenced the Dred Scott decision, the worst decision in Supreme Court history.â Of course, âthe difference was that Buchanan was a nice guy,â Strauss said. âHe was the greatest party-giver of the 19th century. He was kind to his nieces and nephews. What he was, was not a very good president.â As they considered Trumpâs record in comparison to that of other presidents, some historians said that he could have done things to salvage his reputation. âIf he had presided over a competent response to COVID, he would have won reelection easily,â Widmer of the City University of New York said. âAnd if he had responded with grace to his loss, a lot of people would have given him some grudging respect.â And yes, he added, Trump was worse than Buchanan. âTrump is a worse failure because he really wanted to be reelected, and he was rejected,â Widmer said. âBuchanan colossally failed, but at least he had the dignity not to run again.â "
"WASHINGTON: The American far right is angry: Angry at Joe Biden, angry at Donald Trump, angry at the enigmatic ""Q"" and angry with themselves. The online postings and chatrooms of extremists have been brimming with disappointment and dissent since the failed January 6 insurrection against Congress and the inauguration of Joe Biden as president. Followers of the QAnon conspiracy movement -- and its Delphic prophet Q -- are most in disarray, their millenarian predictions of chaos and doom accompanying Biden's elevation to the presidency not (or not yet) coming true. Ultranationalists like the Proud Boys, armed militias such as the Oath Keepers, and dangerous white supremacists and neo-Nazis have been pushed further underground, with followers who took part in the Capitol attack being swept up by law enforcement. Experts in extremism and domestic terrorism say these groups have been dealt a blow by Trump's exit from power. But they also maintain that the groups are not disappearing, and in some ways are now more motivated toward undertaking more dangerous attacks. The more extreme groups are looking at the large pool of disheartened QAnon types for recruits, they say. ""The rhetoric remains heated, people are not cooling off. They are not adjusting well to Biden,"" said Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which researches extremism. Far from depleted, said Colin P. Clarke, Director of Policy and Research at The Soufan Group, ""the energy and momentum that the far right has is stronger than any time in recent memory. ""The question is, what happens next?"" Many expected that Trump's exit and the expulsion of extremists from Facebook, Twitter, Parler and other social media would calm things. Instead, it has added to the furor and galvanized the disparate far-right groups. ""They are far more united in what they are against than what they are for"" said Clarke. Hayden said the deplatforming by social media companies of users they consider beyond the pale is ""becoming a unifying grievance."" Most have relocated to a few welcoming platforms, foremost Telegram, where new QAnon and Proud Boys pages have hundreds of thousands of followers. ""The infrastructure really still exists"" for the far right to convene, said Hayden. QAnon began in late 2017 with cryptic statements from the mysterious Q on the 8kun website. No one knew who Q was, but his statements mobilized Trump followers to believe there was a Democratic and ""deep state"" plot against the president. As time passed they absorbed other conspiracy theories, including one about a global child kidnapping racket, and bizarre end-of-times predictions. And Trump's tweets, campaigns and rallies became a focal point for Q followers. After his election defeat, they gave momentum to his ""Stop the Steal"" campaign centered on the false claim that Biden's victory was somehow fraudulent. That led directly to the January 6 Washington insurrection in Trump's name that left five dead. But Biden's inauguration Wednesday and Trump's quiet departure to Florida closed that door. Many are even angry that Trump hasn't clearly defended the more than 120 who arrested and hundreds more under investigation for the Capitol attack. But the far right ""is coming to terms with"" his departure and regrouping without him, said Hayden. QAnon followers though were dealt a second shock. On Wednesday Ron Watkins, whose father controls 8kun and who many believe is or knows the real ""Q,"" announced he was quitting the movement and wiped out all of 8kun's QAnon archives. ""We gave it our all. Now we need to keep our chins up and go back to our lives as best as we are able,"" he posted on Telegram. ""We have a new president sworn in and it is our responsibility as citizens to respect the Constitution."" ""That was a massive body-blow to the movement,"" said Karim Zidan, an investigator for Right Wing Watch. But Zidan said the movement has proven it can live without Q. QAnon ""influencers"" with tens of thousands of followers, and the public figures who drove Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" campaign, like attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell and ex-national security advisor Michael Flynn, are inspiring the movement to continue. Wood, for example, picked up 592,000 followers in just one week after moving to Telegram, said Zidan. Powell has some 300,000. Worrying is the potential for moderate QAnon and Proud Boys followers to be ""radicalized"" online by more violent right-wing extremists. They only have to peel off a small portion from those groups to build networks capable of destructive violence, noted Clarke. ""There are people out there committed to attacks,"" he said. He compared the level of anger to the early 1990s, which saw several domestic attacks including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 165, by anti-government extremists. ""The possibility for violence remains high,"" said Hayden. "
"WASHINGTON: Democrats plan to move quickly on one of the first bills of the new Congress, citing the need for federal election standards and other reforms to shore up the foundations of American democracy after a tumultuous post-election period and deadly riot at the Capitol. States have long had disparate and contradictory rules for running elections. But the 2020 election, which featured pandemic-related changes to ease voting and then a flood of lawsuits by former President Donald Trump and his allies, underscored the differences from state to state: Mail-in ballots due on Election Day or just postmarked by then? Absentee voting allowed for all or just voters with an excuse? Same-day or advance-only registration? Democrats, asserting constitutional authority to set the time, place and manner of federal elections, want national rules they say would make voting more uniform, accessible and fair across the nation. The bill would mandate early voting, same-day registration and other long-sought reforms that Republicans reject as federal overreach. âWe have just literally seen an attack on our own democracy,â said U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, referring to the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol. âI cannot think of a more timely moment to start moving on democracy reform.â The legislation first introduced two years ago, known as the For the People Act, also would give independent commissions the job of drawing congressional districts, require political groups to disclose high-dollar donors, create reporting requirements for online political ads and, in a rearview nod at Trump, obligate presidents to disclose their tax returns. Republican opposition was fierce during the last session. At the time, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., labeled it the âDemocrat Politician Protection Actâ and said in an op-ed that Democrats were seeking to âchange the rules of American politics to benefit one party.â While Democrats control Congress for the first time in a decade, the measure's fate depends on whether enough Republicans can be persuaded to reconsider a bill they have repeatedly rejected. If not, Democrats could decide it's time to take the extraordinary and difficult step of eliminating the Senate filibuster, a procedural tool often used by the minority party to block bills under rules that require 60 votes to advance legislation. Advocates say the bill is the most consequential piece of voting legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965. House Democrats vowed two years ago to make the bill a priority, and they reintroduced it this month as H.R. 1, underscoring its importance to the party. âPeople just want to be able to cast their vote without it being an ordeal,â said Rep. John Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland who is the lead sponsor of the House bill. âIt's crazy in America that you still have to navigate an obstacle course to get to the ballot box.â Current plans would have the full House take up the bill as soon as the first week of February. The Senate Rules Committee would then consider a companion bill introduced in the Senate, and a tie vote there could allow it to move out of committee and to the floor as early as next month, said Klobuchar, who is expected to become the committee's next chair. A quick vote would be remarkable considering the Senate also is likely to be juggling Trump's impeachment trial, confirmation of President Joe Biden's Cabinet choices and another round of coronavirus relief. While states have long had different voting procedures, the November 2020 election highlighted how the variability could be used to sow doubt about the outcome. The bill's supporters, which include national voting and civil rights organizations, cited dozens of pre-election lawsuits that challenged procedural rules, such as whether ballots postmarked on Election Day should count. They also pointed to the post-election litigation Trump and his allies filed to try to get millions of legitimately cast ballots tossed out. Many of those lawsuits targeted election changes intended to make voting easier. That included a Pennsylvania law the state's Republican-led legislature passed before the pandemic to make absentee ballots available to all registered voters upon request. Government and election officials repeatedly have described the election as the most secure in U.S. history. Even former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, a Trump ally, said before leaving his post that there was no evidence of widespread fraud that would overturn the result. âThe strategy of lying about voter fraud, delegitimising the election outcome and trying to suppress votes has been unmasked for the illegitimate attack on our democracy that it is, and I think that it opens a lot more doors to real conversations about how to fix our voting system and root out this cancer,â said Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy institute. Along with the election reform bill, the House two years ago introduced a related bill, now known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in honor of the late civil rights activist and congressman. House Democrats are expected to reintroduce it soon after it had similarly stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. "
"OTTAWA: Canada's Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden plan to meet next month, the prime minister's office said on Friday, following a call between the two leaders in which they agreed to join forces to combat coronavirus in North America. Trudeau, who has been keen to embrace the new president and turn the page on the often tumultuous Donald Trump years, was the first foreign leader to speak with Biden since Wednesday's inauguration. ""They discussed collaboration on vaccines and acknowledged that the two countriesâ efforts are strengthened by existing exchanges of medical personnel and the flow of critical medical supplies,"" according to a read out of the call. The two also agreed to expand cooperation on continental defence and in the Arctic, and said their respective top defence and foreign affairs would be meet at the earliest opportunity. Trudeau earlier on Friday hailed Biden's arrival as a ""new era"" for bilateral ties but the relationship has begun with an early disagreement after Biden scrapped the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the United States on his first day in office on Wednesday. Pipeline builder TC Energy Corp said it would eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs in coming weeks due to the cancellation. ""The prime minister raised Canadaâs disappointment with the United Statesâ decision on the Keystone XL pipeline,"" according to the read out, which noted that Trudeau also brought up the ""the importance of the softwood lumber industry, and urged the removal of duties."" The long-running dispute saw the Trump administration impose tariffs against what it saw as unfair subsidies for Canadian exporters of softwood lumber, which is used in home construction. "
"WASHINGTON: Former US President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial will begin during the week of February 8, Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer announced. The process will start on Monday when the US House of Representatives formally delivers the impeachment charge to the chamber. The chamber charged Trump with inciting an insurrection against the government on January 6. ""We all want to put this awful chapter in our nation's history behind us. But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability and that is what this trial will provide,"" CNN quoted Schumer as saying. Senate leaders struck a deal on Friday to delay former President Donald J. Trump's impeachment trial for two weeks, giving President Biden time to install his cabinet and begin moving a legislative agenda before they begin a historic proceeding to try his predecessor for ""incitement of insurrection."" On January 13, one week before Biden took office, the lower chamber in the US Congress voted 232-197 to impeach Trump on charges of inciting violence against the US government. Although Trump is no longer president, the Senate could still convict him and vote to ban him from ever running for office again. It was the second time Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House. The first time he was acquitted by the Senate in February of last year (with only 1 Republican voting in favor of one article of impeachment). However, unlike the impeachment over the Ukraine aid scandal, GOP House lawmakers broke rank--with ten voting to impeach Trump. It will take 67 votes in the 100-seat Senate to convict Trump on the impeachment charges. This would require 17 GOP senators to break rank "
"WASHINGTON: The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives will deliver an impeachment charge against former President Donald Trump to the Senate on Monday, rejecting Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's request for a delay. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who displaced McConnell as the chamber's leader after Democrats won two Georgia runoff elections this month, announced the move on the Senate floor on Friday. Schumer did not say when Trump's second impeachment trial would begin. But he emphasized the need to move quickly on confirmation of President Joe Biden's Cabinet and other key administration officials. ""The House will deliver the article of impeachment to the Senate. The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial,"" Schumer said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed the plan in a statement. His remarks came the morning after McConnell asked the House to delay sending the charges until next Thursday, and called on Schumer to postpone the trial until mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare a defense against the charge that he incited an insurrection by his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. ""This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process over in the House,"" McConnell said on Friday. ""The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages the Senate or the presidency itself."" Senate rules call for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 p.m. on the day after articles of impeachment are delivered to the upper legislative chamber of Congress, except for Sundays. But Senator Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC that lawmakers would ""sit down and map this out as best we can, use every available minute."" The moves come as Schumer and McConnell are struggling to assert control in a 50-50 chamber where Democrats hold a razor-thin majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote. ""I can't imagine that both McConnell and Schumer don't want to have a little more structure here, and particularly Schumer, leave a little more time to move forward with the early Biden decisions before we get locked into the trial,"" Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters. McConnell has insisted that Democrats provide a guarantee that they will not end the legislative filibuster, which gives the minority Republicans the power to block legislation being pushed by the new Biden administration. Schumer rejected McConnell's demand on Friday, calling it an ""unacceptable proposal."" McConnell refused to concede, saying that maintaining the filibuster's 60-vote threshold for advancing most legislation was a linchpin for the power-sharing agreement cobbled together in 2001, the last time the Senate was split 50-50. Both the trial and the battle over Senate operations could distract from Biden's efforts to push an ambitious legislative agenda through Congress, including nearly $2 trillion in fresh Covid-19 relief for Americans and US businesses, as well as the need to confirm his Cabinet nominees. Trump last week became the first president in US history to be impeached twice, and when the Senate convenes for his trial will be the first president tried after leaving office, for his alleged role in urging his supporters to storm the Capitol in an attack that left five dead. Ten House Republicans joined Democrats on Jan. 13 in impeaching him. The support of at least 17 Senate Republicans would be needed to convict him; a separate vote would then be needed to ban him from running for office again. Such a vote could signal that senior Republicans were eager to remove Trump as the de facto leader of their party; he has said he may seek to run again in 2024. Trump's fate ultimately could depend on McConnell, whose position is likely to influence other Republican lawmakers. The Kentucky Republican said this week that the mob was ""fed lies"" and ""provoked by the president and other powerful people."" "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump is doing ""very well"" in his hospital treatment for Covid-19, his medics said Saturday, but a source with knowledge of the US president's condition said his vital signs had been worrying, with the next 48 hours critical. Trump is up and walking, has been fever free for 24 hours and his cough, nasal congestion and fatigue are improving, physician Sean Conley said during the first medical update on his status since the president was admitted to Walter Reed military medical center Friday. Trump is not receiving extra oxygen, he added, and is ""doing very well."" ""We have monitored his cardiac function, his kidney function, liver function. All of those are normal,"" another member of the medical team, Sean Dooley said. But a source familiar with the president's health gave a much more worrying assessment. ""The president's vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care,"" the source said. ""We're still not on a clear path to a full recovery."" The White House has not commented on the assessment. Conley was evasive when asked whether Trump had received supplementary oxygen at any point since falling ill, only confirming that he hadn't received any at the hospital or on Thursday- the day he had his test. This leaves the possibility that he was on oxygen at the White House on Friday before being admitted to Walter Reed, and there were reports in US media, unconfirmed by AFP, that this was the case. Soon after Trump arrived at hospital, Conley said in a memo that the president was starting a course of therapeutic drug remdesivir and had received an eight-gram dose of an experimental polyclonal antibody cocktail. Conley would not put a ""hard date"" on Trump's discharge from hospital or disclose the president's temperature. Amid the rosy assessment from the White House, more people close to the president disclosed they have tested positive for the coronavirus. The latest is campaign advisor Chris Christie, who was among several aides that helped Trump prepare for the first presidential debate that have since announced positive tests. Three senators as well as Trump's campaign manager and other senior aides are among a growing list from the president's orbit to have contracted the virus, with at least seven confirmed cases tied to an event in the White House Rose Garden last weekend. With Trump, who is trailing in the polls, knocked off the campaign trail for treatment Walter Reed army medical center outside Washington -- and possibly for many days after- his campaign plans were in disarray ahead of a potentially messy election on November 3. Among the unknowns were the prospects for two remaining presidential debates and whether the president will have to yield power temporarily to Vice President Mike Pence if his condition worsens. ""Going well, I think! Thank you to all. Love!!!"" Trump said in his first tweet from the hospital late Friday. He had walked out of the White House under his own steam- and wearing a mask, which is rare for the world's most prominent pandemic skeptic- to be taken to the hospital. The president- a prolific tweeter- stayed off social media almost all day Friday. Heightening the sense of crisis at the heart of power in America, a third Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced on Saturday that he had tested positive. Former White House top aide Kellyanne Conway and Trump's campaign manager, 42-year-old Bill Stepien, have contracted the novel coronavirus. So have two other Republican senators -- Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah. The latter two sit on the chamber's Judiciary Committee, which is slated to hold hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's conservative nominee to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Public health experts have expressed alarm at the number of cases that appear linked to a celebration of Barrett's nomination at the Rose Garden on September 26. At least seven people who attended have now tested positive, including Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, Conway, Tillis, Lee and University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins. These are uncharted waters for the US election with Trump -- who is well behind his Democratic opponent Joe Biden in the polls -- having to freeze much of his campaign. Biden now finds himself alone on the campaign trail -- and able to argue that his more cautious approach to Covid-19 has been vindicated. Biden has made Trump's frequent downplaying of the pandemic and mixed messaging on mask-wearing a central campaign theme, while Trump has tried to shift the narrative to areas where he feels stronger, like the economy. The former vice president, who stood on a stage with Trump for 90 minutes during their ill-tempered first debate Tuesday, announced that he and his wife Jill tested negative Friday. Underlining his sudden advantage in the bitter race, Biden, 77, traveled to Grand Rapids, Michigan on Friday, going ahead with a previously scheduled campaign stop. However, Biden also reminded voters that he has pushed consistently for a serious approach to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 208,000 Americans, unlike his opponent who has mocked the Democrat for his rigorous use of masks. "
"WASHINGTON: Facebook has asked its independent experts to take a decision on continuation of its ban on former US President Donald Trump. Facebook and its photo and video sharing social networking service, Instagram, suspended Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 that left five people dead and led to his second impeachment. The Oversight Board, an independent body created by Facebook three years ago, on Thursday said it has accepted a case referral from the social media giant to examine its decision to indefinitely suspend Trump's access to post content on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook has also requested policy recommendations from the board on suspensions when the user is a political leader. Facebook's decision to suspend Trump's access to post on Facebook and Instagram has driven intense global interest. The Oversight Board has been closely following events in the US and Facebook's response to them, and the board is ready to provide a thorough and independent assessment of the company's decision, it said. ""A decision by the Board on this case will be binding on Facebook, and determine whether Mr Trump's suspension from access to Facebook and Instagram for an indefinite amount of time is overturned,â the board said in a press release. Facebook has committed not to restore access to its platforms unless directed by a decision of the Oversight Board. Facebook must consider any accompanying policy recommendations from the board and publicly respond to them, it said. According to the Oversight Board, in the coming days, the case will be assigned to a five-member case review panel. After the panel reaches a decision, its findings are shared with the entire board. Sign-off by a majority of the board is required for a case decision to be issued. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has no plans to call his predecessor Donald Trump, the White House has said. âThere's no call planned,â White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. She was responding to questions on the remarks made by Biden a day earlier when he said that Trump has left him a ""very generous"" letter in the Oval Office, and he plans to talk to him. Trump did not attend his inauguration, a rare for an outgoing president. âWhat he was conveying is that he didn't want to release a private note without having agreement from the former president. But I wouldn't say he's seeking it through a phone call, he was just trying to be respectful in that moment of a private letter that was sent,â Psaki said. It is customary for outgoing presidents to write their successors a letter and leave it for them on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. However, given that the former president broke several of the past traditions, including skipping Biden's inauguration ceremony and never formally congratulated him on his election win, it was unclear until Wednesday whether Trump would maintain the tradition of outgoing presidents leaving notes for their successors. ""The president wrote a very generous letter. Because it was private, I will not talk about it until I talk to him. But it was generous,"" Biden had told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is experiencing 'mild symptoms' of Covid-19 after revealing Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the coronavirus, a stunning announcement that plunges the country deeper into uncertainty just a month before the presidential election. Trump, who has spent much of the year downplaying the threat of a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans, said he and Mrs. Trump were quarantining. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties 'without disruption' while recovering. A White House official said Friday morning that the president was experiencing mild symptoms but was working from the White House residence. Trump's diagnosis was sure to have a destabilizing effect in Washington and around the world, raising questions about how far the virus had spread through the highest levels of the US government. Hours before Trump announced he had contracted the virus, the White House said a top aide who had traveled with him during the week had tested positive. ""Tonight, (at)FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,"" Trump tweeted just before 1 a.m. ""We will get through this TOGETHER!"" Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately.â¦ https://t.co/CIIB2LDQtr— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1601614446000Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus on Friday morning and ""remains in good health,"" his spokesman said. Many White House and senior administration officials were undergoing tests Friday, but the full scale of the outbreak around the president may not be known for some time as it can take days for an infection to be detectable by a test. Officials with the White House Medical Unit were still in the process of tracing the president's contacts, the official said. Trump was last seen by reporters returning to the White House on Thursday evening and did not appear visibly ill. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide. The president's physician said in a memo that Trump and the first lady, who is 50, ""are both well at this time"" and ""plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence."" The diagnosis marks a devastating blow for a president who has been trying desperately to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is behind them. In the best of cases, if he develops no symptoms, which can include fever, cough and breathing trouble, it will likely force him off the campaign trail just weeks before the election and puts his participation in the second presidential debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, into doubt. Trump's handling of the pandemic has already been a major flashpoint in his race against Democrat Joe Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware because of the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at Tuesday night's debate. ""I don't wear masks like him,"" Trump said of Biden. ""Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen."" In a tweet Friday morning, Biden said he and his wife ""send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family."" Vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her husband tweeted similar sentiments. Coronavirus: Donald Trump and First Lady Melania test positiveIt was not immediately clear whether the former vice president had been tested since appearing at the debate with Trump or whether he was taking any additional safety protocols. Trump and Biden did not shake hands during the debate, but stood without masks about 10 feet apart for the 90-minute event. World leaders offered the president and first family their best wishes after their diagnosis, as governments used their case as a reminder for their citizens to wear masks and practice social distancing measures. On Friday, Trump had been scheduled to receive an intelligence briefing, attend a fundraiser and hold another campaign rally in Sanford, Florida. But just after 1 a.m., the White House released a revised schedule with only one event: a phone call on ""Covid-19 support to vulnerable seniors."" Trump's announcement came hours after he confirmed that Hope Hicks, one of his most trusted and longest-serving aides, had been diagnosed with the virus Thursday. Hicks began feeling mild symptoms during the plane ride home from a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday evening, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private information. She was isolated from other passengers aboard the plane, the person said. Hicks had been with Trump and other senior staff aboard Marine One and Air Force One en route to that rally and had accompanied the president to Tuesday's presidential debate in Cleveland, along with members of the Trump family. The Trump contingent removed their masks during the debate, in violation of the venue rules. Multiple White House staffers have previously tested positive for the virus, including Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, national security adviser Robert O'Brien and one of the president's personal valets. But Trump has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable, even after White House staff and allies were exposed and sickened. Since the coronavirus emerged earlier this year, Trump has refused to abide by basic public health guidelines- including those issued by his own administration _ such as wearing face coverings in public and practicing social distancing. Instead, he has continued to hold campaign rallies that draw thousands of often mask-less supporters. ""I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,"" he told reporters back in May. The news was sure to rattle an already shaken nation still grappling with how to safely reopen the economy without driving virus transmission. The White House has access to near-unlimited resources, including a constant supply of quick-result tests, and still failed to keep the president safe, raising questions about how the rest of the country will be able to protect its workers, students and the public as businesses and schools reopen. US stock futures fell on the news of Trump's diagnosis. Questions remain about why it took so long for Trump to be tested and why he and his aides continued to come to work and travel after Hicks fell ill. Trump traveled to New Jersey on Thursday for a fundraiser, potentially exposing attendees to the virus. Trump's social media director Dan Scavino and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who were originally set to join him on the trip, were replaced at the last minute by other aides. McEnany briefed the press Thursday morning while Hicks was presumed to have the virus, but offered no public word on the case close to the president. It is unclear where the Trumps and Hicks may have caught the virus, but in his Fox interview, Trump seemed to suggest it may have been spread by someone in the military or law enforcement. ""It's very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement, and they come over to you, and they want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,"" he said, ""because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close. And things happen."" Several members of Trump's Cabinet were undergoing testing for Covid-19 Friday. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo, the fourth in line to the presidency, tested negative shortly before he landed in Croatia. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin also tested negative, while attorney general William Barr was to undergo a test Friday morning. The White House began instituting a daily testing regimen for the president's senior aides after earlier positive cases close to the president. Anyone in close proximity to the president or vice president is also tested every day, including reporters. Yet since the early days of the pandemic, experts have questioned the health and safety protocols at the White House and asked why more wasn't being done to protect the commander in chief. Trump continued to shake hands with visitors long after public health officials were warning against it, and he initially resisted being tested. Trump is far from the first world leader to test positive for the virus, which previously infected Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hospitalized last month while fighting what he called a ``hellish'' case of COVID-19. While there is currently no indication that Trump is seriously ill, the positive test raises questions about what would happen if he were to become incapacitated due to illness. The Constitution's 25th Amendment spells out the procedures under which the president can declare himself ""unable to discharge the powers and duties"" of the presidency. If he were to make that call, Trump would transmit a written note to the Senate president pro tempore, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pence would serve as acting president until Trump transmitted ""a written declaration to the contrary."" The vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or another body established by law can also declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, in which case Pence would ""immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President"" until Trump could provide a written declaration to the contrary.

"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump, who for months dismissed and downplayed the coronavirus pandemic, and who sneered at and smeared everyone promoting mitigation measures to combat the disease and tempted fate with close contact political rallies and meetings, has tested positive for the virus. ""Tonight, @FLOTUS (Melania Trump) and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!""

Self-quarantine means Trump, 74, who had airily waved off criticism of his in-person political rallies dubbed ""super-spreader events,"" will have to forego such gatherings. More importantly, if the virus incapacitates him, then vice-president Mike Pence â who has tested negative for the virus --will have to take over the Presidency. If he too is stricken, the mantle passes on to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, under the order of succession provided by the U.S constitution. There is also the Trump's personal responsibility (or lack of it) and liability to the extent he may have spread the virus, and how the public -- and the electorate -- will react to it. The US President repeatedly predicted the virus is going to disappear and it will be gone one day like a miracle. He also ridiculed and challenged pandemic experts and health/medical professionals, saying they were mistaken on the severity of the situation -- all the while disdaining masks and social distancing, promoting random remedies, and urging school and businesses to open. As recently as Tuesday, Trump mocked his Democratic challenger Joe Biden for wearing a mask all the time and not going out and campaigning like he is. ""I don't wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen,â Trump sneered at Biden during the debate."" Biden rose above the gibe in responding to news about Trump being Covid+ve. ""Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family,"" he tweeted. The US President scrubbed plans to fly to Florida for a campaign rally on Friday, and his schedule for the day listed only a midday telephone call ""on Covid-19 support to vulnerable seniors."" It is not clear just yet if he will be up for the second Presidential debate in Miami on October15. Questions also arose on when the President and the White House knew of Hope Hicks infection and whether rallies, meetings, and fundraisers were scheduled even after that. There was a flurry of Covid tests among people who met Trump over the past week â including Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who tested negative. Everyone in and around the White House is suddenly wearing masks after the President and his entourage frequently disdained it on grounds that they were being tested regularly. For some, it was too late. Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, a Trump loyalist, was among those who tested positive for the virus, although it was not clear if it was because of contact with the White House. As good wishes for a quick recovery for Trumps poured in from across the world â Indiaâs prime minister Narendra Modi was among the first to message â needling exchanges erupted in the domestic sphere with scores of commentators pointing to the grim irony of the virus getting to the President who had dismissed it repeatedly. From invoking Karma to God, critics of the President gloated over the developments, while others recalled their own travails with the virus that Trump dismissed. ""So I guess the hydroxychloroquine didn't work as a preventative?"" sneered one critic; another tweeted: ""I hold extreme resentment and anger to a man who sat idly by as all of us, including myself, lost my father and loved ones as he insisted 1) it was a hoax 2) it would magically disappear and 3) that people who wore masks were fools."" One trending hashtag on Twitter: ""It is what it is"" â a reference to Trumpâs airy dismissal of the Covid-19 death toll. Meanwhile, his supporters prayed for him. Many took comfort from the fact that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson recovered from Covid-19. Others expected the President to come roaring back after a 14-day quarantine. "

"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19, he said in a tweet early on Friday. ""We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,"" he said. Trump's positive test comes just hours after the White House announced that senior aide Hope Hicks came down with the virus after traveling with the president several times this week. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has now killed more than 200,000 people nationwide. ""Tonight, (at)FLOTUS and I tested positive for Covid-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!"" Trump tweeted.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1601614446000The diagnosis marks a major blow for a president who has been trying desperately to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is behind them even as cases continue to rise with less than four months before Election Day. And it stands as the most serious known public health scare encountered by any sitting American president in recent history. Symptoms of Covid-19 can include fever, cough and breathing trouble. Most people develop only mild symptoms. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal. In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity Thursday, Trump said he was awaiting results of a Covid-19 test. ""Whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don't know,'' he said, adding that first lady Melania Trump was also awaiting results. Hicks traveled with the president multiple times this week, including aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, and on Air Force One to a rally in Minnesota Wednesday, and aboard Air Force One to Tuesday night's first presidential debate in Cleveland. Trump had consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable to contracting Covid-19, even after White House staff and allies were exposed and sickened. ""I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,'' he said told reporters back in May. He has instead encouraged governors to reopen their states and tried to focus the nation's attention on efforts to revive the economy - not a growing death toll - as he seeks another four-year term. Some studies suggest Covid-19 patients who are obese may be at higher risk of being seriously sicked by the virus, although it's unclear whether that's because they are more likely to have other health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. In his 2019 physical, Trump met the technical threshold for obesity. The news was sure to rattle an already shaken nation still grappling with how to safely reopen while avoiding further spikes. The White House has access to near-unlimited resources, including a constant supply of quick-result tests, and still failed to keep the president safe, raising questions about how the rest of the country will be able to protect its workers, students and the public as businesses and schools reopen. Trump, the vice president and other senior staff have been tested for Covid-19 daily since two people who work at the White House complex tested positive in early May, prompting the White House to step up precautions. Everyone who comes into contact with the president also receives a quick-result test. Yet since the early days of the pandemic, experts have questioned the health and safety protocols at the White House and asked why more wasn't being done to protect the commander in chief. Trump continued to shake hands with visitors long after public health officials were warning against it and he initially resisted being tested. He has been reluctant to practice his own administration's social distancing guidelines for fear of looking weak, including refusing under almost all circumstances to wear a mask in public. Trump is not the only major world leader known to have contracted the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel self-isolated after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the virus, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked from home after his wife fell ill. The White House got its first Covid-19 scare in early March when at least three people who later tested positive came in close proximity to the president at his private Florida club. That included members of the Brazilian president's delegation, including the Brazilian charge d'affaires, who sat at Trump's dinner table. In mid-March, as the virus continued to spread across the country, the White House began taking the temperature of everyone entering the White House complex, and in April, it began administering rapid Covid-19 tests to all those in close proximity to the president, with staffers being tested about once a week. The frequent tests gave some staff the false impression the complex was safe from the virus, and few, as a result, followed recommended safety protocols, including wearing masks. But then the bubble broke. On May 7, the White House announced that a member of the military serving as one of the president's personal valets tested positive for the virus, followed a day later by a positive diagnosis for Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary. Even then, Trump said he was ""not worried'' about the virus spreading in the White House. But officials again stepped up safety protocols for the complex, directing everyone entering the West Wing to wear a mask. ""I think it's very well contained, actually,'' Trump told reporters on May 11. But by June, concerns at the White House had dissipated once again, with few staffers bothering with masks even as more and more people tested positive for the virus, including campaign staffers preparing for a Tulsa rally and Secret Service agents. On July 3rd, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive in South Dakota before an Independence Day fireworks show at Mount Rushmore. Guilfoyle, a former Fox News personality who works for Trump's campaign, had not flown on Air Force One and had not been in direct contact with the president, though she had had contact with numerous top GOP officials. In July, Trump National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien tested positive. While there is no evidence that Trump is seriously ill, the positive test also raises questions about what would happen if he were to become incapacitated due to illness. The Constitution's 25th Amendment spells out the procedures under which a president can declare themselves ""unable to discharge the powers and duties'' of the presidency. If he were to make that call, Trump would transmit a written note to the Senate president pro tempore, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pence would serve as acting president until Trump transmitted ""a written declaration to the contrary.'' The vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or another body established by law, can also declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, in which case Pence would ""immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President'' until Trump could provide a written declaration to the contrary. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump used his final hours in office to wipe away convictions and prison sentences for a roster of corrupt politicians and business executives and bestow pardons on allies like Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, and Elliott Broidy, one of his top fundraisers in 2016. The wave of clemency grants underscored how many of his close associates and supporters became ensnared in corruption cases and other legal troubles. Trump, however, did not pardon himself, family members or lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The latest round of pardons and commutations â 143 in total â followed dozens last month, when Trump pardoned associates like Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. Bannon was under indictment on charges that he misused money he helped raise for a group backing Trumpâs wall but had not yet gone to trial. Broidy pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws as part of a covert campaign to influence the Trump administration on behalf of Chinese and Malaysian interests. Among others receiving pardons from Trump were three prominent Republicans who had served in the House before their convictions. They were Rick Renzi, who was sentenced in 2013 to three years in jail in association with a bribery scheme involving an Arizona land swap deal; Robert Hayes, who pleaded guilty in 2019 to lying to the FBI; and Randall Cunningham, who pleaded guilty in 2005 to taking $2.4 million in bribes from military contractors. The list also included rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black, both convicted on weapons charges. Trumpâs decision to grant Bannon pardon is the latest twist in a complicated relationship that started during the 2016 campaign, fell apart during Bannonâs time as the White Houseâs chief strategist and was resurrected in recent months as Bannon encouraged Trumpâs efforts to overturn the election. "
"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK: For three years, adherents of the sprawling QAnon conspiracy theory awaited a so-called Great Awakening, scouring anonymous web postings from a shadowy ""Q"" figure and parsing statements by former US President Donald Trump, whom they believed to be their champion. On Wednesday, they grappled with a harsh reality check: Trump had left office with no mass arrests or other victories against the supposed cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophile cannibal elites, especially Democrats, he was ostensibly fighting. Instead, Democratic President Joseph Biden was calmly sworn into office, leaving legions of QAnon faithful struggling to make sense of what had transpired. In one Telegram channel with more than 18,400 members, QAnon believers were split between those still urging others to 'trust the plan' and those saying they felt betrayed. ""It's obvious now we've been had. No plan, no Q, nothing,"" wrote one user. Some messages referenced theories that a coup was going to take place before the end of Inauguration Day. Others moved the goalposts again, speculating that Trump would be sworn into office on Mar. 4. ""Does anybody have any idea what we should be waiting for next or what the next move could be?"" asked another user, who said they wanted to have a 'big win' and arrests made. Jared Holt, a disinformation researcher at the Atlantic Council, said he had never before seen disillusionment in the QAnon communities he monitors at this scale. ""It's the whole 'trust the plan' thing. Q believers have just allowed themselves to be strung from failed promise to failed promise."" ""The whole movement is called into question now."" A poll with more than 36,000 votes conducted in another QAnon Telegram channel before Biden's swearing-in ceremony showed that more than 20% of respondents predicted nothing would in fact happen and Biden would become president, according to the Q Origins Project, which tracks the movement. However, 34% believe ""the military & Trump have a plan coming in the near future,"" even while acknowledging the transfer of presidential power. JARRING REVERSALThe anonymous person or people known as ""Q"" started posting the vague predictions that would become the basis of the QAnon movement on message board 4chan in 2017, claiming to be a Trump administration insider with top secret security clearance. The number of followers exploded with the arrival of the coronavirus last year, providing a sense of community missing in many people's isolated pandemic lives by encouraging participants to ""do their own research"" and contribute findings to the crowd. Q interpreters have become mini-celebrities in their own right, spreading the gospel on mainstream sites like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube and raising money with appeals to charity or merchandise sales, before the social media platforms cracked down late last year. Among them was Ron Watkins, who was among a small group of movement leaders who stepped up their public activity after Trump's loss in the Nov. 3 election, as the ""drops"" from Q slowed and then stopped. The longtime administrator of 8kun, an unmoderated forum where Q posted alongside violent extremists and racists, Watkins adopted the cryptic tone of Q in the past two months on Twitter and then Telegram. At the same time he positioned himself as an expert on election fraud, getting retweeted by Trump and interviewed by Trump-favored media outlets such as One America News Network. In one of the most jarring apparent reversals on Wednesday, Watkins appeared to admit defeat, posting: ""We have a new president sworn in and it is our responsibility as citizens to respect the Constitution regardless of whether or not we agree with the specifics."" ""Please remember all the friends and happy memories we made together over the past few years."" He said he was working on a new venture, but gave no further details. On TheDonald.win, a reconstituted version of the Reddit forum ""The Donald"" that long served as an online home for Trump loyalists, users turned on Watkins and accused him of being a ""shill"" and a CIA plant. Other fringe groups, including neo-Nazis, said they intended to capitalize on the disarray by stepping up recruitment from among QAnon followers. "
"SEOUL: South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who brokered the talks process between Donald Trump and the North's leader Kim Jong Un, on Thursday congratulated Joe Biden on his inauguration as US president, tweeting: ""America is back."" The relationship between treaty allies Seoul and Washington was at times deeply strained under Trump, who repeatedly excoriated the South for not paying enough towards the US troop presence in the country, demanding billions of dollars more. In his first year in power, Trump raised widespread alarm in the South by engaging in personal insults and threats of war with Kim -- at one point accusing the pro-engagement Moon of ""appeasement"". Biden has repeatedly spoken of the need to rebuild the United States' global standing and declared in his inauguration speech: ""We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again."" The centre-left Moon welcomed Biden's swearing-in on his verified Twitter account, writing: ""America is back. America's new beginning will make democracy even greater. ""Together with the Korean people, I stand by your journey toward 'America United'"", he added. ""We go together!"" The US led the UN coalition forces that backed the South and fought North Korean and Chinese troops to a standstill in the 1950-53 Korean War, and Washington still stations around 28,500 of its forces in the South to defend it against its neighbour. Moon seized on his hosting of the 2018 Winter Olympics to broker a dialogue between Trump and Kim that saw them hold an unprecedented summit in a blaze of publicity in Singapore. At the time, they signed a vaguely worded statement on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but a second summit in Hanoi in early 2019 collapsed over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return. The process has been stalled ever since, despite a third encounter in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula. "
"WASHINGTON: In a blow to his predecessor Donald Trump's actions to limit immigration, US President Joe Biden on Wednesday has ended the 'Muslim travel ban', which blocked travel to the United States from several predominantly Muslim and African countries. Hours after taking the office, Biden on Wednesday signed 17 executive orders memorandums and proclamations including ending the Muslim travel ban. He has directed the State Department to restart visa processing for individuals from the affected countries and to develop ways to address the harm caused to those who were prevented from coming to the United States because of the ban, The New York Times reported. Implemented in 2017 during Trump's first week in office, the Muslim Ban initially restricted travel from seven Muslim-majority nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban faced several legal challenges, but the Supreme Court in 2018 upheld the final version of the measure. The Muslim travel ban so far restricts citizens from 12 countries -- Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan, Tanzania and North Korea -- and some Venezuelan officials and their relatives from obtaining a broad range of US visas, NPR reported. With another executive order, Biden has bolstered the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects from deportation immigrants brought to the United States as children, often called Dreamers. Another executive order revoked the Trump administration's plan to exclude non-citizens from the census count, and another overturns a Trump executive order that pushed aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorised immigrants. Biden has also halted construction of Trump's border wall with Mexico. The order includes an ""immediate termination"" of the national emergency declaration that allowed the Trump administration to redirect billions of dollars to the wall. (ANI) "
"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden returned the United States to the worldwide fight to slow global warming in one of his first official acts and immediately launched a series of climate-friendly efforts that would transform how Americans drive and get their power. âA cry for survival comes from the planet itself,â Biden said in his inaugural address on Wednesday. âA cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now.â Biden signed an executive order rejoining the Paris climate accord within hours of taking the oath of office, fulfilling a campaign pledge. The move undoes the US withdrawal ordered by predecessor Donald Trump, who belittled the science behind climate efforts, loosened regulations on heat-trapping oil, gas and coal emissions, and spurred oil and gas leasing in pristine Arctic tundra and other wilderness. The Paris accord commits 195 countries and other signatories to come up with a goal to reduce carbon pollution and monitor and report their fossil fuel emissions. The United States is the world's number 2 carbon emitter after China. Biden's move will solidify political will globally, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday. âNot a single country in this world, however powerful, however resourceful one may be, can do it alone,â said Ban, speaking virtually at a briefing in the Netherlands for an upcoming Climate Adaptation Summit. âWe have to put all our hands on the deck. That is the lesson, very difficult lesson, which we have learned during last year,"" as Trump made good on his pledge to pull out of the global accord. The current UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, welcomed Biden's steps, saying the US reentry to the climate agreement means countries producing two-thirds of carbon pollution have committed to carbon neutrality. Biden signed other directives to start undoing other Trump climate rollbacks. He ordered a temporary moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in what had been virgin Arctic wilderness, directed federal agencies to start looking at tougher mileage standards and other emission limits again, and began revoking Trump's approval for the Keystone XL oil and gas pipeline. Another first-day order directed agencies to consider the impact on climate, disadvantaged communities, and on future generations from any regulatory action that affects fossil fuel emissions, a new requirement. Human-caused climate change has been linked to worsening natural disasters, including wildfires, droughts, flooding and hurricanes. However, there was no immediate word on when Biden would make good on another climate campaign pledge, one banning new oil and gas leasing on federal land. After Biden notifies the UN by letter of his intention to rejoin the Paris accord, it would become effective in 30 days, UN spokesman Alex Saier said. Rejoining the Paris accords could put the U.S. on track to cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 40 per cent to 50 per cent by 2030, experts said. âThere's a lot we can do because we've left so much on the table over the last four years,"" said Kate Larsen, former deputy director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality during the Obama administration. Biden has promised that the needed transformations of the US transportation and power sectors, and other changes, will mean millions of jobs. Opponents of the climate accord, including Republican lawmakers who supported Trump's withdrawal from it, have said it would mean higher gas prices and higher electricity prices â even though wind and solar have become more affordable than coal, and competitive with natural gas, in generating electricity. âThe Paris climate agreement is based on the backward idea that the United States is a culprit here, when in reality the United States is the leading driver of climate solutions,â said Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican. Republican senators are expected to introduce legislation that would require Biden to submit the Paris plan to the Senate for ratification. It's not clear whether the narrowly divided Senate would have the two-thirds votes needed to ratify the agreement, which was never approved by Congress. Supporters say congressional approval is not needed. Most of the pollution-reduction goals set by the agreement are voluntary. The climate deal is based on each nation setting a goal for cutting carbon pollution by 2030. Other countries submitted theirs by last month. The US did not. Saier said America just needs to submit its goal some time before November climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland. A longtime international goal, included in the Paris accord with an even more stringent target, is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 1.2 degrees since that time. As of 2020, US emissions were 24 per cent below 2005 levels, but that reflected the extraordinary economic slowdown stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, energy and climate director for the Breakthrough Institute. There are two big areas where climate policy deals with day-to-day American life. One is electricity generation, and the other is transportation. Market forces have made wind and solar cheaper than dirtier coal, fueling a quiet transformation toward cleaner fuels, and that's expected to continue so that eventually nearly all of the nation's power will be low or zero carbon, Larsen and other experts say. What happens to cars, trucks and buses will be far more noticeable. Several experts foresee the majority of new cars purchased in 2030 being electric. "
"Donald Trump is weighing forming a new political outfit called the Patriot Party in a bid to rally his Maga base and exert continued influence after he leaves the White House. Trump has talked in recent days with associates about his venture, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, confirming the projection in several quarters in recent weeks that the Republican Party is heading for a split. Trump has repeatedly lashed out in recent days at the establishment wing of the Grand Old Party, including at his vice-president Mike Pence, and Senator Mitch McConnell, for not helping him steal an  he lost. They in turn have thrown Trump under the bus even though he appears to command majority legislative support. McConnell on Tuesday directly accused Trump of provoking the mob that stormed the Capitol by feeding them lies. Pence gave Trump farewell a miss but attended the Biden inauguration. Trump still commands enormous support among the Republican base. A Morning Consult-Politico survey published last week found 42% of Republicans say they would support Trump if he ran in 2024, a decrease of 13 percentage points from November but still significant. Many Republican lawmakers, particularly Senators who are up for reelection in 2022, are fearful of being âprimariedâ by the Trump base (defeated in the inner-party elections) as Trump has threatened. But that is also the reason some Republican lawmakers are looking at the prospect of putting Trump out of the 2024 race and holding elective office by joining Democrats and impeaching him. The US has long embraced a two-party system. The most recent third party candidate to win over 5% of the votes was Ross Perot, a tech entrepreneur who ran as an independent and as standard-bearer of the Reform Party in 1992 and 1996, winning 18.9% and 8.4% of the vote respectively. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Thursday for the first time that he would leave the White House if Joe Biden is officially confirmed the winner of the US election, even as he railed against the ""rigged"" vote. Trump has made an unprecedented attempt to defy the results of the election by refusing to concede, spreading wild theories about stolen ballots and launching baseless legal challenges that have been thrown out by courts. Answering his first questions from reporters since the November 3 vote, the president moved closer to accepting that he would serve only one term in office before Biden is inaugurated on January 20. When asked if he would leave the White House if the Electoral College confirmed Biden's victory, Trump said, ""Certainly I will. And you know that."" But ""if they do, they made a mistake,"" he said, adding, ""It's going to be a very hard thing to concede."" ""I think that there will be a lot of things happening between now and (January) 20th,"" he said. The Electoral College, which determines the White House winner, will meet on December 14 to certify Biden's victory, with Biden receiving 306 votes to Trump's 232. ""This election was a fraud,"" Trump said, again without providing any evidence during his remarks to reporters at the White House after he spoke to military personnel via video-link on the Thanksgiving holiday. He described the US voting infrastructure as ""like a third-world country."" Earlier in the day he tweeted that ""this was a 100% RIGGED ELECTION,"" while on Wednesday he called on his Republican supporters ""to turn the election over."" President-elect Biden has said that Americans ""won't stand"" for attempts to derail the vote outcome, and urged for Americans to unite to fight the worsening pandemic. More than 260,000 people have died in the US from Covid-19, with daily death tolls surging to 2,000 on recent days. Trump's refusal to concede the election to Biden has added to the countless norms he has torn up during his four years in power. Supporters suggest he is already eyeing a run for president in 2024. Trump, 74, is alleging -- among other conspiracy theories -- that voting machines deliberately deleted millions of his votes, though the government election security agency declared it ""the most secure"" election in US history. Under pressure from some senior Republicans, Trump this week ended his blockade of government assistance to ease Biden's preparation for assuming the presidency. Trump said Thursday he would soon travel to Georgia to campaign ahead of two key runoff elections that will decide which party controls the Senate. Biden, 78, this week introduced a slate of veteran diplomats and policy-makers who will make up his national security and foreign policy team, saying: ""America is back, ready to lead the world."" He said that in his first 100 days in office, he would tackle the Covid crisis, scrap Trump policies ""damaging"" the environment and push legislation offering millions of undocumented US residents a route to citizenship.

"JOINT BASE ANDREWS, UNITED STATES: US President Donald Trump left Washington on Wednesday just three hours ahead of the inauguration of his successor Joe Biden, saying it had been an ""incredible four years"" and promising to be ""back in some form."" ""I just want to say goodbye but hopefully it's not a long-term goodbye,"" Trump said in remarks to reporters at the White House before he and First Lady Melania Trump walked a short red carpet and boarded Marine One for the helicopter ride to Joint Base Andrews. Joe Biden's inauguration ceremony: All you need to knowSpeaking to a small crowd of supporters, staff and family members at Andrews after a 21-gun salute and a serenade of ""Hail to the Chief,"" Trump said ""this has been an incredible four years.""

""We will be back in some form."" The 74-year-old Trump has hinted at running for president again in 2024, but faces a trial in the Senate over his role in the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters and a potential ban on holding office in the future.

Trump did not address Biden by name in his remarks but said he wishes the new administration ""great luck and great success."" A White House spokesman said Trump, in keeping with tradition, had left a letter for Biden in the Oval Office. Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that he won the November 3 election and he was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives after his supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to disrupt the certification by Congress of Biden's victory. "
"WASHINGTON: Joe Biden, known as a peoples' person, a reformer, an unifier and a healer, rose remarkably from humble beginnings to become the oldest American president in US history on Wednesday, reaching the pinnacle of his political career spanning nearly five decades. The 78-year-old six-term Democratic senator, who triumphed over Republican President Donald Trump in the November 3 presidential election, ran twice unsuccessfully for President - in 1988 and 2008. The presidential dreams that the veteran leader from Delaware had harboured since childhood seemed all but over for a third time until he won South Carolina's Democratic Party primary on February 29 last year, forcing most rivals out of the race and making one of the most dramatic comebacks in American political history. Biden, who has spent five decades in Washington and served two terms in the White House as former president Barack Obama's vice president, capitalised on that experience to portray himself as a tested leader and a better alternative to Trump. While accepting the Democratic nomination in August, Biden pledged to restore the ""soul of America"", and be an ""ally of the light, not the darkness."" Biden defeated 74-year-old Trump in the bitterly fought presidential election, becoming the oldest person ever to occupy the White House. In his victory speech, Biden pledged to unite the country as he called it 'a time to heal in America'. ""I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class and to make America respected around the world again, and to unite us here at home,"" he said. Biden has a strong track record of being an ardent advocate of a strong India-US relationship both as a Senator from Delaware for over three decades and then as deputy of President Obama for eight years. During his presidential campaign, Biden had said that India and the US were natural partners. From playing a key role in the passage of India-US civil nuclear deal during a Republican administration to setting up the goal of a $500 billion in bilateral trade, Biden has strong ties with the Indian leadership across the aisle and has a large number of Indian-Americans within his close circuit. Biden has named at least 20 Indian Americans, including 13 women, to key positions in his administration, a new record in itself for this small ethnic community that constitutes one per cent of the country's population. As many as 17 of them would be part of the powerful White House complex. Biden's inauguration as the 46th US president is already historic as for the first time ever a woman, Kamala Harris, would be sworn as the vice president of the country. Harris, 56, is also the first ever Indian-origin and first African American to become the vice president of the United States. Born in Pennsylvania in 1942 to a Catholic family, Joe Robinette Biden Jr studied at the University of Delaware and then earned a law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. His father worked cleaning furnaces and as a used car salesman. Biden, the man of ""humble beginnings"" as the campaign website puts in, was first elected in 1972, and served six terms as a senator for the state of Delaware. Aged 29, he was one of the youngest people ever elected to the US Senate, and his age at his first election contributed to him being consistently ranked as one of the least wealthy members in the Senate. Biden unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008 before finally securing his party's backing this year with strong support among Black voters. Known for blunt talk, Biden speaks openly about his family's tragedies including the 1972 car crash that killed his first wife Neilia and their 13-month-old daughter Naomi, while his sons Beau and Hunter were critically injured in the accident. Biden met his second wife Jill Jacobs in 1975, and they married in June 1977. They had a daughter, Ashley, in 1981. In 2015, Beau, an Iraq war veteran who had served as Delaware's attorney general, died of a brain tumour aged 46. Biden's son Hunter struggled with drug issues as an adult. Biden himself had a health scare in 1988 when he suffered two brain aneurysms. He has referred to his personal losses on the campaign trail, and declared: ""Healthcare is personal to me."" In October, Biden pointed to his son's terminal diagnosis and said: ""I can't fathom what would have happened if the insurance companies had the power to say âlast few months, you're on your own."" He secured the Democratic nomination when his last competitor Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out in April 2020. Biden faced allegations from former staffer Tara Reade in 2019, who said she felt uncomfortable with Biden during her time in his Senate office in the 90s. In March 2020, she also accused him of sexual assault in 1993. Biden and his campaign team strongly denied the allegation. Biden has voiced support for LGBT rights, calling himself ""absolutely comfortable"" with the idea of same-sex marriage. He also led the Gun Violence Task Force in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012. His loyalty to the first African American President was rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, presented by Obama days before he left office in 2017. Obama officially endorsed Biden in April, saying ""he will be a great president and he treats everyone with dignity and with respect"". "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump left the White House for the final time on Wednesday, heading by helicopter to a nearby military base where he will fly to Florida, skipping the inauguration of successor Joe Biden in an extraordinary break with tradition. Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania Trump walked a short red carpet and boarded Marine One on the White House lawn on a sunny but chilly day in Washington for the short flight to Joint Base Andrews where he will board Air Force One. Trump will be at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when Biden is sworn in at noon (1700 GMT) as the 46th president of the United States. "
"WASHINGTON: Hours after being sworn in as the 46th US President, Joe Biden would sign 15 executive orders - including rejoining the Paris climate agreement, a 100-day mask mandate and reversing the Muslim ban - undoing some of the major policies of his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden's first presidential actions would also include sending a comprehensive bill on immigration to the Congress, incoming White House officials said. The immigration bill proposes a eight-year pathway to illegal immigrants and removing the per country cap for employment-based green cards, a move that would benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals in the US, whose current wait period for legal permanent residency runs into several decades. ""President-elect Biden is taking historic action on day one to advance his agenda â including signing 15 executive actions and asking agencies to take steps in an additional two areas. This compares to two day one executive actions from Biden's four predecessors in the White House combined,"" incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Biden will continue to take action over the next 10 days â and over his entire time in office â to address the four crises that he's laid out, she said. Biden will sign executive orders, memoranda, directives and letters to take initial steps to address Covid-19 pandemic, providing economic relief, tackling climate change and advancing racial equity, officials said. Biden will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving the country forward. These actions are bold and begin the work of following through his promises to Americans, according to a fact sheet issued by the Biden Transition. One of his first acts would be to launch his ""100 Days Masking Challenge,"" asking Americans to mask up for 100 days. He will issue an executive order requiring masks and physical distancing in all federal buildings, on all federal lands, and by federal employees and contractors. Biden will also take action to cease the Trump administration's process of withdrawing from the World Health Organisation. The Biden-Harris administration with Dr Antony Fauci as the head of the delegation will participate at the ongoing WHO executive board meeting. Fauci is America's top infectious disease expert. Once the US resumes its engagement with WHO, it will work with the world health body and its partners to strengthen and reform the organisation, support the Covid-19 health and humanitarian response and advance global health and health security. Biden will sign an executive order creating the position of Covid-19 response coordinator, who will report directly to the President and be responsible for coordinating all elements of the Covid-19 response across government. Biden will sign the instrument to rejoin the Paris accord, according to incoming White House officials. The instrument will be deposited with the UN on Wednesday, and the US will officially become a party again 30 days later. In addition, he will sign an executive order that takes critical first steps to address the climate crisis, create good union jobs and advance environmental justice, while reversing Trump administration's harmful policies, the officials said. Through another executive order, Biden will begin the work of embedding equity across federal policymaking and rooting out systemic racism and other barriers to opportunity from federal programs and institutions. The order will define equity as the consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial treatment of all individuals, including from underserved communities like Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, LGBTQ+, people with disabilities and religious minorities. Biden will sign an order to revoke Trump administration's orders of setting out an unlawful plan to exclude non-citizens from the census and apportionment of Congressional representatives. He will sign an executive action, putting an end to the Muslim Ban, a policy rooted in religious animus and xenophobia, officials said. It repeals Trump's proclamations, which restrict entry into the US from primarily Muslim and African countries, and instructs the state department to restart visa processing for affected countries and to swiftly develop a proposal to restore fairness and remedy the harms caused by the bans. By a proclamation, Biden will declare an immediate termination of the national emergency declaration that was used as a pretext to justify some of the funding diversions for the Mexico border wall. In another executive order, Biden will order every appointee in the executive branch to sign an ethics pledge to ensure that executive branch employees act in the interest of the American people and not for personal gain. Biden will issue a presidential memorandum withdrawing Trump administration's regulatory process executive orders to remove those needless obstacles to regulating in the public's interest. He will direct office of management and budget director Neera Tanden to develop recommendations for improving and modernising regulatory review. Biden will sign a presidential memorandum directing homeland security to take appropriate actions to provide temporary relief from deportation on a case-by-case basis to Dreamers. It will call on Congress to enact law providing permanent status and a path to citizenship for people who came to the US as children and have contributed to the nation for many years. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has released current and former members of his administration from the terms of their ethics pledge, which included a five-year ban on lobbying their former agencies. The ethics pledge was outlined in one of Trump's first executive orders, signed on Jan. 28, 2017, as part of his campaign pledge to ""drain the swamp.'' It required Trump's political appointees to agree to the lobbying ban, as well as pledge not to undertake work that would require them to register as a ""foreign agent'' after leaving government. Trump signed the one-page revocation of the order on Tuesday, and it was released by the White House shortly after 1 am Wednesday, hours before his term ends. "
"TEHRAN: Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday hailed the White House departure of ""tyrant"" Donald Trump, saying that ""the ball is in America's court"" to return to a landmark nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Tehran. Trump is due to leave office later in the day making way for President-elect Joe Biden, whose team has signalled a willingness to return to dialogue with Tehran. A ""tyrant's era came to an end and today is the final day of his ominous reign,"" Rouhani said in televised remarks to his cabinet. He labelled Trump ""someone for whom all of his four years bore no fruit other than injustice and corruption and causing problems for his own people and the world"". During his presidency, Trump led a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" against Iran, pulling Washington out of a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018 and reimposing punishing sanctions. The sanctions targeted Iran's vital oil sales and international banking ties, plunging its economy into a deep recession. The nuclear deal, agreed between major powers and Iran in 2015 when Biden was vice president under Barack Obama, imposed clear limits on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Since 2019, Tehran has suspended its compliance with most of the limits set by the agreement in response to Washington's abandonment of sanctions relief and the failure of the other parties to make up for it. Rouhani said Trump's political career had ""died ... but the JCPOA is alive,"" referring to the agreement's official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ""He did all he could to destroy the JCPOA but could not. ""We expect (the Biden administration) to return to law and to commitments, and try in the next four years, if they can, to remove the stains of the past four years,"" he added. Biden's pick for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, said at a Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday that Trump's policies had made Iran ""more dangerous"". Blinken confirmed Biden's desire for Washington to return to the nuclear agreement, but said that was conditional on Tehran's return to strict compliance with its commitments. Tehran has repeatedly called on Washington to lift sanctions first and respect its own obligations under the agreement. It has said it will then return to full compliance. ""Mr Biden should know that his responsibility is to lift these sanctions,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters after the cabinet meeting. Rouhani too said ""the ball is in America's court"" and emphasised that when Washington starts to carry out its commitments ""we too will act on our commitments"". ""If they return to the law, our response will be positive as well."" "
"JERUSALEM: An Israeli watchdog group said Tuesday that the government approved nearly 2,600 new housing units in east Jerusalem and the West Bank settlements a day before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Israeli authorities made a major last-minute push this week to advance settlement construction in the occupied West Bank, which the Palestinians seek as part of a future independent state, in the twilight hours of the Trump administration. The anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now said the majority of the new government tenders â published on Tuesday, President Donald Trump's last full day in office â are deep inside the West Bank. Earlier this week, the Israeli government advanced plans for nearly 800 homes in West Bank settlements. Israel accelerated settlement construction under Trump, whose administration did not criticize settlement announcements and in 2018 said it did not consider settlements illegal under international law. According to Peace Now, Israel approved or advanced construction of over 12,000 settlement homes in 2020, the highest number in a single year since it started recording in 2012. Biden is expected to reverse course and adopt the traditional American stance of opposing settlement constructions, setting the stage for tension with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. âOur out-of-touch government leadership continues to press on with its mad scramble to promote as much settlement activity as possible until the last minutes before the change of the administration in Washington,â said Peace Now. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. In the decades since, it has built dozens of settlements in the West Bank that most countries consider illegal under international law. The Palestinians claim all of the West Bank as part of a future independent state. They say Israel's growing settler population, approaching some 500,000 people, is an impediment to peace. "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump will walk out of the White House and board Marine One for the last time as president on Wednesday, leaving behind a legacy of chaos and tumult and a nation bitterly divided. Four years after standing on stage at his own inauguration and painting a dire picture of âAmerican carnage,"" Trump departs the office twice impeached, with millions more out of work and 400,000 dead from the coronavirus. Republicans under his watch lost the presidency and both chambers of Congress. He will be forever remembered for the final major act of his presidency: inciting an insurrection at the Capitol that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer, and horrified the nation. Trump will be the first president in modern history to boycott his successor's inauguration as he continues to stew about his loss and privately maintains the election that President-elect Joe Biden fairly won was stolen from him. Republican officials in several critical states, members of his own administration and a wide swath of judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected those arguments. Still, Trump has refused to participate in any of the symbolic passing-of-the-torch traditions surrounding the peaceful transition of power, including inviting the Bidens over for a get-to-know-you visit. By the time Biden is sworn in, Trump will already have landed at his private Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida, to face an uncertain future â but not before giving himself a grand military sendoff, complete with a red carpet, military band and 21-gun salute. Guests have been invited, but it is unclear how many will attend. Even Vice President Mike Pence plans to skip the event, citing the logistical challenges of getting from the air base to the inauguration ceremonies. Washington has been transformed into a security fortress, with thousands of National Guard troops, fencing and checkpoints to try to stave off further violence. Aides had urged Trump to spend his final days in office trying to salvage his legacy by highlighting his administration's achievements â passing tax cuts, scaling back federal regulations, normalizing relations in the Middle East. But Trump largely refused, taking a single trip to the Texas border and releasing a video in which he pledged to his supporters that âthe movement we started is only just beginning.â Trump will retire to Florida with a small group of former White House aides as he charts a political future that looks very different now than just two weeks ago. Before the Capitol riot, Trump had been expected to remain his party's de facto leader, wielding enormous power as he served as a kingmaker and mulled a 2024 presidential run. But now he appears more powerless than ever â shunned by so many in his party, impeached twice, denied the Twitter bullhorn he had intended to use as his weapon and even facing the prospect that, if he is convicted in his Senate trial, he could be barred from seeking a second term. For now, Trump remains angry and embarrassed, consumed with rage and grievance. He spent the week after the election sinking deeper and deeper into a world of conspiracy, and those who have spoken with him say he continues to believe he won in November. He continues to lash out at Republicans for perceived disloyalty and has threatened, both publicly and privately, to spend the coming years backing primary challenges against those he feel betrayed him. Some expect him to eventually turn completely on the Republican Party, perhaps by flirting with a run as a third-party candidate as an act of revenge. For all the chaos and drama and bending the world to his will, Trump ended his term as he began it: largely alone. The Republican Party he co-opted finally appeared to have had enough after Trump's supporters violently stormed the Capitol, hunting for lawmakers who refused to go along with Trump's unconstitutional efforts to overturn the results of a democratic election. But although Washington may have had enough, Trump retains his grip on the Republican base, with the support of millions of loyal voters, along with allies still helming the Republican National Committee and many state party organisations. The city he leaves will not miss him. Trump rarely left the confines of the White House, except to visit his own hotel. He and his wife never once ate dinner at any other local restaurant; never ventured out to shop in its stores or see the sites. When he did leave, it was almost always to one of his properties: his golf course in Virginia, his golf course in New Jersey, his private club and nearby golf course in Palm Beach, Florida. The city overwhelmingly supported Biden, with 93% of the vote. Trump received just 5.4% of the vote â or fewer than 18,600 ballots â not enough to fill the Washington Capitals hockey arena. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had given a full pardon to a former Google engineer sentenced for stealing a trade secret on self-driving cars months before he briefly headed Uber Technologies Inc's rival unit. Anthony Levandowski, 40, was sentenced in August to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty in March. He was not in custody but a judge had said he could enter custody once the Covid-19 pandemic subsided. The White House said Levandowski had ""paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good."" Alphabet Inc's Waymo, a self-driving auto technology unit spun out of Google, declined to comment. The company previously described Levandowski's crime as ""a betrayal"" and his sentence ""a win for trade secret laws."" The pardon was backed by several leaders in the technology industry who have supported Trump, including investors Peter Thiel and Blake Masters and entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, according to the White House. Levandowski transferred more than 14,000 Google files, including development schedules and product designs, to his personal laptop before he left, and while negotiating a new role with Uber. "
"NEW YORK: When he assumes office on Wednesday, US President-elect Joe Biden will inherit a stock market near all-time highs, along with a gaping budget deficit, a weakening dollar, elevated economic uncertainty and a Federal Reserve that may have less ammunition to fight the next crisis. Here's a look at what has changed in markets over the last four years and what investors have to look forward to over Bidenâs term: 1. Markets under TrumpThe S&P 500 is up about 68% since President Donald Trump took office. Its 73% surge since late March has been aided by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as expectations that a Covid-19 vaccine will spur economic reopening. Ultra-low Treasury yields - which plunged after the Fed cut interest rates to near-zero - have also increased the allure of stocks. 2. 100 daysIf history is any guide, the stock market should give Biden a warm welcome. The S&P 500 has risen in the first 100 calendar days in eight of the last 10 presidential terms. Still, Bidenâs first 100 days may be more fraught than those of his predecessors: while he needs to stimulate the economy quickly, the slender Democratic majority in Congress means the final size and timing of a proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package remain uncertain. 3. Does the buck stop here?Biden is also inheriting a dollar thatâs fallen 12% from last year's highs. A weaker dollar aids exporters by boosting the competitiveness of US products abroad and increases the appeal of US stocks by making them more affordable to foreign buyers. Rallying US yields have recently lifted the dollar off its lows, and a more sustained move in the greenback risks sparking an unwind of the marketâs near-record bearish dollar position and sparking more gains in the currency. Regardless of where the dollar goes, the incoming administration has signaled it will be less likely to comment on the currencyâs fluctuations than Trump, who periodically railed against a strong dollar. 4. More debtThe national debt ballooned by almost 40% under Trump to nearly $28 trillion, fueled by the passage of tax cuts in 2017 and a flood of spending to counter the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic last year. Some investors worry the country's exceedingly cloudy fiscal picture risks tarnishing the appeal of US government debt over the long term, an outcome that may eventually weigh on the US dollar's attractiveness as a reserve currency. In July, Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on the United Statesâ triple-A rating to negative from stable, citing eroding credit strength. The US national debt is likely to continue growing under Biden. Janet Yellen, his nominee for Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers on Tuesday to ""act big"" on the next coronavirus relief package, adding that the benefits outweigh the costs of a higher debt burden. 5. Bloated balance sheetBiden will inherit a Federal Reserve balance sheet that is bigger than ever, thanks to ramped-up spending in the wake of the pandemic. Some worry that interest rates already at rock-bottom levels and asset purchases currently at $120 billion a month may give the central bank less scope to maneuver if the economy worsens or a fresh crisis hits, putting an additional focus on fiscal policy. The Fedâs balance sheet is expected to grow to $9.1 trillion by the end of 2021, a December Reuters poll showed. 6. Uncertain timesThe coronavirus pandemic ratcheted up economic concerns during the last year of Trump's term. Earlier years of his presidency were marked by flaring trade frictions between the United States and China that rocked asset prices. Policy-related economic uncertainty as measured by https://www.policyuncertainty.com/ , based on mentions of economic uncertainty in news articles, is currently higher than it was following 9/11 or the Great Financial Crisis.

"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump granted clemency to former White House aide Steve Bannon as part of a wave of pardons and commutations issued in his final hours in office, a senior administration official said, but did not pardon himself, members of his family or lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Trump leaves office on Wednesday, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the nation's next president. White House officials had argued to Trump that he should not pardon himself or his family because it might look like they are guilty of crimes, according to a source familiar with the situation. Trump also pardoned Elliott Broidy, a former top fundraiser for Trump who pleaded guilty last year to violating foreign lobbying laws, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges, a senior administration official said. Rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black who were prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, were also granted pardons. Bannon, who was a key adviser in Trump's 2016 presidential run, was charged last year with swindling Trump supporters over an effort to raise private funds to build the president's wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. He has pleaded not guilty. White House officials had advised Trump against pardoning Bannon. The two men have lately rekindled their relationship as Trump sought support for his unproven claims of voter fraud, an official familiar with the situation said. Giuliani, who has been at the forefront of unsuccessful efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, has not been charged with a crime, but investigators have been probing his activities in Ukraine. PROMINENT ALLIESBannon, 67, is the latest prominent political ally to receive clemency from Trump, who has often used the powers of the executive branch to reward loyalists and punish his enemies. Trump previously pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI about his conversation with the former Russian ambassador, and he commuted the prison term for Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Bannon can still be charged in state court in New York, where a pardon would not help him, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former prosecutor now at the Buckley law firm. Fraud prosecutions are frequently brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Alonso said. Broidy, who was a top fundraiser for Trump during the 2016 campaign, pleaded guilty in October to violating lobbying laws by attempting to influence the administration on behalf of Chinese and Malaysian interests. Lil Wayne, 38, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., pleaded guilty in federal court in December to illegally possessing a firearm and faced up to 10 years in prison. He has expressed support for Trump's criminal justice reform efforts. Kodak Black, 23, who was born Bill Kahan Kapri, is in federal prison for making a false statement in order to buy a firearm. "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump who leaves his presidency has never in his four-year term in office attempted to be part of the local community. A case in point is that unlike his predecessors, Trump has visited only one restaurant - the one in his own Pennsylvania Avenue hotel. While former President Barack Obama was known for hitting all the trendy hotspots for date nights, Trump, who is known for his love of fast food, has never stepped into a DC fast-food joint. He, however, had once sent a former bodyguard to make McDonald's runs and even catered White House events with Burger King and Domino's. According to a report in Washingtonian, Trump is a creature of habit as when he does venture out for a meal at the Trump hotel's steakhouse, BLT Prime, he pretty much always orders the same thing: shrimp cocktail, fries and well-done steak. He did this because here he knows he will get exactly the food he wants in the way that he wants, along with fans cheering him on. In 2016, he had told attorneys that ""there aren't that many"" great restaurants in Washington as part of a deposition in a lawsuit with celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian. In 2017 he said in an interview on the Larry O'Connor Show, ""In Washington, you do have some great restaurants, and I'm going to start going to them,"" Washingtonian said. He said that he would start visiting other restaurants too. ""I was accused the other day. Well, when I leave the White House, which is seldom, I always go to my hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, and they say, 'He should go to other places.' And I never thought of it. And I'm going to start doing that. I'm going to go around."" In 2019, Trump said that he along with First Lady Melania Trump would stop by at the Michelin-starred Inn at Little Washington while awarding the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal to Chief Patrick O'Connell. However, he is yet to step into the restaurant. The magazine Washingtonian opined that ""there aren't a lot of places around DC where he would have been welcomed"". ""If he wasn't outright asked to leave--like former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was at Virginia's Red Hen--he'd likely have been met with booing and cursing from other diners. And any restaurant that hosted him--no matter its bipartisan stance--would have no doubt faced backlash by mere association,"" the magazine opined. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's youngest daughter, Tiffany, is engaged to be married. The 27-year-old recent Georgetown law school graduate announced her good news on Instagram on Tuesday, her father's final full day in office. She shared a photograph of herself and fiance Michael Boulos posing on the West Wing colonnade at the White House. ``It has been an honor to celebrate many milestones, historic occasions and create memories with my family here at the White House, none more special than my engagement to my amazing fiance Michael!''

Looking forward to our next chapter together,'' he wrote. Tiffany Trump is the president's daughter with Marla Maples, his second ex-wife. She and Boutros have been dating for the past few years and have attended White House events together. "
"WASHINGTON: On his last night in the White House, outgoing President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday suspending the deportation of Venezuelans from US territory for a period of 18 months, citing the ongoing crisis in their own country. ""I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer the removal of any national of Venezuela, or alien without nationality who last habitually resided in Venezuela,"" for 18 months, the executive ordered signed by Trump said. The move had been pushed by the president's Republican allies in Florida, where many Venezuelans have settled after fleeing the economic collapse and political turmoil in their native country, ruled for more than two decades by a socialist regime. The Miami Herald said the order could aid up to 200,000 Venezuelans who live under threat of detention and deportation. "
"With the US approaching a once-unthinkable coronavirus death toll of 4,00,000 people, Joe Biden on the eve of his inauguration as president is assuming the role of mourner-in chief and projecting an air of command of the issue that has vexed the Trump administration for the past year. On Monday night, as President Trump ordered an end to the ban on travellers from Europe and Brazil aimed at stopping Covid spread, Bidenâs aides said he would rescind the move when he takes office on Wednesday, before it was scheduled to go into effect. Trump, in a proclamation, said that the travel curbs, which apply to non-citizens trying to come to the US, would no longer be needed on January 26, once the CDC start requiring proof of a negative virus test before boarding for all passengers from abroad. The proclamation appeared to be an effort to help the airline and hospitality industries. Meanwhile, California on Monday became the first state to record over 3 million cases. It took 292 days to get to 1 million cases on November 11 and 44 days to top 2 million. "
"WASHINGTON: Praying for the success of Joe Biden in keeping America safe and prosperous and extending his best wishes, outgoing US President Donald Trump in his farewell video message said that now more than ever, Americans must unify around their shared values and rise above partisan rancour to forge their common destiny. Trump, in a pre-recorded video message released by the White House on Tuesday, said to serve as the President has been an honour beyond description. âThank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that's what it is -- a great privilege and a great honour,â he said. âThis week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck -- a very important word,â Trump said on the eve of his departure from the White House for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Wednesday afternoon, he would be succeeded by Joe Bide as the 46th President of the United States. Trump has announced that he will not attend the inauguration of his successor. Indian-origin Kamala Harris would be sworn in as the Vice President of the US. Outgoing Vice President Mike Pence would be present during the inaugural ceremony at the Capitol Hill, facing the majestic National Mall. In his video that lasted a little less than 20 minutes, Trump addressed the storming of the US Capitol by his supporters on January 6, which is considered as one of the darkest days in the history of American democracy and sought unity from his fellow Americans. âAll Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now, more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancour, and forge our common destiny,â Trump said. Listing out some of the key accomplishments of the US government from January 20, 2017 to January 20, 2021, Trump said his administration achieved more than anyone thought possible. âNobody thought we could even come close,â he said as he referred to the largest package of tax cuts, slapping tariffs on China, achieving energy independence and development of a Covid-19 vaccine in a record short span of time. âWe restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don't lose that respect,â Trump said, adding that his administration revitalized US alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. He further said as a result of ""our bold diplomacy and principled realism"", the US achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. ""Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home,â he said. He also asserted that he was ""especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new warsâ. Trump, 74, said as he leaves the White House after four years, he has been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance all Americans share. âAs the world's most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people,â he said. Trump said the key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling the shared national identity. That means focusing on what Americans have in common -- the heritage they all share. âAt the centre of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It's not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions,â he said. Trump, in the aftermath of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, has been banned by the majority of the social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. He has described this as an assault on free speech. âIn America, we don't insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don't do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That's not who we are. It will never be who we are,â he said on Tuesday on the eve of his departure. Trump in his farewell speech indicated that he might be out of the White House, but he will continue to have an active public life. âNow, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There's never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day,â Trump said. âI go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come,â he said.

"Federal authorities have arrested a Pennsylvania woman accused of stealing a laptop computer or hard drive from US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office during the storming of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, US media reported. Riley June Williams, who has been charged with unlawfully breaching the Capitol building and with disorderly conduct was arrested on Monday, the Associated Press said. The FBI said in a court filing on Sunday that Williams was seen on video taking ""a laptop computer or hard drive"" from Pelosi's office. It is investigating whether she tried to sell the device to Russian intelligence. The New York Times reported that Williams had turned herself in to local police on Monday. The Justice Department did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. According to the affidavit filed with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the FBI received a tip from someone who said they were a former romantic partner of Williams. The tipster said Williams ""intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service,"" the affidavit stated. ""The transfer of the computer device to Russia fell through for unknown reasons and Williams still has the computer device or destroyed it,"" according to the affidavit. The investigation remains open. The timing of her initial court appearance was not known. The FBI earlier said it appeared Williams had deactivated her phone number, took down social media accounts and fled an address near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that she shared with her mother. The theft of electronic devices from congressional offices has been a persistent worry following the siege of the Capitol on Jan. 6 by supporters of Trump, who will leave office on Wednesday. Dozens of suspects have been arrested since a crowd egged on by Trump attacked the Capitol in a bid to halt the certification of Presdident-elect Joe Biden's election win. Many took video and photos of themselves taking part in the rampage. Trump was impeached last week by the House for inciting insurrection and now faces trial in the Senate. "
"WASHINGTON: The Pentagon is intensifying efforts to identify and combat white supremacy and other far-right extremism in its ranks as federal investigators seek to determine how many military personnel and veterans joined the violent assault on the Capitol. In the days since a pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, senior leaders of the 2.1 million active-duty and reserve troops have been grappling with fears that former or current service members will be found among the horde. The FBI investigation into the Capitol siege, still in its very early stages, has identified at least six suspects with military links out of the more than 100 people who have been taken into federal custody or the larger number still under investigation. They include a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from Texas, an Army officer from North Carolina and an Army reservist from New Jersey. Another person with military service was shot and killed in the assault. The militaryâs examination of its ranks marks a new urgency for the Pentagon, which has a history of downplaying the rise of white nationalism and right-wing activism, even as Germany and other countries are finding a deep strain embedded in their armed forces. âThese people are not representative of our countryâs military,â Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. He said most active-duty troops and veterans âcontinue to serve honorably and uphold their oath to protect and defend the US Constitution.â For more than a week now, Milley has listened to analysts, read reports and viewed videos of the riots. âThere was some indication that an unknown number of veterans associated with the insurrection,â he said. Milley said he saw rioters carrying military flags. At the rally and later at the Capitol breach, rioters were seen with Marine Corps flags, Army patches and Special Forces insignia. Federal officials are vetting thousands of National Guard troops arriving to help secure the inauguration. Of the 21,500 Guard personnel who had arrived in Washington by Monday, any who will be near President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will receive additional background checks, a standard procedure to counter insider threats that was also taken before President Donald Trumpâs inauguration in 2017. defence Department officials say they are looking into stepping up the monitoring of social media postings from service members, in much the way companies do with their employees. Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed trying to climb through a door in the Capitol, was an Air Force veteran with a robust social media presence. Among the suspects with military ties are Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, another protester at the Capitol, who federal agents say is a neo-Nazi and white supremacist; he also is an Army reservist who works â with secret clearance â at a naval weapons station. Capt. Emily Rainey, an Army officer who told The Associated Press that she had transported 100 people to Washington for the Trump rally, is being investigated by the Army for any connection to the riots, according to a military official. Rainey had resigned from her post last year but was not set to leave until this spring. Milley said he saw reports that âpeople were showing their CAC cards,â a reference to the identification cards used to enter military installations and the Pentagon. Last Tuesday, Milley and the rest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an extraordinary letter to all military personnel, reminding them that Biden would soon be their commander in chief and that they were duty bound to defend the Constitution. The defence department inspector general announced an investigation last week into the effectiveness of Pentagon policies and procedures that prohibited service members from advocacy of or participation in supremacist or extremist groups. The reckoning at the Pentagon comes as retired Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III is poised to become the nationâs first Black defence secretary, an ascension that, depending on how Austin decides to proceed, could either sharpen or blur the US militaryâs decadeslong battles with racial inequality and white supremacy. In his 41-year career in the Army before retiring as a four-star general in 2016, Austin witnessed firsthand both the possibilities and the limitations of how the military deals with race. As an Army officer, he has told of how he had to confront troops with Nazi insignia at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and of countless meetings when he was the only person of color in the room. Now, if he is confirmed as defence secretary, he will have to decide if he will confront the far-right politics that have heightened during four years under Trump. âThis needs to be rooted out of our military,â Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and an Iraq War veteran, said in an interview last week. Austin, she said, âwill be in a unique position to head up that effort.â Austinâs confirmation hearings begin Tuesday, and lawmakers will most likely press him on how he plans to tackle extremism in the ranks. Pentagon officials have known for some time that they have a problem. The defence Department routinely brags that the US military is a microcosm of American society â but officials now acknowledge that if a segment of American society holds white supremacist views, that means there will be a similar segment of the military that does, too. Last year, the FBI notified the defence Department that it had opened criminal investigations involving 143 current or former service members. Of those, 68 were related to domestic extremism cases, according to a senior Pentagon official. The âvast majorityâ involved retired military personnel, many with unfavorable discharge records, the official said. The majority of the domestic extremism cases involved anti-government or anti-authority motivations, including attacks on government facilities and authorities, the official said. One-quarter of the cases were associated with white nationalism. A small number were associated with anti-fascist or anti-abortion motivations. The acting secretary of defence, Christopher C. Miller, directed Pentagon officials last month to toughen policies and regulations banning extremist activities among troops, and update the Uniform Code of Military Justice to specifically address extremist threats. âWe in the Department of defence are doing everything we can to eliminate extremism,â Garry Reid, the Pentagonâs director for defence intelligence, told reporters last week. Reid, however, was unable to outline specifics and declined to address any aspect of active duty membersâ participation at the Capitol. Rising concerns about right-wing activism in the armed forces are not concentrated only in the United States. In Germany, security services counted more than 1,400 cases of suspected far-right extremism among soldiers, police officers and intelligence agents in the three years ending in March, according to a government report released in the fall. The US military, unlike police departments and other law enforcement groups, has the ability to use extremist beliefs to disqualify those seeking to join. But, critics note, it has repeatedly failed to broadly apply those mandates. âThe military has unique abilities to set boundaries on conduct that other parts of government donât have,â said Katrina Mulligan, managing director of national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. âBut they have been unevenly applied.â Military officials and independent specialists say Austin will face a daunting challenge. Pentagon officials concede that despite the checks in place, white supremacist and other far-right groups actively recruit service members or have their own members try to join the military to learn skills and expertise, which also lends legitimacy to their cause. All military personnel, including those in the National Guard, undergo extensive background investigations and physical examinations including assessments of tattoos. Troops are continuously monitored for indications that they are involved in extremist activity and receive training to identify others around them who could be âinsider threats.â But critics say the militaryâs leadership has often failed to hold violators accountable consistently. âCurrent regulations have penalties that are largely left up to commanders, often at the unit level,â Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told a House hearing in February. âThere appears to be no process to track people expelled for ties to white supremacistsâ groups.â At the same time, there are many internal cultural issues within the military â from the recruitment process to training and beyond â that may take years to unravel. The recently approved National defence Authorization Act for fiscal 2021, which sets annual Pentagon policy and spending priorities, contained measures meant to help the department address the issue, including a new position in the defence Department inspector generalâs office: a deputy inspector general for diversity and inclusion and supremacist, extremism and criminal gang activity. Congress also charged the inspector general with establishing a âmechanism to track and reportâ extremist or gang activity in the military. "
"WASHINGTON: First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message Monday as she prepares to leave the White House, saying that ""violence is never the answer,"" weeks after the president's supporters stormed the US Capitol.

""As Donald and I conclude our time in the White House, I think of all of the people I have taken home in my heart and their incredible stories of love, patriotism and determination."" ""Be passionate in everything you do. But always remember that violence is never the answer, and will never be justified,"" she said. ""When I came to the White House, I reflected on the responsibility I have always felt as a mother to encourage, give strength and teach values of kindness."" The Trumps' departure has been fractious, with the president refusing for months to accept the election result due to false allegations of fraud, and declining to congratulate his successor Joe Biden. The outgoing president and his wife have also not invited Biden and his wife Jill for the traditional tea visit in the Oval Office, and will not attend Biden's presidential inauguration on Wednesday. ""The promise of this nation belongs to all of us who do not lose sight of our integrity and values, use every opportunity to show consideration for another person, and build good habits into our daily lives,"" Melania Trump, 50, said. President Donald Trump has been largely out of the public eye since his supporters rampaged through Congress on January 6, triggering his historic second impeachment a week later. "
"SEOUL: South Korea's president on Monday urged the incoming Biden administration to build upon the achievements and learn from the failures of President Donald Trump's diplomatic engagement with North Korea. A dovish liberal and the son of northern war refugees, Moon Jae-in had lobbied hard to help set up Trump's three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but their diplomacy stalemated over disagreements over easing crippling US-led sanctions for the North's disarmament. Biden has accused Trump of chasing the spectacle of summits rather than meaningful curbs on the North's nuclear capabilities. North Korea has a history of staging weapons tests and other provocations to test new U.S. presidents, and Kim vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons program in recent political speeches that were seen as aimed at pressuring the incoming Biden administration. The South Korean leader has been desperate to keep alive a positive atmosphere for dialogue in the face of Kim's vows to further expand a nuclear and missile program that threatens Asian U.S. allies and the American homeland. And while Moon acknowledged that Biden is likely to try a different approach than Trump, he stressed that Biden could still learn from Trump's successes and failures in dealing with North Korea. During a mostly virtual news conference in Seoul, Moon claimed that Kim still had a ``clear willingness'' to denuclearize if Washington and Pyongyang could find mutually agreeable steps to decrease the nuclear threat and ensure the North's security. Most experts see Kim's recent comments as further evidence he will maintain his weapons program to ensure his regime's survival. When asked about the North's efforts to increase its ballistic capacity to strike targets throughout South Korea, including U.S. bases there, Moon said the South could sufficiently cope with such threats with its missile defense systems and other military assets. ``The start of the Biden administration provides a new opportunity to start over talks between North Korea and the United States and also between South and North Korea,'' which have stalled amid the stalemate in nuclear negotiations, Moon said. ``The North Korean efforts to expand its nuclear program and acquire more weapons systems are all because we have not succeeded yet in reaching an agreement over denuclearization and establishing peace. These are problems that could all be solved by success in dialogue,'' he said. During an eight-day congress of North Korea's Workers' Party that ended last week, Kim described the United States as his country's ``foremost principal enemy.'' He didn't entirely rule out talks, but he said the fate of bilateral relations would depend on whether Washington abandons its hostile policy toward Pyongyang. The erosion in inter-Korean relations have been a major setback to Moon, who met Kim three times in 2018 while expressing ambitions to reboot inter-Korean economic engagement when possible, voicing optimism that international sanctions could end and allow such projects. Moon said the South would continue to seek ways to improve relations with the North within the boundary of sanctions, such as pursuing humanitarian assistance and joint anti-virus efforts against COVID-19. But Kim during the ruling party congress already described such offers as ``inessential'' while slamming South Korea for its own efforts to strengthen defense capabilities and continuing annual military exercises with the United States, which were downsized under Trump to create space for diplomacy. Experts say Pyongyang is pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington by halting their joint drills and to defy sanctions and restart inter-Korean economic cooperation. During Trump's first summit with Kim in June 2018, they pledged to improve bilateral relations and issued vague aspirational vows for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. But the negotiations faltered after their second meeting in February 2019 when the Americans rejected the North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for the dismantling of an aging nuclear reactor, which would have amounted to a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Moon said that Trump and Kim's agreement in their first meeting was still relevant and the Biden administration should take lessons from the failures of their second meeting, ``The declaration in Singapore under the Trump administration was a very important declaration for denuclearization and building peace in the Korean Peninsula,'' Moon said. ``Of course, it's very lamentable that the (content of the) declaration remains theoretical because of the failures to back it up with concrete agreements,`` he said. ``But if we start over from the Singapore declaration and revive talks over concrete steps, it's possible that diplomacy between North Korea and the United States and between South and North Korea would gain pace again.'' Moon said he hopes to meet Biden as soon as possible and that South Korean officials were actively communicating with their American counterparts to ensure that the North Korea issue remains a priority for the new U.S. government, which inherits a horrendous coronavirus outbreak and domestic political turmoil.

"The path to beating the coronavirus was clear, but Kelley Vollmar had never felt so helpless. As the top health official in Missouriâs Jefferson County, Vollmar knew a mandate requiring people to wear masks could help save lives. She pressed the governorâs office to issue a statewide order, and hospital leaders were making a similar push. Even the White House, at a time when President Donald Trump was sometimes mocking people who wore masks, was privately urging the Republican governor to impose a mandate. Still, Gov. Mike Parson resisted, and in the suburbs of St Louis, Vollmar found herself under attack. A member of the county health board called her a liar. The sheriff announced that he would not enforce a local mandate. After anti-mask activists posted her address online, Vollmar installed a security system at her home. âThis past year, everything that weâve done has been questioned,â said Vollmar, whose own mother, 77, died from complications of the coronavirus in December. âIt feels like the Lorax from the old Dr Seuss story: Iâm here to save the trees, and nobody is listening.â For nearly the entire pandemic, political polarization and a rejection of science have stymied the United Statesâ ability to control the coronavirus. That has been clearest and most damaging at the federal level, where Trump claimed that the virus would âdisappear,â clashed with his top scientists and, in a pivotal failure, abdicated responsibility for a pandemic that required a national effort to defeat it, handing key decisions over to states under the assumption that they would take on the fight and get the country back to business. But governors and local officials who were left in charge of the crisis squandered the little momentum the country had as they sidelined health experts, ignored warnings from their own advisers and, in some cases, stocked their advisory committees with more business representatives than doctors. Nearly one year since the first known coronavirus case in the United States was announced north of Seattle on Jan. 21, 2020, the full extent of the nationâs failures has come into clear view: The country is hurtling toward 400,000 total deaths, and cases, hospitalizations and deaths have reached record highs, as the nation endures its darkest chapter of the pandemic yet. The situation has turned dire just as the Trump administration, in its final days, begins to see the fruits of perhaps its biggest coronavirus success, the Operation Warp Speed vaccine program. But already, a lack of federal coordination in distributing doses has emerged as a troubling roadblock. The incoming president, Joe Biden, has said he will reassert a federal strategy to bring the virus under control, including a call for everyone to wear masks over the next 100 days and a coordinated plan to widen the delivery of vaccines. âWe will manage the hell out of this operation,â Biden said on Friday. âOur administration will lead with science and scientists.â The strategy signals a shift from the past year, during which the Trump administration largely delegated responsibility for controlling the virus and reopening the economy to 50 governors, fracturing the nationâs response. Interviews with more than 100 health, political and community leaders around the country and a review of emails and other state government records offer a fuller picture of all that went wrong: â The severity of the current outbreak can be traced to the rush to reopen last spring. Many governors moved quickly, sometimes acting over the objections of their advisers. The reopenings nationally led to a surge of new infections that grew over time: Never again would the countryâs average drop below 20,000 new cases a day. â Science was sidelined at every level of government. More than 100 state and local health officials have been fired or have resigned since the beginning of the pandemic. In Florida, leading scientists offered their expertise to the governorâs office but were marginalized, while Gov. Ron DeSantis turned to Dr Scott W. Atlas, a Trump adviser, and others whose views were embraced in conservative circles but rejected by scores of scientists. â While the president publicly downplayed the need for masks, White House officials were privately recommending that certain states with worsening outbreaks require face coverings in public spaces. But records show that at least 26 states ignored recommendations from the White House on masks and other health issues. In South Dakota, Gov. Kristi Noem, boasted to political allies about not requiring masks even as her state was in the midst of an outbreak that became one of the worst in the nation. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado said states had faced difficult choices in balancing the virus â often hearing competing voices on how to do it best â and said Trump had left them without the political support they needed as they urged the public to accept masks and social distancing. âThe single biggest thing that would have made a difference was the clarity of message from the person at the top,â Polis said in an interview. The pandemic indeed came with significant challenges, including record unemployment and a dynamic disease that continued to circle the globe. Without a national strategy from the White House, it is unlikely that any state could have fully stopped the pandemicâs spread. But the majority of deaths in the United States have come since the strategies needed to contain it were clear to state leaders, who had a range of options, from mask orders to targeted shutdowns and increased testing. Disparities have emerged between states that took restrictions seriously and those that did not. America now makes up 4% of the worldâs population but accounts for about 20% of global deaths. While Australia, Japan and South Korea showed it was possible to keep deaths low, the United States â armed with wealth, scientific prowess and global power â became the world leader: it now has one of the highest concentrations of deaths, with nearly twice as many reported fatalities as any other country. <b>Spring</b> <b>The rush to reopen was âthe opportune moment that was lostâ</b> The country once had a chance to set itself on a path to defeat the virus. There had been many early missteps. The United States failed to create a vast testing and contact tracing network in January and February, which could have identified the earliest cases and perhaps held back the crisis. Then, cases silently exploded in New York, while Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio waited crucial days to close schools and businesses. Thousands of lives might have been saved in the New York metropolitan area alone if measures had been in place even a week earlier, researchers found. Driven by the spring surge, New York and New Jersey to this day have the worst death rates in the nation. Elsewhere, though, most of the country had an opportunity to get ahead. By mid-April, most states had resorted to historic stay-at-home orders to avoid the horror seen in the Northeast. At the time, about 30,000 people had died, and the worst of the outbreak was still concentrated in the Northeast. It was during this period that experts say the country had an opportunity to get a handle on the crisis â had it invested in testing and contact tracing and endured a prolonged, if painful, shutdown until cases had been identified and controlled. At the time, the United States was doing only about one-third of the testing researchers thought was necessary. But the White House balked at enforcing its own guidelines, and Trump was openly encouraging states to open up. He turned over control to governors on April 16. âYouâre going to call your own shots,â he told them. Looking back, public health experts trace the bulk of the nationâs cases, now reflected in a record death toll, back to this turning point in late April. âThat was the critical time,â said Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious-disease expert at Columbia University. âThat was the opportune moment that was lost.â In their hurry to get back to business, many governors moved swiftly to reopen and balked at ordering new closures, sometimes ignoring the pleas of local health boards and mayors, according to interviews with health officials and a review of thousands of records obtained under public records law by The New York Times and other groups, such as Accountable. US and the Documenting COVID-19 public record project. In Colorado, a local health official warned that his stateâs reopening plan risked upending the gains made during painful shutdowns. In South Carolina, health officials failed to persuade the governor to delay opening indoor dining and the state epidemiologist, Dr. Linda Bell, suggested in emails, first reported by The State newspaper, that health officials needed to step forward and provide different messages to the public. âI will not âstand next to the governorâ anymore without speaking to what the science tells us is the right thing to do,â she tapped out on her iPhone one Sunday morning. In Iowa, the health director in Black Hawk County, Dr. Nafissa Cisse Egbuonye, was stunned in April when she found employees working elbow to elbow at a Tyson meatpacking plant â only some of them in masks. For weeks, she said, her calls to the governorâs office about closing down the plant went nowhere, as infections rose so steeply that the local hospital was overrun. âWe didnât know where the resistance was occurring, whether it was Tyson or at the state government level,â Egbuonye said. âIt was falling on deaf ears.â Gov Kim Reynolds said at the time that it was essential to keep the nationâs food supply chain up and running. The plant shut down only after the virus had disabled much of its workforce â more than a thousand employees were infected, many of them immigrants, and at least five workers died. Perhaps nowhere were the consequences of reopening clearer than in Texas. With 29 million residents and a conservative identity built upon being friendly for business, Texas was among the states that were later in enacting stay-at-home orders. Within two weeks, protesters were clamoring outside the governorâs mansion, waving flags emblazed with the motto âDonât Tread on Meâ and demanding to be able to go back to work. Gov Greg Abbott was quickly pivoting toward reopening. One day after Trumpâs call handing authority to governors, Abbott announced a âstrike force to open Texas.â More than half of its members had donated to Abbottâs campaigns, including real estate developer Ross Perot Jr. and Drayton McLane Jr., a former owner of the Houston Astros. In a series of phone calls and meetings over the course of several weeks, the strike force hashed out ideas. The Texas Restaurant Association submitted a plan to reopen restaurants. Each step of the way, the ideas were funneled through a panel of four medical experts, who were empowered to veto ideas. But the task before them was clear: how to get Texasâ $1.8 trillion economy up and running again. By late April, Abbott was considering opening up the economy in phases. âMy advice was to go a bit slower,â said one member of the governorâs team, Dr. Mark McClellan, a former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration. He worried that the state was not allowing time between phases to measure any upticks in infection before progressing through further reopenings, and he feared a surge in new infections. But on May 1, Texas opened back up, starting with restaurants, stores and movie theaters. By Memorial Day, Texas was effectively up and running. A spokesman for Abbott pointed to states like California and New York, which kept restrictions in place for longer but have recently seen resurgences of the virus, as evidence that âlockdowns for months after monthsâ do not work. He said Abbott had balanced âsaving lives, while preserving livelihoods.â From late May to late July, new infections in Texas soared tenfold, from around 1,000 new cases a day to as many as 10,000. âIt was like a wildfire in brush,â said Dr. Jose Vazquez, who served as the health authority in Starr County, Texas, and who contracted the virus himself as the stateâs Southern border region was hard hit over the summer. By late June, Abbott called another meeting of his medical advisers. Reversing course, he shut down bars. Days later, he issued a mask order, which was credited with saving lives in the months to come. Deaths continued to soar into August, and for weeks this summer, Vazquez watched as helicopters swooped into Starr County to pick up patients, taking them to hospitals as far away as Oklahoma and New Mexico. Few returned alive. Summer âIt was just horrificâ: Health experts were exhausted, threatened and sidelined</b> Summer was supposed to bring a reprieve from the horror. Across the Northeast, deaths were subsiding. The weather was growing warm, a chance to spend more time outdoors, where the virus spreads less easily. Health officials hoped the season would be the bridge they needed to prepare for the fall, when infections were expected to worsen. Instead, as officials in New Zealand were recording 100 days in a row without a single new infection and countries like Germany were recording only a few new deaths per day, the United States nearly broke its spring coronavirus hospitalization record. Around the country, health officials who had been steering their communities through the crisis were increasingly facing harassment, dwindling resources and political battles that left them exhausted. The reaction reflected the tone set by Trump, who demanded loyalty from Republican allies and whose rhetoric on masks and the economy became a rallying cry in many communities. Amid the chaos of the year, dozens of health officials were fired or resigned. Amber Elliott, the former health director for St. Francois County, Missouri, said she had received calls from people spewing âcurse words, and, âYou better watch out,â â and a photograph of her family at her sonâs baseball game was taken without her knowledge and posted online. She began checking security cameras before leaving her office in the evenings, and she eventually resigned. âItâs not worth their safety,â she said, citing the risk to her two young children. âYou donât wait until itâs too late.â In Wisconsin, Dr Jeanette Kowalik, the health commissioner in Milwaukee, was worn down by a lack of resources. People in her office had been working 20-hour days, struggling to keep up with growing caseloads and dealing with cumbersome technology that reflected a public health system that had been underfunded for years. âIt was just horrific,â Kowalik said. âYou couldnât keep up.â At one point, Kowalik sent a plea for help to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to records. It took the CDC six weeks to respond. In Kansas, Dr Gianfranco Pezzino, the health officer for Shawnee County, was growing frustrated as commissioners in the county relaxed mask restrictions for the farmersâ market and later extended bar hours and allowed youth sports practices, against his advice. Tired and increasingly frustrated, Pezzino sat down at his desk and drafted his resignation letter. âYou canât put public health professionals in charge of making these difficult decisions and then overrule them based on no data,â said Pezzino, who, in a moment characteristic of the pandemic, read the letter aloud during a video meeting last month and then turned off his camera to leave. At the beginning of the pandemic, the Florida Department of Health convened top experts for an urgent, Saturday morning teleconference with the state surgeon general, Dr Scott A. Rivkees. âWe had this bang-up meeting,â said Dr Aileen M. Marty, an infectious-disease professor at Florida International University who assumed the meeting would be the first of many. Instead, it was the only one. Rivkees was later sidelined, little to be seen after correctly suggesting at a news conference that social distancing and other measures would need to be in place for at least a year. Another group of scientists that met within the Health Department was also phased out. DeSantis, the governor who owed his 2018 election in large part to Trumpâs early endorsement, was hewing closely to the White Houseâs messaging, and increasingly surrounded himself with business leaders and advisers of his own choosing. Of 22 people on the executive committee of the governorâs task force to reopen Florida, only one, the president of Tampa General Hospital, came from a health care background. None of the others were doctors. One person DeSantis did turn to was Atlas, at the time a high-profile adviser to Trump whose views had been described as dangerous by members of the medical establishment. A radiologist whose appearances on Fox News caught the presidentâs eye, Atlas frequently clashed with leading health experts, arguing, for example, that the science of mask wearing was uncertain and that children could not spread the coronavirus. DeSantis and Atlas appeared together at events across Florida in late August, promoting in-person instruction at schools and colleges, including the return of fall sports. A spokesperson for DeSantis credited him as an innovator who understood that lockdowns were âineffective,â had come up with a data-driven approach and had remained âsingularly focusedâ on protecting older residents and others most at risk of dying. In September, DeSantisâ office placed a call to Dr Jay Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford who had criticized coronavirus lockdowns as harmful. In an interview, Bhattacharya said the call had come more or less out of the blue, and he was pleasantly surprised to learn that the governor seemed to have studied his work. The governor asked Bhattacharya to appear on a panel, along with Dr Martin Kulldorff from Harvard, who with Bhattacharya went on to help draft the so-called Great Barrington Declaration, a treatise that calls for better protecting the vulnerable while others in society âresume life as normal,â an approach that has been fiercely criticized within the scientific community. The next day, DeSantis moved forward with a plan to keep Florida open. He allowed restaurants and bars to operate at full capacity, and he prohibited local governments from enforcing mask mandates, curfews and other restrictions. The country had just exceeded 200,000 deaths, including more than 14,000 in Florida. It was a devastating toll, but one that would soon worsen. Fall The science of masks was well-documented, but governors resisted By fall, Trumpâs own coronavirus diagnosis was dominating headlines, and he was still insisting that the country was ârounding the cornerâ in the pandemic and that the virus would soon âdisappear.â But inside the White House, health officials knew more was needed to control the crisis. In a series of unpublicized weekly memos tailored to each state, the White Houseâs coronavirus task force had been privately pressuring states to do more. The reports recommended that states like Alaska, Georgia and Wyoming embrace face masks. States like Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi were advised to put more stringent limits on indoor dining. But those states and others â at least 26 in all â ignored the urgings of the White House, even when new cases were ticking upward. For Noem, the governor of South Dakota, the laissez-faire approach was a point of pride. More than perhaps any other state, South Dakota had kept its doors open, hosting Trump for an event at Mount Rushmore and committing $5 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to enticing tourists. In the fall, Noem traveled the country with the help of a former Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, eager to showcase that her brand of liberty governance was the right one. In New Hampshire, she told a group of Republicans that one of her strategies was that she ânever talked about the number of cases of COVID-19 that we have.â In Maine, Noem criticized the stateâs restrictions while claiming that her stateâs death rate was among the lowest. âLeadership has consequences, and you are all living under some very poor leadership out of your governorâs office,â Noem told the crowd. In fact, new cases and deaths have been climbing in South Dakota. A rally that drew hundreds of thousands of motorcyclists to Sturgis, South Dakota, over the summer is believed to have contributed, in addition to colder weather that pushed many indoors. Noem also continued to resist a mask order despite urging from the White House. South Dakota ended the year with one of the highest death rates in the nation â four times Maineâs â though it also mounted one the nationâs most successful vaccination efforts. Idahoâs governor, Brad Little, also resisted a mask order, but behind the scenes, he appeared to acknowledge that such action was needed. Bryan Elliot, who heads the health board in a heavily hit region in southwest Idaho, said two of Littleâs advisers had joined a conference call with two board officials to press them to embrace more control measures, including masks. The request, Elliot said, included a threat. Any such measure was bound to spark a public backlash, and the intention, it seemed, was that Elliotâs board would absorb it. If the region did not impose a mask order, the state advisers told Elliot, the governorâs office would publicly shame him as being responsible for the case numbers. âIt was not appropriate,â Elliot said. The decision to further delegate responsibility to local officials opened the door, as it had in many states, to politics and misinformation. A woman invited to testify at one board meeting, Dr Vicki Wooll, suggested that it was 5G cellphone networks that were putting peopleâs health at risk. One state over, Dr Ed Zimmerman, the health officer in Washakie County, Wyoming, saw his community being inflamed by other conspiracy theories on social media, including suggestions that virus fears had been overblown in an effort to harm Trumpâs reelection campaign. âItâs a complete relegation of science to the back burner,â said Zimmerman, who described himself as conservative. A week after ordering a mask mandate, he was fired. Winter A bleak season brings record deaths Against the odds, some states have managed to keep the virus under control. Washington state, which recorded 37 of the nationâs first 50 coronavirus deaths, has kept in place a steadily adjusting suite of mitigation measures and now ranks 44th in deaths per capita. If the nation had achieved a rate comparable to Washingtonâs, about 220,000 fewer people would be dead. Vermont has also been among the states with the fewest deaths, thanks in part to a cautious reopening, significant testing and a mask order. But a year of political division and uncontrolled coronavirus spread has caught up to most of the country. In recent days, the virus has been accelerating in nearly every state, and deaths have been climbing from Arizona to Connecticut. Even New York, which became a national model for virus restrictions and testing after its spring crisis, is seeing a resurgence. Winter was always the season in which the virus posed the biggest threat, but in many states, residents have also fallen victim to pandemic fatigue, rendering existing controls less effective. That has been the case in California, which is now experiencing one of the worst outbreaks in the nation. The most populous US state was the first to issue a stay-at-home order last spring, and it managed to keep the virus in check for most of the year. But as winter approached, a restlessness set in. Local journalists exposed how the Democratic leaders Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor London Breed of San Francisco â outspoken advocates for virus precautions â had attended birthday parties at the French Laundry restaurant in the Napa Valley, ignoring their own best practices. Disdain for masks and business closures resonated in more conservative parts of Southern California, and health officials pointed to people who had let their guard down at Thanksgiving as a turning point. Now federal health officials are warning that a much more contagious variant of the virus could become the dominant source of infection by March, threatening to accelerate the countryâs outbreak. The arrival of vaccines could slow the spread, but the lack of a unified national strategy has resurfaced again as a fundamental flaw. The federal government has pushed the responsibility for administering vaccines to state and local governments, who are strapped for funding and still dealing with daunting virus caseloads. Some states have struggled to deliver the vaccine swiftly, and rules vary widely from state to state. Biden, who takes office this week, said he would call on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to establish 100 federally supported vaccination centers around the country and would also push for thousands of community and mobile vaccination sites. But tight supplies will limit how quickly any such plans can be rolled out, and already there are political divisions over whether to trust the vaccine and what social groups should get it first. Dr Marissa J. Levine, the director of the Center for Leadership in Public Health Practice at the University of South Florida, said that a failure of leadership â first from the White House, and later from the states â had polarized the entire response to the pandemic and given the virus an extended life. âThe toll points to a colossal failure at every level of government,â she said. The top five worst days for new deaths in the United States have come in January. As the calendar page turned for a new year, the virus was worse than it had ever been. "
"WASHINGTON: A New York Times report that President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income tax the year he entered the White House - and, thanks to colossal losses, no income tax at all in 11 of the 18 years that the Times reviewed - served to raise doubts about Trump's self-image as a shrewd and successful businessman.  That Sunday's report came just weeks before Trump's re-election bid served to intensify the spotlight on Trump the businessman - an identity that he has spent decades cultivating and that helped him capture the presidency four years ago in his first run for political office. The Times' report deepens the uncertainty surrounding a tumultuous presidential campaign set against the backdrop of a viral pandemic, racial unrest in American cities and a ferocious battle over the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Since entering the White House, Trump has broken with tradition set by his predecessors by not only refusing to release his tax returns but by waging a legal battle to keep them hidden. The Times report suggests why that might have been so. It reported that many of Trump's top businesses are losing money, even as those losses have helped him shrink his federal tax bill to essentially nothing.  Eugene Steuerle, a tax expert at the Urban Institute, said he wasn't surprised that it turns out that Trump had paid almost no federal income tax. Most commercial real estate developers deduct large interest payments on their debts from taxable income, thereby lowering their tax bills. Typically, they also often avoid capital gains taxes by plowing profits from the sale of one building into the purchase of another.  ""Most tax experts expected you would find little in the way of tax payments by President Trump,"" said Steuerle, who served as a Treasury Department official under President Ronald Reagan.  The Times noted that Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said of the Times report that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"" and asked for the documents on which the reporting was based, which the Times declined to provide in order to protect its sources. The Times said Garten then directly disputed only the amount of taxes Trump had paid.  Here are some key takeaways from the Times' reporting: TRUMP PAID JUST $750 IN TAXES IN BOTH 2016 and 2017. The newspaper said Trump initially paid $95 million in taxes over the 18 years it studied. But he managed to recover most of that money by claiming - and receiving - a stunning $72.9 million federal tax refund. According to the Times, Trump also pocketed $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which are typically based on federal filings.  Trump's outsize refund became the subject of a now-long-standing Internal Revenue Service audit of his finances. The audit was widely known. Trump has claimed it was the very reason why he cannot release his returns. But the Times report is the first to identify the issue that was mainly in dispute.  As a result of the refund, Trump paid an average $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2000 to 2017, the Times reported. By contrast, the average U.S. taxpayer in the top .001% of earners paid about $25 million annually over the same timeframe. TRUMP HAS FINANCED AN EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLE WITH THE USE OF BUSINESS EXPENSES. From his homes, his aircraft - and $70,000 on hair styling during his television show ""The Apprentice"" - Trump has capitalized on cost incurred from his businesses to finance a luxurious lifestyle.  The Times noted that Trump's homes, planes and golf courses are part of the Trump family business and, as such, Trump classified them as business expenses as well. Because companies can write off business expenses as deductions, all such expenses have helped reduce Trump's tax liability. MANY OF HIS BEST-KNOWN BUSINESSES ARE MONEY-LOSERS The president has frequently pointed to his far-flung hotels, golf courses and resorts as evidence of his success as a developer and businessman. Yet these properties have been been draining money.  The Times reported that Trump has claimed $315 million in losses since 2000 on his golf courses, including the Trump National Doral near Miami, which Trump has portrayed as a crown jewel in his business empire. Likewise, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has lost $55 million, the Times reported. FOREIGN VISITORS HAVE HELPED SUPPORT TRUMP'S PROPERTIES Since Trump began his presidential run, lobbyists, foreign governments and politicians have lavished significant sums of money on his properties, a spending spree that raised questions about its propriety and legality.  The Times report illustrates just how much that spending has been: Since 2015, his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has taken in $5 million more a year from a surge in membership. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association spent at least $397,602 in 2017 at Trump's Washington hotel. Overseas projects have produced millions more for Trump - $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey. TRUMP WILL FACE FINANCIAL PRESSURE AS DEBTS COME DUE Trump seems sure to face heavy financial pressures from the enormous pile of debt he has absorbed. The Times said the president appears to be responsible for $421 million in loans, most of which will come due within four years. On top of that, a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower in New York will come due in 2022. "
"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: The Trump administration notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel, that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the Chinese company and intends to reject dozens of other applications to supply the telecommunications firm, people familiar with the matter said. The action - likely the last against Huawei Technologies under Republican President Donald Trump - is the latest in a long-running effort to weaken the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which Washington sees as a national security threat. The notices came amid a flurry of US efforts against China in the final days of Trump's administration. Democrat Joe Biden will take the oath of office as president on Wednesday. Huawei and Intel Corp declined to comment. Commerce said it could not comment on specific licensing decisions, but said the department continues to work with other agencies to ""consistently"" apply licensing policies in a way that ""protects US national security and foreign policy interests."" In an email documenting the actions, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Friday the Commerce Department had issued ""intents to deny a significant number of license requests for exports to Huawei and a revocation of at least one previously issued license."" Sources familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was more than one revocation. One of the sources said eight licenses were yanked from four companies. The news triggered moderate profit-taking in some semiconductor related shares in Asia. Korea's Samsung Electronics fell 1.5% while Japan's Advantest shed 1.5% and Tokyo Electron lost 0.8%. Japanese flash memory chip maker Kioxia Corp had at least one license revoked, two of the sources said. The company, formerly known as Toshiba Memory Corp, said it does not ""disclose business details regarding specific products or customers."" The semiconductor association's email said the actions spanned a ""broad range"" of products in the semiconductor industry and asked companies whether they had received notices. The email noted that companies had been waiting ""many months"" for licensing decisions, and with less than a week left in the administration, dealing with the denials was a challenge. A spokesman for the semiconductor group did not respond to a request for comment. Companies that received the ""intent to deny"" notices have 20 days to respond, and the Commerce Department has 45 days to advise them of any change in a decision or it becomes final. Companies would then have another 45 days to appeal. The United States put Huawei on a commerce department ""entity list"" in May 2019, restricting suppliers from selling US goods and technology to it. But some sales were allowed and others denied while the United States intensified its crackdown on the company, in part by expanding US authority to require licenses for sales of semiconductors made abroad with American technology. Before the latest action, some 150 licenses were pending for $120 billion worth of goods and technology, which had been held up because various US agencies could not agree on whether they should be granted, a person familiar with the matter said. Another $280 billion of license applications for goods and technology for Huawei still have not been processed, the source said, but now are more likely to be denied. Intel Corp has received licences from US authorities to continue supplying certain products to Huawei Technologies, an Intel spokesman said in September last year. An August rule said that products with 5G capabilities were likely to be rejected, but sales of less sophisticated technology would be decided on a case-by-case basis. The United States made the latest decisions during a half dozen meetings starting on January 4 with senior officials from the departments of commerce, state, defence and energy, the source said. The officials developed detailed guidance with regard to which technologies were capable of 5G, and then applied that standard, the person added. That meant issuing denials for the vast majority of the roughly 150 disputed applications, and revoking the eight licenses to make those consistent with the latest denials, the source said. The US action came after pressure from a recent Trump appointee in the commerce department, Corey Stewart, who wanted to push through hardline China policies after being hired for a two-month stint in the agency at the end of the administration. Trump has targeted Huawei in other ways. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada in December 2018, on a US warrant. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the company itself were indicted for misleading banks about its business in Iran. Meng has said she is innocent. Huawei has denied the claims of spying and pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which also includes charges of violating US sanctions against Iran and conspiring to steal trade secrets from American technology companies.

"AHMEDABAD: As US President Donald Trump prepares to exit the White House, it has emerged that his trip to Ahmedabad left the AMC with a bill totalling Rs 9.01 crore. An RTI applicant in Ahmedabad has been provided a detailed list of the costs incurred by the municipal corporation during the âNamaste Trumpâ visit on February 24-25 last year. The costs relate to sprucing up some sites in the city and for publicity material placed along Trumpâs route to Motera Stadium and Sabarmati Ashram. The RTI applicant had been trying for months to get this information and was finally given the billed amount as the financial year drew to a close. On February 29, 2020, the state government had reported to the assembly that in all just Rs 12.5 crore was spent on Trumpâs visit â Rs 8 crore from the state and Rs 4.5 crore from the AMC coffers. âBut the expenses show otherwise. The AMC had spent Rs 7.86 crore mainly on road repairs, route upgrade, and for ferrying people to Motera Stadium,â said the RTI applicant, Raj Sisodiya. âThe documents clearly show how speedy approvals were given for minor civic works.â What Sisodiya has not been told is the amount billed for the publicity of the event. Earlier, TOI had reported that Rs 6 crore was spent on beautification of the city, Rs 4 crore on artists and volunteers for the grand show, and Rs 7 crore on arranging state and private transport to ferry people to Motera Stadium. Nearly 17 road stretches were reportedly resurfaced and repaired ahead of Trumpâs visit. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has confirmed his participation in the presidential debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden later this week, even as he raised objections about ""unfair"" changes in the format. Trump, 74, and Biden, 77, are slated to face their final presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee on October 22. The non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) on Monday announced new rules under which it will mute microphones for two minutes of the rival speakers so as to give them uninterrupted opening remarks. ""I'll participate, I just think it is very unfair,â Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday. ""I will participate, but it's very unfair that they changed the topics and it is very unfair that again we have an anchor who is totally biased,"" the president said, responding to a question on changes in the debate rules by CPD. In a letter to CPD on Monday, Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien expressed concern over the announced topics for what was always billed as the 'Foreign Policy Debate' in the series of events agreed to by both the Trump and the Biden campaigns many months ago. ""The topics announced by moderator Kristen Welker (fighting COVID-19, American families, race in America, climate change, national security, and leadership) are serious and worthy of discussion, but only a few of them even touch on foreign policy,â he said, asserting that almost all of the topics were discussed at length during the first debate ""won"" by Trump. Under the new rules, Trump and Biden will each have two minutes of uninterrupted time to speak at the beginning of every 15-minute segment of the debate ""The only candidate whose microphone will be open during these two-minute periods is the candidate who has the floor under the rules,"" the commission said in a statement on Monday. ""For the balance of each segment, which by design is intended to be dedicated to open discussion, both candidates' microphones will be open,"" it said. The commission said both campaigns have agreed to the two-minute, uninterrupted rule. The decision to mute microphones comes after a chaotic first presidential debate that saw the two candidates interrupting each other repeatedly. The September 29 debate, moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, was widely criticised for its off-the-rails nature. The second presidential debate set for October 15 was cancelled after Trump refused to do a virtual face-off with his Democratic challenger despite concerns over his COVID-19 diagnosis. The presidential rivals separately held competing town halls last week instead. The third and final debate will be moderated by NBC News correspondent Kristen Welker. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has predicted that the American economy will soon recover from the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown and that the next year will be the greatest economic year in the country's history. Republican incumbent Trump faces a stiff challenge from the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, Joe biden, in the November 3 elections. The handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic condition and racial tensions have emerged as the main poll topics. âNext year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, that's what's going to happen,â Trump said at an election rally in Arizona, a battleground state, on Monday. The coronavirus has claimed 220,119 lives with over 8.2 million confirmed infections in the US. The pandemic has also resulted in one of the greatest recessions and job losses in the country's history. Of the 22 million jobs that were lost in early spring, 11 million jobs have been recovered. The budget deficit is at an all-time high of $3.1 trillion. Acknowledging that the country was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus, Trump promised his supporters that the country will soon get back to normal life. âThat's what we want, just a normal. Just seven months ago (is where) we want to get back (to) and we will be better than that very soon, we build a foundation that (is) so strong and you see what's happening, (the) stock market (is going) through the roof,â he said. âWe saved millions of lives by doing what we did and we built it (the economy) back up and it's a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare,â Trump said as he continued with his criticism of Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris. âThat's what it is. Biden will postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, and shut down our country and we are opening and we are opening rapidly and we've got a V (victory) shape. It may be a super V. It looks like it's a super V which nobody ever even heard of before,â he said. The president alleged that a Biden administration would massively raise taxes. âYou will be buried in regulations. You know we cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved, we have it down to one year and you know what from two to one very shortly to be exact,â he asserted. The Biden administration, he said, will bring all of those regulations back. âThey want to dismantle your police departments,â he said. Trump alleged that Harris is a left liberal. âBiden even chose as his running mate the most liberal senator in America. Senator Kamala Harris is a sponsor of the socialist Green New Deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans,â he said. The Green New Deal is a Congressional resolution which aims to tackle factors contributing to global warming. âHarris also urged her supporters to donate to a fund that build out the rioters, the ones that knocked out your towns, your cities, not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas,â Trump alleged, referring to the race protests after George Floyd's death in police custody. ""Joe Biden is a servant of the left-wing globalists and lobbyists, the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, they (Democrats) raise a lot of money. You know why? Because they make deals. They make deals,â he alleged. Trump said, if he wants, he can raise money for his campaign pretty soon and with ease. âI would be the greatest fundraiser in history if I wanted to call Wall Street. I know them all. 'I want $10 million for my campaign.' - 'Yes, sir.' All I have to say is I want $10 million, I want $15 million, I want $25 million. I would set every record,â he said. âIn 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment and you elected an outsider as president, who is finally putting America first. About time. It's about time. It's about time. Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And you know what? You knew that, a lot of people knew it for a long time,â he said. âAnd as far as I'm concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that's what it is. It's a criminal enterprise,â Trump said alleging that the mainstream media and the Big tech companies were trying to hide the entire corruption. "
"WASHINGTON: US law enforcement officials are gearing up for pro-Trump marches in all 50 state capitals this weekend, erecting barriers and calling in their National Guards to try to prevent the kind of violent attack that rattled the nation on January 6. The FBI has warned police agencies of possible armed protests at all 50 state capitols starting January 16 through President-elect Joe Bidenâs inauguration on January 20, fuelled by supporters of President Donald Trump who believe his false claims of electoral fraud. Michigan, Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington are among the states that have activated their National Guards to strengthen security, while Texas took the step of closing its Capitol from Saturday through Inauguration Day. Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a statement late Friday that intelligence indicated âviolent extremistsâ may seek to exploit planned armed protests in Austin to âconduct criminal acts.â The scramble follows the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol in Washington by a mix of extremists and Trump supporters. Law enforcement officials have trained much of their focus on Sunday, when the anti-government âboogalooâ movement has flagged plans to hold rallies in all 50 states. In Michigan a fence was erected around the Capitol building in Lansing and troopers were mobilized from across the state to bolster security. The legislature nevertheless canceled meetings next week, citing concern over credible threats. âWe are prepared for the worst but we remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate at our Capitol do so peacefully,â Michigan State Police Director Joe Gasper told a news conference on Friday.

"As he prepares to end a tumultuous four years as US president facing potential legal jeopardy, Donald Trump has discussed the possibility of pardoning himself, according to a source familiar with the matter. But there are questions about whether a president's broad executive clemency powers under the US Constitution would permit such action. The Justice Department has previously taken the view that the Constitution does not allow a sitting president to be indicted, but a former president enjoys no such protections. Here is an explanation of the potential constitutional problems with a self-pardon and why such action would not end Trump's legal jeopardy after his term ends on Wednesday. Is a self-pardon constitutional?There is no definitive answer to this question, and the Constitution does not explicitly address this possibility. No president has tried it before, so the courts have not weighed in. Trump wrote on Twitter in 2018 that he had the ""absolute right"" to pardon himself. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of a self-pardon. Many scholars have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the basic principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case. Others have argued that a self-pardon is constitutional because the pardon power is very broadly worded in the Constitution. Historical texts made clear that the nation's 18th century founders discussed self-pardons, but opted not to include an explicit limitation on that power. The Constitution states that a president ""shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment."" The common usage and history of the words ""grant"" and ""pardon"" imply a president's power under the clause is limited to issuing pardons to other people, according to University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman. The last time the Justice Department explored the question was in a 1974 memo by a lawyer in its Office of Legal Counsel that concluded that it would be unconstitutional for then-President Richard Nixon to pardon himself. Nixon resigned that year amid the Watergate political scandal. ""Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself,"" the Justice Department lawyer wrote. But the memo argued that Nixon could temporarily step down, be pardoned by his then-vice president, and then resume power. The 1974 memo does not have any legal authority. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes. How might a self-pardon be tested in court?Under US law, courts do not issue advisory opinions. For a court to rule on a self-pardon's validity, the Justice Department would need to charge Trump with a crime, and then he would need to invoke the pardon as a defense, legal experts said. A self-pardon might only embolden prosecutors to bring a case against Trump because it would suggest he is hiding something, said law professor Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School in California. Why would Trump pardon himself?He may face criminal liability on several fronts. Some legal experts have pointed to Trump's Jan. 2 phone call in which he pressured Georgia's top election official to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his Nov. 3 election loss to President-elect Joe Biden in the state. They said the call could have violated a federal and a state law. A Georgia law against ""criminal solicitation to commit election fraud"" makes it illegal for a person to intentionally solicit, request, command or otherwise attempt to cause another person to engage in election fraud. A separate federal law makes it illegal to attempt to ""deprive or defraud"" people of a ""fair and impartially conducted election process."" Trump would likely argue that he merely expressed his personal opinions to the official, and did not order him to interfere with the election. Some lawyers have said Trump could be in legal jeopardy for an incendiary speech he gave to thousands of supporters on Jan. 6, shortly before a mob descended on the US Capitol and disrupted congressional certification of Biden's victory, sending lawmakers into hiding and leaving five people dead. Trump could make a strong case that his remarks were protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free speech, other lawyers said. Trump could be targeted by prosecutors for violations of state laws. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance already is spearheading a tax-fraud investigation into Trump's businesses, though no charges have yet been brought. Trump has called the investigation politically motivated. How broadly could a self-pardon be worded?There is precedent for very broadly worded pardons. Nixon eventually received a ""full and unconditional pardon"" from his successor, Gerald Ford. The pardon cleared Nixon for ""any crimes that he might have committed against the United States as president."" The US Supreme Court has never ruled on whether such a broad pardon is lawful. Some scholars have argued that the nation's founders intended for pardons to be specific, and that there is an implied limit on their scope. Could a pardon be preemptive?A pardon cannot cover future conduct, but a pardon can be preemptive in the sense that it can cover conduct that has not yet resulted in legal proceedings. The Nixon pardon is an example, and there are others. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter preemptively pardoned hundreds of thousands of ""draft dodgers"" who avoided a government-imposed obligation to serve in the Vietnam War. "
"PENNSYLVANIA: Pennsylvania officials can certify election results that currently show Democrat Joe Biden winning the state by more than 80,000 votes, a federal judge ruled, dealing President Donald Trump's campaign another blow in its effort to invalidate the election. US Middle District Judge Matthew Brann in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on Saturday turned down the request for an injunction by President Donald Trump's campaign, dealing a sharp blow to the incumbent's hopes of somehow overturning the results of the presidential contest. Trump had argued that the US Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law was violated when Pennsylvania counties took different approaches to notifying voters before the election about technical problems with their submitted mail-in ballots. Pennsylvania secretary of state Kathy Boockvar and the seven Biden-majority counties that the campaign sued had argued Trump had previously raised similar claims and lost. They told Brann the remedy the Trump campaign sought, to throw out millions of votes over alleged isolated issues, was far too extreme, particularly after most of them have been tallied. âThere is no justification on any level for the radical disenfranchisement they seek,â Boockvar's lawyers wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The state's 20 electoral votes would not have been enough on their own to hand Trump a second term. Counties must certify their results to Boockvar by Monday, after which she will make her own certification. Democratic Governor Tom Wolf will notify the winning candidate's electors they should appear to vote in the Capitol on December 14. "
"NEW YORK: With the US presidential election looming, lawyers for Donald Trump will ask a federal appeals court on Friday to block Manhattan's top prosecutor from obtaining the president's tax returns in connection with a criminal probe into Trump and his businesses. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments from lawyers for Trump and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, whose investigation began more than two years ago. The probe has been stalled as Trump fights an Aug. 2019 grand jury subpoena to his accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of his corporate and personal tax returns. Vance began his probe after Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen paid hush money to silence two women before the 2016 election about claimed sexual encounters with Trump. The probe now appears to go beyond the payments, with Vance saying in court filings he might have grounds to investigate Trump and his businesses for tax and insurance fraud, and that possible bank fraud might also be examined. Trump's lawyers have said the subpoena was ""wildly overbroad,"" issued in bad faith, and part of a ""fishing expedition"" designed to harass him. Vance is a Democrat, and Trump is a Republican. Friday's arguments follow the US Supreme Court's July 9 rejection of Trump's claim he was absolutely immune from criminal probes while in the White House. The Supreme Court said Trump could raise other challenges to the subpoena. Trump has said he expects a return to that court if the appeals court rules against him, as it did last November. In an Aug. 20 ruling, US District Judge Victor Marrero said Vance should obtain the returns, saying Trump's effort to prolong the dispute could cause statutes of limitations to run out and give him the immunity the Supreme Court rejected. ""Justice requires an end to this controversy,"" Marrero wrote. Trump's lawyers want the case returned to Marrero so he can review the substance of the president's arguments, rather than treat them as a repackaging of his immunity claim. Though the appeal was fast-tracked, the public will likely not know what's in Trump's tax returns before the Nov. 3 election. Grand jury proceedings are secret, and if Vance gets the returns it could be months before their contents become public. All three judges on the appeals court panel were appointed by Democratic presidents, as was Marrero. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Saturday his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is doing ""very well"" in quarantine after becoming infected with the coronavirus. ""My son Donald is doing very well. Thank you!'' the president tweeted, following Friday's disclosure that the 42-year-old Trump scion had become one of the nearly 12 million Americans infected by the virus. More than 250,000 Americans have lost their lives to the virus, the highest death toll of any country. Donald Trump Jr. learned of his positive test result earlier this week, has had no symptoms and was following all medically recommended guidelines for treating the illness, said a spokesperson, who was granted anonymity to discuss private medical information. President-elect Joe Biden made President Trump's response to the virus a top issue in the recently concluded race for the White House, though Trump has yet to acknowledge the outcome. President Trump, first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron have all recovered from their coronavirus infections in October. The president spent three days in a military hospital, where he was treated with experimental drugs; the first lady weathered her illness at the White House. Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the coronavirus in July. Scores of people who work for or associate with the president have also recovered from recent infections, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. "
"NEW YORK: A Manhattan judge has tossed out a defamation lawsuit against Fox News brought by the former Playboy model who took a USD 150,000 payoff to squelch her story of an affair with a pre-presidency Donald Trump. Karen McDougal had alleged in the suit filed late last year that Fox host Tucker Carlson slandered her by calling the payout ""a classic case of extortion."" U.S. District Court Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil ruled on Thursday that McDougal failed to prove that Carlson was accusing her of an actual crime in a way that would back up a defamation claim. The judge called the on-air remarks ""rhetorical hyperbole and opinion commentary intended to frame a political debate, and as such, are not actionable as defamation,"" the judge said in a written ruling. In an email to The Associated Press, McDougal zeroed in on the part of the ruling that found her claim didn't meet the legal standard showing there was malice by Carlson. ""I believe reporting something you know is a lie as 'news' or 'undisputed facts' is the very definition of malicious,"" she wrote. A statement from Fox called the decision a victory both for the network and ""all defenders of the First Amendment."" McDougal has said she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007. He denied it. As the Republican ran for office in 2016, National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc. paid McDougal USD 150,000 for the rights to her story, which it never published. The company eventually acknowledged the purchase was a ""catch-and-kill"" maneuver to help the presidential prospects of Trump. Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen ended up pleading guilty to campaign finance violations in connection with payments to silence McDougal. AMI, in a deal to avoid federal prosecution, admitted to making the payment ""in concert"" with the Trump campaign. Carlson was discussing the Cohen case on Dec. 10, 2018, when the host recounted what he called ""undisputed"" facts: that two women had ""approached Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if he doesn't give them money."" ""Now, that sounds like a classic case of extortion,"" Carlson added. The decision siding with Fox on Thursday called it ""the kind of pitched commentary that one expects when tuning in to talk shows like Tucker Carlson Tonight, with pundits debating the latest political controversies.""

"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump will leave Washington next Wednesday morning, ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, according to a person familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been made public. Trump had already announced that he would not be attending Biden's inauguration - breaking tradition - after spending months making baseless allegations of voter fraud in an attempt to delegitimize Biden's presidency. Vice President Mike Pence will attend in his place. Trump is expected to remain in Florida with a small group of aides. "
"WASHINGTON: Robert Trump, the younger brother of Donald Trump, has died, a day after the president visited his ""best friend"" in a New York hospital.  President Trump made a last-minute trip to New York on Friday to meet his ailing 71-year-old brother.  ""It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight. He was not just my brother, he was my best friend,"" Trump, 74, said in a late-night statement on Saturday.  ""He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace,"" Trump said.  Robert, who took blood thinners, had experienced brain bleeds that began after a recent fall, The New York Times quoted a close friend of the family's.  He had been in poor health since last month. He was recently admitted to the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan where he breathed his last.  Earlier in the day, Trump described Robert, who was born two years after Trump and was a business executive and real estate developer, as a wonderful brother.  ""We've had a great relationship for a long time, from Day 1, a long time ago,"" Trump said.  The two had an estranged relationship for years, before Trump ran for the White House, the daily said.  Trump is expected to attend his brother's funeral. However, no details were immediately available on his plans.  ""Uncle Robert, we love you. You are in our hearts and prayers, always,"" Ivanka Trump posted on Twitter Saturday night.  The president called his brother's hospital room late on Saturday as it seemed his death was near, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. It is not clear whether they connected or whether Robert's condition allowed him to speak by phone with the president.  Separately, several people who spoke to Trump on Saturday said he appeared saddened by the impending loss of his brother.  The younger Trump was previously hospitalised in June with an undisclosed serious condition. He served as an executive vice president of the Trump Organization. Part of his duties including overseeing the organisation's Atlantic City casinos.  Born in 1948, Robert was the youngest of the four siblings to the president, including the late Fred Trump, Jr.  In June, Robert filed a temporary restraining order in an attempt to block the publication of an unflattering tell-all book by Mary Trump, Fred Trump Jr.'s daughter, CNN reported.  Robert said in a statement to The New York Times at the time that he was ""deeply disappointed"" in Mary's decision to publish the book, which included details about the president's family, childhood and upbringing, the report said.  Trump once described his younger brother as ""much quieter and easygoing than I am,"" and ""the only guy in my life whom I ever call 'honey'"".  Robert began his career on Wall Street working in corporate finance but later joined the family business, managing real estate holdings as a top executive in the Trump Organization, the USA Today reported.  Before divorcing his first wife Blaine Trump more than a decade ago, Robert Trump had been active on Manhattan's Upper East Side charity circuit.  He avoided the limelight during his elder brother's presidency, having retired to the Hudson Valley. But he described himself as a big supporter of the White House run in a 2016 interview with the New York Post.  ""I support Donald one thousand per cent,"" Robert had said.  In early March of 2020, he married his longtime girlfriend, Ann Marie Pallan.  Former Vice President Joe Biden, who will challenge Donald Trump in the November 3 presidential election, offered condolences on Sunday to the president after his younger brother Robert Trump died.  ""Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert's passing,"" Biden said on Twitter. ""I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one - and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all."" Biden's running mate Kamala Harris and her husband, also expressed her condolences and ""prayers"" to the Trump family. ""Doug and I join the Biden family in sending our deepest condolences and prayers to the entire Trump family during this difficult time. Losing a loved one is never easy but know that we are thinking of you,"" Harris tweeted. "
"WASHINGTON: The US military has met its goal of reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan to about 2,500 by Friday, a drawdown that appears to violate a last-minute congressional prohibition. President Donald Trump, who ordered the reduction in November, said Thursday that troop levels in Afghanistan had reached a 19-year low, although he did not mention a troop number. Last February his administration struck a deal with the Taliban to reduce American troop levels in phases and to go to zero by May 2021, although it is unclear how the incoming Biden administration will proceed. President-elect Joe Biden, who has advocated keeping a small counterterrorism force in Afghanistan as a way to ensure that extremist groups like al-Qaida are unable to launch attacks on the United States, faces a number of questions on Afghanistan. One is how and whether to proceed with further troop cuts. Trump in his brief statement alluded to his longstanding desire to get out of Afghanistan entirely. âI will always be committed to stopping the endless wars,â he said, referring to US wars that have dragged on in Afghanistan since 2001 and in Iraq for much of the period since 2003. Although senior military officials had cautioned against speedy troop reductions in Afghanistan, acting defense secretary Christopher Miller announced on Nov. 17 that he was implementing Trump's order. As a result, military commanders scrambled to pull more than 1,500 troops out of the country in the last few weeks. At Trump's order, commanders also cut US troop levels in Iraq to 2,500 from about 3,000 in the same period. The Afghanistan decision was seen by some as unnecessarily complicating the decision-making of the incoming administration. Trump at the time had refused to acknowledge that he had lost the election and would be ceding to Biden on Jan. 20. Some in Congress, including fellow Republicans, opposed Trump's decision. Under the National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress two weeks ago, the Pentagon was explicitly forbidden to use money from this year's or last year's budget on reducing the number of troops below 4,000 â or below the number that was in the country the day the bill was finalized, which was January 1. Trump vetoed the measure, but both the House and Senate voted to override his veto. The Pentagon has not yet fully explained how it squares its continued drawdown with the legal prohibition. In response to questions about this, the Pentagon issued a written statement saying, âDoD will adhere to all statutory provisions of the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act, to include those in Section 1215 that impact the ongoing drawdown in Afghanistan.â It said it has been working with the National Security Council âon the most efficient means to ensure consistency amidst an anterior drawdown already occurring across Afghanistan, and in a manner that continues to ensure the safety of US personnel.â The defense legislation provides two conditions under which the Pentagon could get around the prohibition -- a presidential waiver or a report to Congress assessing the effect of a further drawdown on the US counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan and the risk to US troops there. As of Thursday the Pentagon had met neither of those conditions. The prohibition on completing the drawdown put the Pentagon in a bind, coming weeks after it had begun the drawdown, which involved a large logistical effort to remove equipment as well as troops. Because of less-than-transparent military procedures for counting troops in Afghanistan, it is possible that the 2,500 figure may be fudged. The main reason for concern about a too-quick troop withdrawal is what the Pentagon sees as continued high levels of Taliban violence against the Afghan government. Some US officials have questioned he wisdom of fully withdrawing, in accordance with the February 2020 agreement with the Taliban, if violence remains high. The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 was aimed at overthrowing the Taliban regime, running al-Qaida out of the country and laying the groundwork for a global âwar on terrorism.â It turned into something more ambitious but less well-defined and became far more costly in blood and treasure. During Biden's time as vice president, the US pushed US troop totals in Afghanistan to 100,000 in a failed bid to compel the Taliban to come to the negotiating table. When Trump took office four years ago there were about 8,500 troops in the country, and he raised it to about 13,000 that summer. Last month, when he met with Afghan officials in Kabul and with Taliban representatives in Qatar, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he emphasized to both sides that in order to give fledgling peace talks a chance, they must rapidly reduce levels of violence. âEverything else hinges on that,â Milley told reporters. During Milley's visit, Army Gen. Scott Miller, the top commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, told reporters that the Taliban had stepped up attacks on Afghan forces, particularly in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, and against roadways and other infrastructure.

"NEW YORK: President Donald Trump's impeachment trial could begin on Inauguration Day, just as Democrat Joe Biden takes the oath of office in an ever-moreextraordinary end to the defeated presidentâs tenure in the White House. The timing is not set and depends heavily on when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decides to transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate. Democrats hoping to avoid interrupting Bidenâs inauguration have suggested holding back until the new president has a chance to get his administration going. What is clear is that the trial will be unlike any other in the nationâs history, the first for a president no longer in office. And, politically, it will force a reckoning among some Republicans who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election. "
"WASHINGTON: With less than 144 hours to go before he exits the White House, Donald Trump is being called a ""flight risk"" amid White House disarray, Republican Party dissidence, aides' desertion, and family members decamping. Talk of Trump fleeing the country if he is convicted in a Senate trial and faces criminal prosecution after he leaves office was triggered off by reports in both the conservative media (Washington Times) and liberal press (Politico) which cited experts discussing his prospective destination countries and whether the US has extradition treaties with them. âHeâs got money. Heâs got property. Heâs got access. The government would argue that heâs a flight risk,"" an international extradition expert told the Times, which named UAE, Ireland, and Scotland, where he has assets, as his potential destinations. âHeâs not going back to New York and he is not going to enjoy the comfort at Mar-a-Lago he would have in the pre-Capitol-ransacking world. Iâll bet the feasibility of fleeing has come up because, in my mind, it is the only way to avoid instant accountability and reckoning,"" a former intelligence officer told the paper. The tattle about tee-ing off abroad came even as several Trump associates began deserting him and making critical remarks after four years of unquestioning loyalty. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf are among those who dumped on the departing President as the lights started going out at the Trump White House. Deprived of his personal Twitter account and disdained by banks, financial institutions, big tech and big business, Trump is reported to be ""isolated and angry,"" raging in a near empty White House. According to one account, he has instructed his aides not to pay his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani his $20,000 a day legal fees after the latter failed to make the case for the election being stolen from Trump. The Trump family, including his daughters Ivanka and Tiffany, and his sons Eric and Don Jr, are all packing up from not just Washington DC, but also New York City where they grew up, and heading down to Florida, where the President has now established residency. The defeated President is being taunted and trashed as he departs, with his critics taking it out on him after suffering four years of his bragging and bluster. ""Barack Obama has a Grammy, an Emmy, a Nobel Prize, 2 terms as President and a Twitter account. Donald Trump has 2 impeachments,"" read one social media post on Thursday. Politically, the Republican Party is splintering into factions still loyal to Trump, opposed to Trump, and those who are treading a delicate middle ground concerned about their political fortunes given the following the soon to be ex-president still commands in the base. "
"WASHINGTON: Lost popular vote twice. Impeached twice. That will be part of the disastrous legacy of the 45th US President Donald Trump after the House of Representatives indicted him on charges of âinciting violence against the government of the United Statesâ in a 232-197 vote in the midst of a worsening pandemic. Ten Republican lawmakers joined Democrats in impeaching the defeated President on Wednesday, pointing to a growing rift in the Grand Old Party, and ensuring that the indictment is, technically at least, a bipartisan outcome. Trump's first impeachment was not supported by a single Republican. The matter will now move to the US Senate for a trial that could result in a conviction with the support of 2/3rd of its members present and voting, followed by debarment from office (which requires only a simple majority). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican Trump ally-turned-critic, has said the trial would only begin before January 19, implicitly ensuring full proceedings will unfold after Democrats take charge with the swearing-in of President-elect Joe Biden, vice-president Kamala Harris, and newly -elected Senators. Harris will be the constitutionally mandated presiding officer of the Senate, with a tie-breaker vote that will give Democrats a majority voice in a chamber tied at 50-50. Biden has tried to stay above the fray, concerned that a prolonged impeachment trial will distract from his agenda, top of which is bringing the Covid-19 pandemic under control and applying economic salve. âI hope that the Senate leadership will find a way to deal with their constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation,â he said in a statement shortly after the House vote. But hardline Democrats angered by Trump's efforts to subvert election results and inciting an attack on the US Capitol want to go the whole hog and convict the President, with help from some establishment Republicans who want to put an outlier Trump out of the 2024 Presidential race. âHe must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, even as Trump supporters raged that the swift impeachment, which took less than a week (compared to weeks or even months earlier indictments took), would only âfurther fan the flames of partisan division.â In a debate laced with anger and anguish, lawmakers tore into each other with charges of subversion, betrayal, and treason, exposing deep rifts in the world's premier democracy, on a day the coronavirus pandemic claimed nearly 4400 lives, the highest one-day fatalities. The US is on track to reach a toll of 400,000 by the time Trump leaves the White House. Pro-Trump Republicans argued that the Senate cannot hold an impeachment trial after he has left office, with Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump-surrogate arguing that it could set a dangerous precedent for conviction of other former presidents going back to George Washington. Trump, meanwhile, ignored the House impeachment, and banned from a personal account on his favored social media platform, issued a video-taped statement from the White House, ""unequivocally"" denouncing violence and saying he was shocked by the ""calamity"" at the Capitol. It was a totally different tone from the one he used in the hours before when he encouraged his MAGA followers to march to the Capitol, telling them ""you'll never take back our country with weakness. ...you have to show strength, and you have to be strong."" A majority of US lawmakers read that as incitement to violence. On Wednesday, Trump claimed that ""Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,"" and ""no true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence, no true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag"" and ""no true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans."" ""If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it, and you are attacking our country,"" he added. "
"WASHINGTON: Some US lawmakers have said President Donald Trump should be disqualified from holding political office again following his impeachment on Wednesday for inciting a mob that stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Now that the House has impeached Trump, the Senate will hold a trial on whether to remove him and possibly bar him from future office. Legal experts said disqualification could be accomplished through the impeachment proceedings or the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. Here is how the disqualification effort could play out. Can Trump's disqualification be accomplished through impeachment?The US Constitution says there are two ways to punish an impeached official: removal from office or âdisqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."" The House approved a single article of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting insurrection when he delivered an incendiary speech to supporters shortly before the pro-Trump mob rampaged the Capitol. Trump is likely to argue at trial that his remarks were free speech protected by the Constitution's First Amendment and that, while he told supporters to ""fight,"" he did not intend it as a literal call to violence. Removing an official requires a ""conviction"" by a two-thirds Senate majority under the Constitution. Under precedent, only a simple majority is needed for disqualification. Historically, that vote only happens after a conviction. Three federal officials in US history have been disqualified through impeachment proceedings. All three were federal judges. Most recently, in 2010 the Senate removed and disqualified from future office a Louisiana judge found to have engaged in corruption. There is some debate over the scope of the disqualification clause and whether it applies to the presidency, said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. Analyzing historical documents, some law experts say the founders did not intend the presidency to be considered an ""office"" under the disqualification clause, while others argue that the term applies. Trump considering lawyer who spoke at rally for impeachment defence: SourcesCan Trump be disqualified if he is not convicted by the Senate?This is uncharted legal territory, and there is no clear answer, scholars said. Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado, said he believed a vote to disqualify Trump can be held even if there are not enough votes for conviction. The US Supreme Court has made clear that the Senate has wide latitude to determine how it conducts a trial, he said. But Kalt said he thought disqualification would require conviction first. To do otherwise would be the equivalent of punishing the president for an offense he did not commit, Kalt said. All three judges who were disqualified from office were first convicted. US security forces probe threats, ramp up to prevent repeat of Capitol mayhemWhat about the 14th Amendment?Section 3 of the 14th Amendment provides an alternative path for disqualification. The provision states that no person shall hold office if they have engaged in ""insurrection or rebellion"" against the United States. It was enacted following the Civil War to bar Confederates from holding public office. Under congressional precedent, only a simple majority of both chambers is needed to invoke this penalty. Congress can later remove the disqualification, but only if two-thirds of both houses vote in favor of doing so. In 1919, Congress used the 14th Amendment to block an elected official, Victor Berger, from assuming his seat in the House because he had actively opposed US intervention in World War I. Donald Trump urges Americans to be 'united' but doesn't mention impeachmentThe text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not explain how it should be invoked. Another section the 14th Amendment, Section 5, empowers Congress to enforce the entire amendment through ""appropriate legislation.â Some scholars have interpreted this language to mean that a majority of both chambers of Congress could enact a law applying a ban to a particular president, like Trump. ""The 14th Amendment route is very unclear as to what it would take to get it rolling,"" said Kalt. ""I think it would require some combination of legislation and litigation."" US Capitol Hill siege explained: How it happened and who were involvedCould Trump challenge a disqualification in court?It is certainly possible, said Kalt. A Supreme Court case from 1993 makes clear that the court is wary of second-guessing how the Senate handles impeachment. In that case, involving an accused judge, the court said whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be litigated. If Trump is disqualified, the current Supreme Court might want to clarify whether the move was lawful, Kalt said. Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court's nine members: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and most recently Amy Coney Barrett. The court now has a six-judge conservative majority. ""If you are going to say someone can't run, you want to get that litigated and settled sooner rather than later,"" Kalt said. "
"SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter Inc chief ecxecutive Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday that banning President Donald Trump from its social media platform after last week's violence at the US Capitol was the ""right decision,"" but said it sets a dangerous precedent. San Francisco-based Twitter last week removed Trump's account, which had 88 million followers, citing the risk of further violence following the storming of the Capitol by supporters of the president. ""Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation,"" Dorsey said on Twitter. ""They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation."" The ban drew criticism from some Republicans who said it quelled the president's right to free speech. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also warned through a spokesman that legislators, not private companies, should decide on potential curbs to free expression. In his Twitter thread, Dorsey said that while he took no pride in the ban, ""Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all."" Even so, he added, ""While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation."" Twitter has introduced a series of measures over the last year like labels, warnings and distribution restrictions to reduce the need for decisions about removing content entirely from the service. Dorsey has said he believes those measures can promote more fruitful, or ""healthy,"" conversations online and lessen the impact of bad behavior. The Twitter CEO added that bans by social media companies on Trump after last week's violence were emboldened by each other's actions even though they were not coordinated. But in the long term, the precedent set ""will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet,"" he said. Supporters of Trump who has repeatedly made baseless claims challenging Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election, stormed the USCapitol on Wednesday, trying to halt the certification by Congress of Biden's Electoral College win. On Wednesday, Trump became the first president in US history to be impeached twice. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has been impeached by the House days before leaving office, becoming the first American president to be impeached twice. The previous three impeachments - those of Presidents Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Trump - took months before a final vote, including investigations in the House and hearings. This time it only took a week after Trump encouraged a crowd of his supporters who attacked the US Capitol. Democrats and 10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump on one charge: incitement of insurrection. House, with some GOP support, impeaches Donald Trump for âincitement of insurrectionâOutgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate will not begin a trial until next Tuesday, at the very earliest, which is the day before Democrat Joe Biden is sworn in as president. It's unclear, for now, exactly how that trial will proceed and if any Senate Republicans will vote to convict Trump. Even though the trial won't happen until Trump is already out of office, it could still have the effect of preventing him from running for president again. A look at next steps: Sending to the SenateOnce the House votes to impeach, the speaker of the House can send the article or articles over to the Senate immediately or she can wait a while. Speaker Nancy Pelosi hasn't yet said when she will send them, but many Democrats in her caucus have urged her to do so immediately. Pelosi has already appointed nine impeachment managers to argue the case against Trump in a Senate trial, a sign that she will send them sooner rather than later. Once the articles are sent over that is usually done with an official walk from the House to the Senate - then the majority leader of the Senate must start the process of having a trial. The Senate scheduleThe Senate is not scheduled to be in session until Jan. 19, which could be McConnell's last day as Senate leader. Once Vice President Kamala Harris is sworn in, making her the president of the Senate, and Georgia's two Democratic senators are also sworn in, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer will take charge and determine how the trial will proceed. McConnell said he will not bring the Senate back on an emergency basis to start the trial, so the earliest it could begin would be Tuesday. That means the trial is certain to take place after Trump has already left office. McConnell noted that the three previous Senate trials lasted ""83 days, 37 days, and 21 days respectively."" All eyes on McConnellMcConnell believes that Trump committed impeachable offenses and considers the Democrats' impeachment drive an opportunity to reduce the divisive, chaotic president's hold on the GOP, a Republican strategist told The Associated Press on Wednesday. And McConnell told major donors over the weekend that he was through with Trump, said the strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe McConnell's conversations. His wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, resigned from Trump's Cabinet soon after the riots. But despite sending signals, McConnell has been characteristically quiet in public. In a note to colleagues Wednesday released by his office, McConnell said he had ""not made a final decision on how I will vote."" 1/12US House impeaches Trump for a second time; 10 Republicans vote yes Previous NextShow CaptionsImpeachment Article Engrossment ceremony against U.S. President Donald Trump at the US Capitol in Washington.

(Reuters)Senate politicsIf McConnell voted to convict, other Republicans would surely follow. But no GOP senators have said how they will vote, and two-thirds of the Senate is needed. Still, some Republicans have told Trump to resign, including Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, and few are defending him. Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has said he would take a look at what the House approves, but stopped short of committing to support it. Other Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, long a key ally of the president, has been critical of his behavior in inciting the riots but said impeachment ""will do far more harm than good."" Utah Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican to vote to convict Trump in last year's impeachment trial, after the House impeached Trump over his dealings with the president of Ukraine. In the House, 10 Republicans joined Democrats in voting to impeach Trump, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking Republican. Every single House Republican voted against Trump's first impeachment in 2019. Trump's futureIf the Senate were to convict, lawmakers could then take a separate vote on whether to disqualify Trump from holding future office. Schumer said Wednesday: ""Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again."" In the case of federal judges who were impeached and removed from office, the Senate has taken a second vote after conviction to determine whether to bar the person from ever holding federal office again. Only a majority of senators would be needed to ban him from future office, unlike the two-thirds needed to convict. Different charges, different impeachmentThis impeachment trial is likely to differ from the last one in many ways. The House charges in 2019 on Trump's dealings with the president of Ukraine, whom he urged to investigate Biden, came after a lengthy investigation and testimony from multiple government officials. While Democrats unanimously criticized the conduct and charged Trump with abuse of power, the charges wove together a complicated web of evidence. This time, Democrats felt there was little need for an investigation - the invasion of the Capitol played out on live television, and most members of Congress were in the building as it happened. Trump's speech beforehand, in which he told his supporters to ""fight like hell"" against the election results, was also televised as Congress prepared to officially count the votes. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, who led the last House impeachment team, said the insurrection at the Capitol was an ""impeachable offense committed in broad daylight, in which the whole country was a witness."" He said the lightning-fast impeachment ""was required by the exigency of the circumstances, and also made possible by the very nature of the crime."" The ArticleThe four-page article of impeachment says that Trump ""gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government."" It was introduced by Democratic Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Ted Lieu of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, all of whom have been tapped to serve as impeachment managers in the Senate trial. The article says Trump's behavior is consistent with his prior efforts to ""subvert and obstruct"" the results of the election and references his recent call with the Georgia secretary of state, in which he said he wanted him to find him more votes after losing the state to Biden. Trump has falsely claimed there was widespread fraud in the election, and the baseless claims have been repeatedly echoed by congressional Republicans and the insurgents who descended on the Capitol. As the protesters broke in, both chambers were debating GOP challenges to the electoral vote count in Arizona as part of the process for certifying Biden's election win. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump urged Americans to be ""united"" and avoid violence in his first comments after being impeached Wednesday -- while avoiding any mention of impeachment at all. In the videotaped speech, Trump said he was ""calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families."" Repudiating his supporters who assaulted Congress a week ago, triggering his second impeachment in the House of Representatives, Trump said ""there is never a justification for violence. No excuses, no exceptions: America is a nation of laws."" ""Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice,"" he said. "
"The Democrat-controlled US House of Representatives on Wednesday opened debate on a historic second impeachment of President Donald Trump over his supporters' attack of the Capitol that left five dead. Lawmakers in the lower chamber are expected to vote for impeachment around 3:00 pm (2000 GMT) -- marking the formal opening of proceedings against Trump. Republicans offered only modest reproach when President Donald Trump said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides of a white supremacist rally. They stayed in line when Trump was caught pressuring a foreign leader and later defended his handling of a deadly pandemic. But with a sudden force, the wall of Republican support that has enabled Trump to weather a seemingly endless series of crises is beginning to erode. Trump's weakened standing among his own party will come into sharper focus on Wednesday when the House is expected to impeach the president for inciting a riot at the US Capitol last week. A handful of Republicans have already said they'll join the effort, a number that could grow as the vote nears. The choice facing Republicans isn't just about the immediate fate of Trump, who has just seven days left in his presidency. It's about whether the party's elected leaders are ready to move on from Trump, who remains popular with many GOP voters but is now toxic in much of Washington. How they proceed could determine whether the party remains viable in upcoming elections or splinters in a way that could limit their relevance. ""We're at the moment now where we're seeing a fracturing, a breaking, because of the unprecedented situation - the sedition, the violence, the death,"" said Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategist who left the party because of Trump. The stunning nature of the deadly insurrection _ and Trump's role in fueling it - has shaken many lawmakers. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, gave rank-and-file conservatives the green light to abandon Trump in a scathing statement Tuesday evening. ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" she charged. More ominously for Trump, The New York Times reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell thinks Trump committed an impeachable offense and is glad Democrats are moving against him. Citing unidentified people familiar with the influential Kentucky Republican's thinking, the Times reported McConnell believes moving against Trump will help the GOP forge a future independent of the divisive, chaotic president. While stunning, the fast-moving developments do not ensure Trump will be forced from office before Democrat Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration. The timing of a Senate trial is unclear and could spill into Biden's presidency. But for the first time, there are real signs that a significant faction of Republicans want to purge Trump from their party. Already, three Trump Cabinet members have resigned in protest. Former Attorney General Bill Barr, who left the White House less than a month ago, accused his former boss of a ""betrayal of his office."" It took almost a week for Vice President Mike Pence, whose relationship with Trump has soured considerably since he and his family were forced into hiding during the Capitol siege, to publicly declare he would not to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Despite the defections, Trump remains popular with a significant portion of his political base. The president's remaining allies warn that Republicans who cross him publicly risk a conservative backlash in their next elections. ""Public and private polling shows Republican grassroots voters strongly oppose impeachment,"" said Jason Miller, a Trump senior adviser. ""Any Republican senator or congressman voting for impeachment will be held accountable in their next primary election."" Trump emerged from his White House fortress for the first time since the riots for a trip to the wall his administration built along the Texas border. As he left Washington, he was careful to insist ""we want no violence,"" but denied any responsibility for the insurrection. Once he reached the border, his remarks to a small crowd were fairly muted. In the end, he spoke for just 21 minutes and spent less than 45 minutes on the ground in what was expected to be the final trip of his presidency. Before leaving, he offered an ominous warning to Democrats leading the charge to remove him from office: ""Be careful what you wish for."" That veiled threat came as the nation - and members of Congress - braced for the potential of more violence ahead of Biden's inauguration. The FBI warned this week of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington. Capitol security officials made the extraordinary decision to require members of Congress to pass through metal detectors to enter the House chamber beginning on Tuesday, although some Republicans resisted the new rule. It's unclear whether the chaos in Washington represents an existential threat to the party, but it almost certainly threatens to undermine the GOP's short-term political goals. Several major corporations, many of them reliably Republican donors, have promised to stop sending political donations to any of the 147 Republicans who perpetuated Trump's false claims of election fraud by voting to reject Biden's victory last week. The fundraising challenge comes at a bad time for the GOP. History suggests that the Republican Party, as the minority party in Washington, should regain control of the House or Senate in 2022. At the same time, a collection of ambitious Republicans are trying to position themselves to run for the White House in 2024. They are also contending with Trump's legacy. One of them, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, reminded reporters on Tuesday that he's condemned the Trump presidency from the very beginning. ""I've been in the same place I've been for the whole four years. A lot of people have just changed their position,"" Hogan said, while vowing not to leave the GOP. ""I don't want to leave the party and let these people who did a hostile takeover four years ago take over."" Despite Hogan's confidence, he is far less popular among Trump's loyal base _ a group likely to hold great sway in the selection of the party's next presidential nominee - than the likes of Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, two other 2024 prospects who voted to reject Biden's victory last week, even after the uprising. ""Republican leaders do not know how to move forward,"" Republican pollster Frank Luntz said. ""Everybody's afraid that Donald Trump will tell people to come after them, but they also realize they're losing the center of America. They're trapped."" "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's youngest son Barron had Covid-19 with no symptoms and has now tested negative, First Lady Melania Trump said in a family health update. ""It was two weeks ago when I received the diagnosis that so many Americans across our country and the world had already received - I tested positive for Covid-19. To make matters worse, my husband, and our nation's Commander-in-Chief, received the same news,"" Xinhua news agency quoted the First Lady as saying on Wednesday. ""Naturally my mind went immediately to our son. To our great relief he tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn't help but think 'what about tomorrow or the next day?' My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms."" ""He has since tested negative,"" she said of her 14-year-old son. Melania Trump said she experienced a ""roller coaster of symptoms"", praising the medical care the first family received. ""I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time. I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food,"" she said. Stephanie Grisham, the First Lady's Chief of Staff and spokeswoman, told USA TODAY on October 2 that Barron ""has tested negative, and all precautions are being taken to ensure he's kept safe and healthy"". That same day, the President had announced that he and the First Lady had tested positive for Covid-19. Before and after their infection, a number of White House staff also tested positive for the virus. According to a government memo released last week, at least ""34 White House staffers and other contacts"" were infected with the disease. Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller, both senior aides to the President, had tested positive in recent days. The others in the President's inner circle who have also tested positive for the virus are White House Press Secretary Kayley McEnany, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, Utah Senator Mike Lee, North Carolina Senator Thom Tilis, former adviser Kellyanne Conway and Trump campaign director Bill Stepien.

"WASHINGTON: Google-owned YouTube on Tuesday temporarily suspended President Donald Trump's channel and removed a video for violating its policy against inciting violence. ""In light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to Donald J. Trump's channel for violating our policies,"" YouTube said in a statement. The channel is now ""temporarily prevented from uploading new content for a 'minimum' of 7 days,"" the statement read. Facebook last week suspended Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts following the violent invasion of the US Capitol by a mob of his supporters, which temporarily disrupted the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's election victory. Twitter went a step further by deleting Trump's account, depriving him of his favorite platform. Trump also was hit with suspensions by services like Snapchat and Twitch. "
"WASHINGTON: Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief Chris Krebs was fired by Donald Trump for contradicting the US president's claims of voter fraud. Trump said he ""terminated"" Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief Chris Krebs for his ""highly inaccurate"" remarks on vote integrity, the BBC reported. Trump has refused to concede the US election, and has made unsubstantiated claims of ""massive"" voter fraud. Election officials said the vote was the ""most secure"" in US history. Krebs is the latest official to be dismissed by the US president following his defeat, with Defence Secretary Mark Esper also shown the door amid reports Trump doubted the Pentagon chief's loyalty. There is speculation in Washington DC that before Trump leaves office in January, CIA director Gina Haspel and FBI director Christopher Wray could also be for the chopping block. Like many others fired by Trump, Krebs reportedly only learned he was out of a job when he saw the president's tweet on Tuesday. But following his dismissal, the former Microsoft executive appeared to have no regrets. He had run the agency from its inception two years ago in the aftermath of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. To guard against potential cyber-threats, Cisa works with state and local election officials and the private companies that supply voting systems, while monitoring ballot tabulation and the power grid. He had reportedly incurred the White House's displeasure over a Cisa website called Rumor Control, which debunked election misinformation, much of it amplified by the president himself. Hours before he was fired, he posted a tweet that appeared to take aim at Trump's allegation that voting machines in various states had switched ballots to Biden. Krebs tweeted: ""ICYMI: On allegations that election systems were manipulated, 59 election security experts all agree, 'in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.' #Protect2020"". This post, and others by Krebs dating back to the end of July this year, appear to have been deleted from his Twitter account. He was among senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security who last week declared the November 3 US general election the ""most secure in American history"", while rejecting ""unfounded claims"". Though that statement did not name Trump, on the same day it was published Krebs retweeted a Twitter post by an election law expert saying: ""Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're made by the president."" Krebs dismissal brought outrage from Democrats. A spokesman for President-elect Joe Biden said ""Chris Krebs should be commended for his service in protecting our elections, not fired for telling the truth"" "
"NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee on information technology on Tuesday unanimously decided to summon Twitter and Facebook to explain their actions in recent days to ban accounts and institute sudden changes in privacy policies -- a move that comes in the backdrop of US President Donald Trump being banned on Twitter. The decision on Trump has given rise to the question of whether private enterprises doing public service could unilaterally exercise the power to remove people from platforms. Sources said panel members also agree unanimously that while Twitter has repeatedly referred to itself as a data intermediary, it has acted in this instance as both publisher and censor, and must, as a result explain its actions, since they have consequences not just for the US, but for India and the rest of the world. Similar questions will also be posed to Facebook (and WhatsApp), which the committee decided to summon over the recent changes in privacy policy, and which has led to large-scale exodus from the platform in India. Summons to the two social media giants are expected to be sent out soon and the date of the panelâs meeting will be fixed accordingly. On Tuesday, the panel also discussed the functioning of the Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI), where representatives of UIDAI spoke about the extent of Aadhaar coverage in India. They also negated specific questions about data breaches, maintaining that safety protocols at UIDAI were robust, and breaches, if any, had only happened at the level of external agencies. Officials also told the panel the Aadhaar enrolment remains voluntary. On Wednesday, the panel will examine the functioning of the Central Board of Film Certification, commonly referred to as the censor board. "
"NEW DELHI: In a major jolt to the Narendra Modi government, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the execution of the three contentious agri laws of the centre which are being protested tooth and nail by the farmers since November 26 last year. The top court also constituted a four-member committee to hear the grudges of the farmers and recommend points to solve the vexed issue. Here are the key developments of the day: 1. The Supreme Court stayed the implementation of new farm laws till further orders saying it may encourage the protesting farmers to come to the negotiating table in good faith. The stay may âassuage the hurt feelingsâ of farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence, a bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said. It also observed that the apex court cannot be said to be âcompletely powerlessâ to grant stay of any executive action under a statutory enactment. The top court, noting that negotiations between the farmers' unions and the government have ânot yielded any result so farâ, said the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of farmers. 2. The implementation of the three farm laws (1) Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; (2) Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020; and (3) Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, shall stand stayed until further orders, the top court said and posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks. 3. As a consequence, the Supreme Court said, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system in existence before the enactment of the farm laws shall be maintained until further orders. âIn addition, the farmers' land holdings shall be protected - no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws,â the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said in its 11-page interim order. The bench said it thinks that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmer bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others. 4. The four-member committee comprises Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana. 5. However, the government told the Supreme Court that there are âinherent safeguardsâ in the new agri laws for protection of land of farmers, who have been âmisledâ that their lands will be taken away. The government told the bench that it will be ensured that no farmer will lose his land. âMisapprehensions have been made that your (farmers) land will go and it will be taken away. That is how the farmers have been misled,â solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench. The government said the order to stay the implementation of three new farm laws is against its wish but the direction of the apex court is 'sarva-manya' (acceptable to all) and welcomed the composition of an ""impartial"" committee to resolve the deadlock. Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary made these remarks and also said he is confident that whatever decision is taken by the court, that will be ""taken to ensure that the laws are kept the way they are"". 6. The farmersâ leaders said they welcome the Supreme Court order staying the implementation of the three farm laws till further orders, but they will continue to protest till the contentious legislations are repealed and expressed doubts over the neutrality of the panel formed by the top court to end the impasse. The agitating farmers also made it clear that they will not participate in the SC-ordered committee process. In a statement, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said, ""It is clear that the court is being misguided by various forces even in its constitution of a committee. These are people who are known for their support to the three Acts and have actively advocated for the same."" 7. While opposition parties like NCP and DMK welcomed the SC order and hoped that it will help in resolving the deadlock, the Congress leaders expressed apprehensions over the members chosen for the committee, saying they are known for their support to the three Acts and the agitating farmers. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also raised questions over the formation of the committee, asking can justice be expected from people who have given written support to the ""anti-agriculture laws"". ""This struggle will continue till anti-farmer-worker laws are repealed. Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan,"" he tweeted. Addressing a press conference, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the party welcomes the Supreme Court's concern over the farm laws, but the party has issues with the composition of the committee formed by it. He said the members of the committee have already expressed their views in the past favouring the new laws ""so the question arises in our minds that how justice will be done to farmers by their hands"". 8. Asserting that any order of the Supreme Court has to be complied with by all the concerned parties, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli attacked the Congress for its criticism of the court-appointed committee. The Congress' stand and conduct on the agricultural laws is a ""classic testimony towards its duplicity and opportunistic politics practised since 2005"". The BJP has said the Congress-led UPA government had supported farm reforms but the opposition party has now taken a U-turn due to political reasons. 9. The Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said it fully supports the farmers' demand for a repeal of three new farm laws, saying the formation of a committee by the Supreme Court is not a ""permanent solution"" to the issue. The party does not want any ""compromise"" with the self-respect of farmers, state AAP chief Bhagwant Mann said, adding that the only way to end the deadlock is to repeal the ""black"" laws. In a statement, Mann claimed that most of the members of the Supreme Court-appointed committee are representatives of the BJP-led centre. ""We doubt that this committee will be able to understand the real problems of the farmers and solve those permanently. This fight of the farmers is not for forming any committee,"" he said. The AAP MP said the only demand of the protesting farmers is to repeal the three laws. 10. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the farmers protesting at Delhi's borders should end their agitation now following the formation of a committee by the Supreme Court over the new farm laws. âThe ball is now in the court of the SC and I feel whatever is its decision, it will be acceptable to all,â he said, welcoming the SC order. On the farmer unions' refusal to call off their protest after the SC order, Khattar said there was no reason now for them to continue with it. He said the farmers should lift their âdharna' at Delhi's border and head back to the places they had come from. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump, under pressure to resign after his supporters carried out a deadly breach of the US Capitol last week, said there was tremendous anger about moves to impeach him but added he did not want violence. ""I want no violence,"" Trump told reporters as he left for a trip to the border wall in Alamo, Texas. In his first remarks to reporters since December 8, the embattled Republican president did not answer a question about whether he would resign. He criticised impeachment moves by Democratic lawmakers. ""This impeachment is causing tremendous anger and they're doing it, and it's really a terrible thing that they're doing,"" Trump said. He added that the move to impeach him, on a charge of inciting insurrection over the Capitol attack, was a continuation of the ""witch hunt"" against him. On being asked whether he bears any responsibility for storming of US Capitol, Trump said his words at the time were 'totally appropriate'. Trump would become the first US president to be impeached twice if the House of Representatives votes in favor of impeachment on Wednesday. "
"WASHINGTON: Banks, corporations, and business leaders are joining Big Tech and social media in cutting ties with Donald Trump and extremist Republicans in the final days of his Presidency as he winds down four turbulent years in the White House as the disgraced leader of a discredited ""MAGA"" movement. An increasingly isolated Trump headed out Alamo, Texas on Tuesday to celebrate 400 miles of border wall completed in his four years in office even as the walls closed on him on the social, political, and business front for his role in inciting violence. But a defiant Trump maintained that his speech which is credited with igniting passions was ""totally appropriate"" and the move to impeach him for insurrection is causing ""tremendous anger."" ""For (Democrat leaders) Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to continue on this path, I think it's causing tremendous danger to our country, and it's causing tremendous anger. I want no violence,"" Trump warned, even as the FBI and law enforcement authorities geared up for a possible second round of attacks on the US Capitol by white supremacists and MAGA extremists. As the Democrat-majority US House of Representatives gathered to vote on a resolution asking Vice President Mike Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to boot Trump out of the White House even though only about 200 hours remain of his Presidency, Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank, his biggest lenders, cut ties with him for his alleged role in fomenting MAGA violence. Morgan Stanley, AT&T, Marriott, and Dow among others said they would stop political donations to members of Congress who voted against certification of election results, while some others, notably Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, and FedEx said they are freezing contributions to both parties pending review of the events that transpired last week when a Trump-incited MAGA mob stormed the US Capitol. Trump himself was reported to have blamed ""Antifa people"" for the violence in a phone call with Republican leader Kevin McCarthy amid disarray within the GOP split between hardcore Trump supporters and moderates. Given the overwhelming evidence, which included Trump, his sons, and his minions urging the MAGA mob to march on the Capitol to ""fight like hell"" and ""take back America,"" even Republicans are finding it hard to defend the President. Several have indicated they may support his impeachment if he does not resign before January 20th. Trump met Pence for over an hour at the White House the first time after the storming of the Capitol where a bloodthirsty MAGA mob wanted to hang the vice-president for not supporting the defeated President's effort to steal the election. Amid signs that Pence would not support the Democrats demand for him to invoke the 25th amendment, despite slights from Trump, the White House said in a statement the two had a ""good conversation...reflecting on the last four years of the administrationâs work and accomplishments."" They also reiterated that those who broke the law and stormed the Capitol last week do not represent the America first movement backed by 75 million Americans, and pledged to continue the work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term,"" the White House said. Pence has said through aides that he intends to attend the Biden inauguration on January 20; Trump has declared he will not. There are also reports that Trump's daughter Ivanka may go against her father's wish and attend the swearing in. The FBI and local law enforcement meanwhile is on high alert against a possible return to Washington by MAGA extremists and white nationalists wanting to disrupt the inauguration. US agencies are warning of armed protests in all 50 states in the days leading up to the Biden inauguration, particularly if Trump is removed from office before that. It is hard to fathom what is happening on the ground or in MAGA minds and Trump country given the Covid-19 restrictions and social media clampdown against extremists. Some militia groups that called for a return to the capital on January 17 and after have not been heard from since, as authorities are rounding up suspected troublemakers. Twitter has culled more than 70,000 accounts associated with the far right QAnon conspiracy theory following US. Capitol riot and Amazon has shut down Parler and other right wing echo chambers. Scores of MAGA extremists who stormed the US Capitol portraying themselves as ""patriots"" have been arrested in aggressive if belated enforcement of law and order. Some are recanting on their belief and some are on the run. More than 15,000 National Guard and law enforcement personnel are being deployed to secure the US capital ahead of the Biden inauguration. "
"LONDON: Twitter says it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts associated with the far right QAnon conspiracy theory following last week's US Capitol riot. The social media company said Tuesday that given the events last week in Washington, DC, where a mob of pro-Trump loyalists tried to violently storm the Capitol building, it was taking action against online behaviour âthat has the potential to lead to offline harm."" In many cases, a single individual operated numerous accounts, driving up the total number of affected accounts, the company said in a blog post. âThese accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service,â the company said. Twitter's sweeping purge of QAnon accounts, which began Friday, is part of a wider crackdown that also includes its decision to ban President Donald Trump from the service over worries about further incitement to violence. The suspensions mean some Twitter users will lose followers, in some cases by the thousands, the company said. The QAnon conspiracy theory is centered on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against âdeep stateâ enemies and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals. Twitter has previously tried to crack down on QAnon, removing more than 7,000 accounts in July. Twitter said it's also stepping up enforcement measures and starting Tuesday it will limit the spread of posts that violate its civic integrity policy by preventing anyone from replying to, liking or retweeting them. The policy prohibits attempts to manipulate elections and spread misleading info about their results, with repeated violations resulting in permanent suspension. "
"SAN FRANCISCO: A planned protest outside Twitter's San Francisco headquarters against the social media platform's ban of Donald Trump fizzled out Monday when just a handful of the US president's supporters turned up. Messages posted this weekend on popular far-right forum TheDonald.win had called on pro-Trump activists to assemble outside the tech giant's offices, which are largely deserted as staff work from home due to the pandemic. One user even urged participants to bring zip ties to ""citizen arrest violent agitators,"" the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Police deployed dozens of officers and constructed security barriers, but only a few protesters and counter-protesters arrived. ""I don't like being censored. And I feel conservative voices are being censored,"" one protester told the local Fox television station KTVU. Kenneth Lundgreen, 71, told the Chronicle he wanted to ""act as a counter balance"" in case a crowd like the one that stormed the US Capitol in Washington, DC last week arrived. Shortly after that unrest, Twitter imposed a permanent ban on Trump's account -- which had 88 million subscribers -- prompted by multiple violations of its rules and the risk of ""further incitement of violence."" Trump accused the company of conspiring with the ""Radical Left,"" while some international leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel have called the ban ""problematic."" Other platforms including Facebook and Snapchat also have suspended Trump. US Democrats have launched the process of impeaching Trump for a historic second time for ""incitement of insurrection"" over the attack on the Capitol, in which five people died. "
"WASHINGTON: As much as President Donald Trump loves golf, leaders of the sport are racing away from the embattled US leader for what they say is the good of the game. The PGA of America stripped the 2022 PGA Championship from Trump National at Bedminster, New Jersey, on Sunday, days after Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol. PGA of America chief executive officer Seth Waugh says associating with Trump would be harmful for the organization's brand and its mission to grow and support the sport. ""It became clear to us that our brand was at stake,"" Waugh told The Golf Channel on Monday. ""We thought we were putting at risk that mission if we were to hold the tournament at Trump Bedminster."" The R&A, global golf's governing body, said Monday that Trump Turnberry, a past regular stop for the British Open, was not in current plans for the championship. ""We had no plans to stage any of our championships at Turnberry and will not do so in the foreseeable future,"" the R&A said in a statement. ""We will not return until we are convinced that the focus will be on the championship, the players and the course itself and we do not believe that is achievable in the current circumstances."" Trump Bedminster hosted the 2017 US Women's Open, the US Golf Association pressing ahead despite protesters outside the club. It was awarded the 2022 PGA in 2014 by the PGA of America, which called removing the event a business decision rather than a political one. ""Right now in the country almost anybody views any decision being made as political,"" PGA of America president Jim Richerson told Golf Channel. ""We tried to take politics out of it and just get back and focus on our brand and what's best for the game of golf. We all believe it was the right decision."" Trump's trademark love of golf includes ownership of at least 17 worldwide golf properties and hundreds of rounds played during his presidency. At the 2017 Presidents Cup, Trump became the first sitting President to award the trophy after a 19-11 US victory at Liberty National in New Jersey. Trump has played alongside such stars as Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, who gave lukewarm support after rounds. ""Well, he's the president of the United States. You have to respect the office,"" Woods said in 2018. ""You may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office."" Woods, a 15-time major winner, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump in 2019. McIlroy played alongside Trump in 2017 but said last year he doubted he would do it again. ""I probably wouldn't, no,"" McIlroy said last May. ""The day that I did spend with him and others was very enjoyable. He's very charismatic and was nice to everyone... That doesn't mean I agree with everything -- or, in fact, anything -- that he says."" Waugh wouldn't say if he thought Trump was good for golf. ""I know he has a passion for it and I know he has certainly done an awful lot of good,"" Waugh said. ""He owns some of the greatest properties on the planet and I know he has been a good steward for those properties. I know he has an abiding love for the game and I hope he continues to have a home in it."" Waugh also realizes that in a divided nation, Trump has his supporters even among the PGA of America membership. ""We're not naive about the fact there will be detractors,"" Waugh said. ""We hope they can understand we made this not as a political statement but as caretakers for our mission and our game."" Critics of the PGA of America move included PGA Tour player Grayson Murray. The 27-year-old American, ranked 563rd, won his only title at the 2017 Barbasol Championship. ""Hey @POTUS you should just host a tournament the same week as the 2022 PGA championship at your course,"" Murray tweeted. ""Put up a huge purse that players can't turn down. Make the pga championship a weak field or force them to up their purse and cost them more money."" Jack Nicklaus, an 18-time major champion, tweeted last October that he voted for Trump. ""I have seen a resolve and a determination to do the right thing for our country,"" he tweeted. ""His love for America and its citizens, and putting his country first, has come through loud and clear. Trump is a notorious golf cheat, according to Rick Reilly's 2019 book ""Commander in Cheat"", which detailed Trump's golf, noting some caddies nicknaming him ""Pele"" for kicking balls from the rough into the fairway. The PGA of America dropped the 2015 Grand Slam of Golf from Trump National in Los Angeles after Trump made remarks about Mexican immigrants and in 2016, four years after Trump bought Doral, the PGA Tour moved its WGC event to Mexico City after it had been played there since 1962.

"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's acting head of the Department of Homeland Security abruptly resigned Monday, leaving the post ahead of schedule as the nation faces a heightened terrorism threat from extremists seeking to reverse the election. The announcement by acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf was perplexing. It came less than a week after he pledged to remain in office and just 10 days before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. Wolf cited a legal challenge to his leadership as a reason for his resignation, but that had surfaced months ago. ``For months we have known Chad Wolf has been serving illegally in his position, so the timing of his resignation from the Department today is questionable,`` said Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ``He has chosen to resign during a time of national crisis and when domestic terrorists may be planning additional attacks on our government.'' Wolf, who had been serving in an acting capacity since November 2019 and was never confirmed by the Senate, said he was compelled to leave by ``recent events,'' including court rulings that found he could not legally hold the position. He did not specify the other events or cite other factors. ``These events and concerns increasingly serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power,'' he said in a written message to DHS employees. The resignation comes a day before Trump is set to visit the U.S.-Mexico border wall, Trump's signature political project and one overseen by DHS. Wolf's departure followed the abrupt resignation of other Cabinet officials angered by Trump's role in encouraging the mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 over his false claims of election fraud. Wolf condemned the violent attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, calling it ``tragic and sickening.'' He also said then he would stay on at DHS until the end of the administration to ensure a smooth transition and to help the department stay focused on the threats facing the nation. It was unclear what prompted him to change course with the nation braced for the potential for more violence ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration. The FBI has warned of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington, D.C The White House had no immediate comment. Wolf led DHS as it carried out Trump administration priorities on immigration and law enforcement, prompting criticism that he politicized a department that was created to better protect the nation in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The department was accused during his tenure by a whistleblower of suppressing facts in intelligence reports that Trump might find objectionable, including information about Russian interference in the election and the rising threat posed by white supremacists. Wolf and the department denied the allegations. The acting secretary defended his tenure in his statement to employees, saying DHS had strengthened border security and successfully launched the cybersecurity agency that helped safeguard the 2020 election. ``I leave knowing that the Department has positioned itself for an orderly and smooth transition to President-elect Biden's DHS team,'' he wrote. ``Welcome them, educate them, and learn from them. They are your leaders for the next four years _ a time which undoubtedly will be full of challenges and opportunities to show the American public the value of DHS and why it is worth the investment.`` Peter Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will serve as acting head of the Department of Homeland Security until the Biden administration takes over. ``Right now, our nation is facing significant challenges and it is our privilege to support the nationwide efforts to fight the pandemic and protect our homeland,'' Gaynor said in a message to FEMA employees. He announced that his post would be filled by Bob Fenton, the Region 9 administrator for the agency, on an acting basis. Biden has nominated Alejandro Mayorkas, a former senior DHS official, to lead an agency that carried out Trump administration priorities on immigration and law enforcement and was criticized for becoming politicized as a result. Trump appointed Wolf acting secretary in November 2019, following the resignation of Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary who took over following the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Wolf had been a chief of staff to Nielsen and an undersecretary in the agency as well as an official at the Transportation Security Administration, a component of DHS. He has also worked as a lobbyist. Trump had said he liked the ``flexibility'' of having senior officials in an acting status despite criticism that it keeps people from long-term planning that would give an agency more stability. The president sent Wolf's nomination to the Senate for confirmation after the Government Accountability Office determined that neither Wolf nor his deputy, Ken Cuccinelli, were legally eligible to run DHS because of a violation of the rules of succession in federal agencies. That finding has put policy changes under their tenure, especially related to immigration, in potential jeopardy because of legal challenges, including one as recently as Friday in which a federal judge blocked sweeping asylum restrictions imposed by the administration.

"The Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol building by a pro-Trump mob left a police officer and a rioter dead. More than 50 members of the US Capitol Police were injured, including 15 who required hospitalization, most of them with head wounds, according to Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. Of all the scenes of violence, one of the most intense occurred during a struggle to breach a west-side door, during which multiple rioters dragged police officers out of a formation and assaulted them while they were trapped in the crowd. There was widespread speculation on social media that one of the officers was Brian Sicknick â the U.S. Capitol Police officer who died after being hit in the head by a rioter wielding a fire extinguisher. But videos show the officers involved in this incident were members of the Metropolitan Police Department. Hereâs how the assault happened. Shortly after 2 p.m., the mob on the Capitolâs west side forced its way through the final, thinly defended police barricades and reached the buildingâs walls. Hundreds of rioters swarmed toward a west-side doorway thatâs traditionally used when presidents emerge for their inauguration ceremonies. They surged into the doorway, and an hourslong fight to breach the Capitol began. Not long after the start of the struggle, rioters were captured on video pulling a Metropolitan Police officer down the stairs. In a video, some rioters can be heard urging others not to hurt him. News photographers on the scene captured images of the officer caught in the crowd, which began chanting âpolice stand down!â The mob pulled the officer away, and rioters continued to try to force their way past the police defending the doorway. They climbed on top of each other to attack the officers with stolen Capitol Police shields, sticks and poles. During a brief lull, some rioters appeared to give up and retreat down the stairway. But a new group lunged toward the police and started a new attack. At the front of the mob, they exchanged blows with the police and struck officers with hockey sticks, crutches and flags. Some rioters shouted âPush! Push!â One of the attackers, a man wearing a white and blue hat and a green jacket, reached into the doorway, grabbed an officer and dragged him out, aided by a man in a gray hooded sweatshirt. As they pulled the officer down the stairs, face down, another rioter beat him with an American flag as the mob chanted âUSA! USA! USA!â Seconds later, two other men â one wearing a red hat and tactical vest bearing a âsheriffâ patch â began yanking the legs of another officer who had fallen to the ground. With the aid of a third man in a gray jacket, they pulled the officer down the steps as well. One rioter appeared to punch him while he was on the ground. One of the two dragged officers can be seen in another video standing up before being mobbed and punched. Some rioters called on others not to hurt him as the mob led him away. The Times sent an image to the Metropolitan Police Department of one of the officers whose helmet number is clearly visible on video. Dustin Sternbeck, a spokespeson for the department, said he did not want to try to identify the officer because many may have put on other officersâ helmets. Sternbeck said he hoped more officers would be able to share their stories with the public soon. âThey just feel beaten up,â Sternbeck said. At least three of the individuals who can be seen dragging the officers in the videos match images included on a Metropolitan Police list of âpersons of interest.â They are suspected of assaulting police officers and could face federal charges.

"WASHINGTON: The FBI has warned of armed protests being planned for Washington and all 50 US state capitals in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration, a federal law enforcement source said on Monday. Threatened with more violence from outgoing President Donald Trump's supporters following last Wednesday's storming of the US Capitol, the FBI issued warnings for next weekend that run at least until Inauguration Day, the source said. In other steps to safeguard the US capital, the National Guard was authorized to send up to 15,000 troops to Washington, and tourists were barred from visiting the Washington Monument until January 24. The chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, told reporters he expected about 10,000 troops in Washington by Saturday to help provide security, logistics and communications. He said the number could rise to 15,000 if requested by local authorities. At least one lawmaker asked the Pentagon to do more. Senator Chris Murphy, who said he was sending a letter to the acting secretary of defense on Monday, said it was unclear if the National Guard would be sufficient to protect the nation's capital and that active-duty troops may be needed also. ""I'm not afraid of taking the oath outside,"" Biden told reporters in Newark, Delaware, referring to the traditional setting for the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds. But he said it was critically important that people ""who engaged in sedition and threatened people's lives, defaced public property, caused great damage"" be held accountable. Biden's inaugural committee said on Monday the theme of the Jan. 20 ceremony would be ""America United."" Trump, who has sought unsuccessfully to overturn the November 3 election results with false claims of widespread fraud, said last week he would not attend the ceremony, a decision the president-elect supported. WASHINGTON MONUMENT CLOSED TO TOURSThe Park Service said it would suspend tours of the Washington Monument, an obelisk honoring the country's first president, due to safety concerns from threats to disrupt the inauguration. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called for the US Interior Department to cancel public-gathering permits through January 24. ""This inaugural planning period has to be very different than all the others,"" she told reporters on Monday. In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf made public on Sunday, Bowser called for a fresh approach to security after what she called last week's ""unprecedented terrorist attack."" Bowser asked Wolf to extend the National Special Security Event period from Monday through January 24. The Secret Service heads security operations for events, including presidential inaugurations, considered to be nationally significant. Wolf said in a statement he had instructed the Secret Service to begin National Special Security Event operations for the inauguration effective Wednesday, instead of January 19 as previously scheduled. The acting secretary told his staff he was stepping down on Monday. The assault on the Capitol, challenging the certification of Biden's election victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer. Dozens of people have been charged in the violence and hundreds of more cases are expected. The assault occurred shortly after Trump urged supporters to march on the Capitol during a rally where he repeated false claims his resounding defeat in November's election was illegitimate. Democrats in Congress began a push on Monday to force Trump from office, introducing an article of impeachment that accuses him of inciting insurrection. The presidential inaugural committee and Bowser have told Americans not to travel to the inauguration, and said Washington's National Mall would be covered with 191,500 flags of different sizes, to represent the missing crowds. A presidential inauguration traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to Washington, but the ceremonies have been scaled back dramatically because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In state capitols, governors are on high alert ahead of the inauguration. In Wisconsin, a swing state where Trump alleged election fraud, Governor Tony Evers authorized the Wisconsin National Guard to support the state's Capitol Police. In Michigan, another swing state where Biden's victory was contested by Trump, the state's Capitol Commission, which oversees the legislature, issued an order to ban the open carrying of weapons inside the Capitol building in Lansing.

"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is issuing an emergency declaration for the nations capital amid growing concern among local and federal authorities about violence in the lead-up to and during President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20. The declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate with local authorities as needed. The declaration from Trump comes five days after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as Congress began formally counting the Electoral College votes to certify his defeat to Biden. Five people died. Trump has spent months complaining that he was cheated out of an election victory by widespread voter fraud, which election officials say does not exist. Earlier Monday, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan urged people to stay away from inaugural events because of ""last weeks violent insurrection as well as the ongoing and deadly Covid-19 pandemic."" Trumps emergency declaration is in effect from Monday through January 24. "
"SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter Inc said it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts since Friday that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content after last week's violence in Washington when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol. ""Given the violent events in Washington, DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon"", Twitter said in a blog late on Monday. ""These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service"", the company said. QAnon backers have pushed conspiracies on social media that include the baseless claim that Trump secretly is fighting a cabal of child-sex predators, among them prominent Democrats, figures in Hollywood and ""deep state"" allies. Twitter had said on Friday it would permanently suspend accounts pushing QAnon content, banning prominent right-wing boosters of its conspiracy theories. The storming of the Capitol building last week by Trump supporters delayed the certification of Biden's election victory. Lawmakers were forced to flee, as the building was mobbed by the president's supporters who overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence including one Capitol Police officer who was beaten as he tried to ward off the crowds. "
"WASHINGTON: Congressional Democrats began a push on Monday to force US President Donald Trump from office, introducing one article of impeachment accusing him of inciting insurrection over a violent attack on the Capitol last week. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is expected to take up the matter as early as Wednesday. Passage would make Trump, a Republican, the only president in US history to be impeached twice. Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol last week, forcing lawmakers who were certifying Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's election victory into hiding in a harrowing assault on the heart of American democracy that left five dead. The violence came after Trump urged supporters to march on the Capitol at a rally where he repeated false claims that his resounding defeat in the November 3 election was illegitimate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, many of her fellow Democrats and a handful of Republicans say the Republican president should not be trusted to serve out his term, which ends on January 20. ""In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,"" Pelosi wrote to her fellow House Democrats on Sunday. Earlier, Republicans blocked an effort to immediately consider a resolution asking Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the U.S. Constitution's never-used 25th Amendment to remove an unfit president. The House is expected on Tuesday to vote on the resolution calling for use of the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and the Cabinet to remove a president who is incapable of fulfilling his duties. Pence and his fellow Republicans have shown little interest in invoking the amendment. Dozens of people who attacked police officers, stole computers and smashed windows at the Capitol have been arrested for their role in the violence, and officials have opened 25 domestic terrorism investigations. Trump acknowledged that a new administration would take office on January 20 in a video statement after the attack but has not appeared in public. Twitter and Facebook have suspended his accounts, citing the risk of him inciting violence. Representative Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said he expected the impeachment article to come to the floor for debate as soon as Wednesday, and he thought it would pass. ""What this president did is unconscionable, and he needs to be held to account,"" McGovern told CNN. Pence was in the Capitol along with his family when Trump's supporters attacked, and he and Trump are currently not on speaking terms. Pence's office did not respond to questions about the issue. A source said last week he was opposed to the idea of using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump. Pelosi had said the House could vote to impeach Trump on the charge of insurrection if Pence did not act. Aides to House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who voted against recognizing Biden's victory, did not respond to a request for comment. House Democrats impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, but the Republican-controlled Senate voted not to convict him. Even if the House impeaches Trump again, the Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans, would not take up the charges until January 19 at the earliest, Trump's last full day in office. "
"WASHINGTON: The decision by tech companies to clamp down on President Donald Trump's ability to speak to followers through mainstream social media may force him to tap more traditional methods of communication or more isolated conservative online channels during his final days in office, experts say. Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc-owned Google, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc took their strongest actions yet against Trump to limit his reach, fearing continued violence stemming from his posts after his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol building last week. They were joined by smaller tech companies including Twitch, Snapchat, Reddit, Shopify and TikTok. Trump, who has without evidence challenged the validity of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's Nov. 3 election victory, praised and egged on supporters before they laid siege on Wednesday to the Capitol, where lawmakers were certifying the Electoral College vote for Biden. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died in the assault. Apple, Google and Amazon have suspended Parler - a pro- Trump app where users have threatened more violence - from their respective app stores and Web-hosting services, a set of moves that stand to severely handicap the service. The platform has 12 million users and Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric are active on it, but it will now have to find a new Web host to replace Amazon to even stay in business. How can Trump reach his followers?Immediately after the Twitter ban - a platform the president has been obsessed with since he first ran for office and where he regularly spoke to his 88 million followers - Trump vowed he would ""not be SILENCED!"" and promised a ""big announcement soon."" Trump also tweeted from the @POTUS Twitter account shortly after the ban and railed against the tech company, Democrats and a law protecting internet companies called Section 230, and said he was considering building his own social media platform. His tweets were almost immediately deleted by the company. But striking out on his own will take time. For the moment, Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20, is left with alternatives such as online conservative platform Gab, a free-speech network with almost no censorship rules, that has far less of a reach. Aides and supporters are already turning to Gab and the platform MeWe to amplify his messages in the coming days, experts said. Other likely outlets are video platform Rumble and video streaming service DLive, along with alternate news sites such as American Media Periscope, said Monica Stephens, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo, whose research focuses on topics including social media. ""I don't think Trumpwill join these smaller platforms himself. It is more likely he will create something on his own as opposed to joining something subjected to somebody else's controls,"" she said. In the meantime, he can tap Trump-friendly networks such as Fox News, OAN and Newsmax to gethismessageout. The other underutilized option is the White House press office, experts said. He can continue to hold briefings or distribute statements and videos until the end of his term. What are his followers and supporters saying?Immediately after the Twitter ban, backers such as Angela Stanton-King, a Republican supporter of the QAnon conspiracy group who ran in November to represent Georgia's 5th Congressional District, and Republican Representative Thomas Massie began sharing their Parler accounts on Twitter, encouraging followers to move there. Others such as conservative media host Rush Limbaugh deactivated their Twitter accounts. Numerous Republican lawmakers denounced the social media company decisions as an attempt to stifle conservative voices and argued the moves would further polarize the country. ""We're now living in a country where four or five companies - unelected, unaccountable - have the power, a monopoly power to decide, we're going to wipe people out, we're going to just erase them from any sort of digital platform,"" Senator Marco Rubio said on Fox News. Some liberal free-speech activists were uncomfortable with the moves too. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, defended the right of Twitter and others to ""curate their platforms,"" but called for more transparency and consistency in decision making. The American Civil Liberties Union said it ""should concern everyone when companies like Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions."" Can online platforms silence Trump and his followers?Silicon Valley companies have frequently tried, often without much success, to go after those peddling harmful content - from election disinformation to hate speech and violent threats - but their actions in recent days have been the toughest so far. The First Amendment guaranteeing free speech does not generally apply to private-sector companies, allowing them to moderate speech that incites violence on their platforms. ""I think there was a legitimate public policy interest over the last four-plus years in maintaining the president and his voice on Twitter and other platforms. But clearly, what he has done has exceeded any reasonable public policy interest,"" said Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. "
"NEW DELHI: When the world is condemning the US President Donald Trump over the Capitol Hill violence last week, West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Dilip Ghosh on Monday has compared chief minister Mamata Banerjee with Trump saying both have 'dictatorial attitude.'  Speaking to ANI, Ghosh said, ""Mamataji has a dictatorial attitude like Trump, who does not believe in democracy. There is a possibility of a situation like America in West Bengal after her defeat in the Assembly elections. She will not leave Nabanno. In the past, she had attacked inside the Assembly and broke the chair tables. She had to pay fine for this.""  Bengal BJP president's comment came in the backdrop of Capitol Hill incident in Washington on Wednesday when supporters of Trump stormed the building to protest the Electoral College vote, forcing a lockdown and confrontations with the police. At least five people were killed in the riot.  Ghosh accused Bannerjee of anarchy in Bengal, saying there is 'no sign of democracy' in the state as well as in Trinamool Congress (TMC). ""This is the reason everyone in her party is leaving and running away,"" he added.  Blaming the TMC supremo, he further stated, ""Mamataji does not allow our leaders to land their helicopters...does not give permission of the fields to address a public rally. Stones were pelted at our national president's convoy.""  Ghosh emphasised BJP takes election results sportingly and its leaders happily sat on the opposition benches in many states after losing the polls. He exuded confidence that his party will form the next government in the upcoming Assembly elections.  The State BJP President slammed Banerjee for demanding the withdrawal of the new farm laws. ""If Mamataji is truly sympathetic to farmers, then why did she not implement the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme in the state depriving 73 lakh farmers?"" pointed out Ghosh.  He defended the farm laws terming a 'revolutionary' step by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said the entire nation is supporting it. ""Only a few people are opposing the laws and the Government is holding talks with them,"" Ghosh asserted.  He also attacked Mamata Banerjee alleging her of doing politics over Covid-19 vaccine. ""She has a habit of doing politics in everything. She has changed the names of central schemes in the state to earn credit. For vaccination, she does not have the budget but still making vague statements,"" claimed Ghosh.  His response comes after Banerjee's announcement on Sunday when she claimed that the Trinamool Congress government would provide 'free vaccine to all.'  West Bengal is gearing up for the upcoming Assembly Election for 294 seats this year. The tenure of the current government in the state of West Bengal is coming to an end on May 30. "
"WILMINGTON: Melania Trump said Monday that she is âdisappointed and disheartenedâ by the deadly riot at the Capitol last week by supporters of her husband. But in breaking her silence, she also lashed out at people she said have used the tragic event to spread âsalacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks and false and misleading accusations about me."" The statement marked the first lady's first public comment in the five days since a violent mob of Trump supporters, angry over Trump's election loss and stirred up by the president himself, stormed the Capitol on Wednesday and temporarily disrupted proceedings certifying that Democrat Joe Biden will be the next president come January 20. âI am disappointed and disheartened with what happened last week,â she wrote in a White House blog post released before sunrise. âI find it shameful that surrounding these tragic events there has been salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations on me â from people who are looking to be relevant and have an agenda.â The first lady did not say who she was referring to. Last week, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, the first lady's former friend and one-time assistant at the White House, wrote an editorial accusing Mrs Trump of being âcomplicit in the destruction of America.â Their friendship ended bitterly after Wolkoff, who had worked on arranging festivities for Trump's inauguration in 2017, said the first lady failed to defend her after questions arose about inaugural spending, now the subject of federal and congressional investigations. In the post Monday, the first lady said, âThis time is solely about healing our country and its citizens. It should not be used for personal gain.â âOur Nation must heal in a civil manner,â she wrote. âMake no mistake about it, I absolutely condemn the violence that has occurred on our Nation's Capitol. Violence is never acceptable.â She also urged people to stop the violence, not judge people by the colour of their skin or ""use differing political ideologies as a basis for aggression and viciousness.â She made no comment about her husband or his role in encouraging his supporters to go to the Capitol. The president has spent the weeks after losing the November presidential contest spreading baseless claims that the balloting was tainted by massive fraud and that the election was stolen from him. Numerous state and federal officials, including former US Attorney General William Barr, said there was no evidence of fraud on a scale massive enough to have affected the outcome. Trump encouraged his supporters to flock to Washington last Wednesday, the day set for Congress to certify the presidential vote. After addressing a rally near the White House in which he encouraged his supporters to keep fighting, they stormed the Capitol. Five people, including a Capitol police officer, died. "
"LOS ANGELES: The PGA of America pulled the 2022 PGA Championship from the Trump National at Bedminster course in New Jersey on Sunday, days after supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the US Capitol. ""The PGA of America Board of Directors voted tonight to exercise the right to terminate the agreement to play the 2022 PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster,"" PGA of America President Jim Richerson said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""It has become clear that conducting the PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand and would put at risk the PGA's ability to deliver our many programs and sustain the longevity of our mission,"" Richerson added in a video posted on the organization's website. The announcement on the fate of one of the four major championships in golf follows increased calls in the golf world for leaders of the sport to distance themselves from Trump. Golfweek, in a scathing column urging the game to sever ties with the president, said the PGA of America had been debating for two years whether to move the organization's flagship event but had been nervous about antagonizing a ""famously vindictive man."" ""The PGA of America Board of Directors voted tonight to exercise the right to terminate the agreement to play the 2â¦ https://t.co/pPqHXKJzis— PGA of America (@PGA) 1610334063000Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election in November to Democratic rival Joe Biden, could face a historic second impeachment before Biden's January 20 inauguration amid continued fury over the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday by angry Trump supporters that left five people dead. Trump's repeated false claims of election fraud, and his incendiary address to protesters prior to the attack on the Capitol have prompted critics to call for his resignation, his impeachment, or his removal from office as unfit under the Constitution's 25th amendment. Trump is an avid fan and player of golf -- making numerous trips to play at Bedminster during his presidency. Golf greats Gary Player and Annika Sorenstam came in for criticism when they accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump on Thursday -- a day after the chaos in Washington. Golf Digest, while noting that 15-time major champion Tiger Woods had also accepted the honor from Trump in May, called it a ""tone deaf"" gesture in an editorial calling for the sport to distance itself from Trump. Trump's divisive rhetoric had long posed a problem for a game he has been identified with. The US Golf Association resisted calls to move the 2017 US Women's Open from Trump National at Bedminster following comments on women made by Trump during his election campaign. In 2016, the PGA Tour announced it was moving the 2017 World Golf Championship to Mexico from its home at Trump's famed Doral course in Miami. The Tour insisted at the time the decision was not related to Trump's politics but admitted attracting a sponsor for the tournament had been challenging. ""Donald Trump is a brand, a big brand, and when you're asking a company to invest millions of dollars in branding a tournament and they're going to share that brand with the host, it's a difficult decision,"" PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said at the time. In Britain meanwhile, Trump's hopes of staging a British Open at his Turnberry golf course in Scotland have also been frustrated. Turnberry hosted the most recent of its four Open championships in 2009. However in 2015, the Royal & Ancient, the governing body for golf, reportedly ruled out any chance of Turnberry staging the 2020 Open following racist remarks made by Trump during his presidential campaign. ""2020 will not happen here. Turnberry will be back. But perhaps not Trump Turnberry,"" an R&A official said at the time. "
"Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger compared the mob that stormed the US Capitol to the Nazis and called President Donald Trump a failed leader who ``will go down in history as the worst president ever.'' The Republican said in a video he released on social media on Sunday that ``Wednesday was the Night of Broken Glass right here in the United States.`` In 1938, Nazis in Germany and Austria vandalized Jewish homes, schools and businesses during an attack that became known as Kristallnacht or ``the Night of Broken Glass.`` ``The broken glass was in the windows of the United States Capitol. But the mob did not just shatter the windows of the Capitol, they shattered the ideas we took for granted,`` he said. ``They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded.'' Schwarzenegger, who was born in Austria, compared the Proud Boys _ a far-right American extremist group _ to the Nazis. Some Proud Boys leaders were arrested in the nation's capital, before and after Wednesday's riots. ``President Trump sought to overturn the results of the election _ and of a fair election,`` Schwarzenegger said in the video. ``He sought a coup by misleading people with lies.'' Schwarzenegger called Trump a failed leader and said he took solace that Trump's presidency was coming to an end and ``would soon be as irrelevant as an old tweet.'' He called for national unity and vowed his support for President-elect Joe Biden after mobs loyal to Trump broke into the US Capitol, causing a temporary suspension of the electoral count. Members of Congress later returned and certified the results. Five people died, including a Capitol police officer. Scores of rioters have been arrested and many more are being sought after the brazen attack. ``And to those who think they can overturn the United States Constitution, know this: You will never win,'' Schwarzenegger said. During the video, which runs for more than seven and a half minutes, Schwarzenegger likened American democracy to the sword he brandished in his early role as ``Conan the Barbarian,'' which he said only grows stronger when it is tempered. Schwarzenegger, best known for his movie role as the Terminator, was elected as California's governor in 2003 during a special recall election. He was later elected to a full term. ``I believe, as shaken as we are about the events of recent days, we will come out stronger because we now understand what can be lost,'' he said, adding that those behind Wednesday's riots _ and those that fomented them _ will be held accountable. "
"WASHINGTON: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday the House will proceed with legislation to impeach President Donald Trump as she pushes the vice president and Cabinet to invoke constitutional authority to force him out, warning that Trump is a threat to democracy after the deadly assault on the Capitol. Pelosi made the announcement in a letter to colleagues, saying the House will first vote to push Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the powers of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. After 24 hours, she said, the House would proceed with legislation on impeachment. Trump could become the only president to be impeached twice. ``In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,'' she said, and added: ``The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.'' On Monday, Pelosi's leadership team will seek a vote on a resolution calling on Pence and Cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment. With the House not in session, there is likely to be an objection to its consideration. Pelosi would then put the resolution before the full House on Tuesday. If it were to pass, Pence and the Cabinet would have 24 hours to act before the House would move toward impeachment. With impeachment planning intensifying, pressure was mounting for Trump to leave office even before his term ended amid alarming concerns of more unrest ahead of the inauguration. Two Republican senators have now said they want Trump to resign immediately in the wake of deadly riots at the Capitol. The president whipped up the mob that stormed the Capitol, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five dead. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on Sunday joined Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in calling for Trump to ``resign and go away as soon as possible.'' ``I think the president has disqualified himself from ever, certainly, serving in office again,'' Toomey said. ``I don't think he is electable in any way.'' A growing number of lawmakers want to prevent him from ever again holding elected office. House Democrats were expected to introduce articles of impeachment on Monday. The strategy would be to condemn the president's actions swiftly but delay an impeachment trial in the Senate for 100 days. That would allow President-elect Joe Biden to focus on other priorities as soon as he is inaugurated Jan. 20. Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat and a top Biden ally, laid out the ideas Sunday as the country came to grips with the siege at the Capitol by Trump loyalists trying to overturn the election results. ``Let's give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,'' Clyburn said. Murkowski, who has long voiced her exasperation with Trump's conduct in office, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply ``needs to get out.'' A third, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., did not go that far, but on Sunday he warned Trump to be ``very careful'' in his final days in office. During an interview on ``60 Minutes'' aired Sunday, Pelosi invoked the Watergate era when Republicans in the Senate told President Richard Nixon, ``It's over.'' ``That's what has to happen now,'' she said. Corporate America began to show its reaction to the Capitol riots by tying them to campaign contributions. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's CEO and President Kim Keck said it will not contribute to those lawmakers _ all Republicans _ who supported challenges to Biden's Electoral College win. The group ``will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy,`` Kim said. Citigroup did not single out lawmakers aligned with Trump's effort to overturn the election, but said it would be pausing all federal political donations for the first three months of the year. Citi's head of global government affairs, Candi Wolff, said in a Friday memo to employees, ``We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.'' House leaders, furious after the insurrection, appear determined to act against Trump despite the short timeline. Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said an impeachment trial could not begin under the current calendar before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. While many have criticized Trump, Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive in a time of unity. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that instead of coming together, Democrats want to ``talk about ridiculous things like `Let's impeach a president'`` with just days left in office. Still, some Republicans might be supportive. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said he would take a look at any articles that the House sent over. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent Trump critic, said he would ``vote the right way'' if the matter were put in front of him. The Democratic effort to stamp Trump's presidential record _ for the second time _ with the indelible mark of impeachment had advanced rapidly since the riot. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I, a leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, said Sunday that his group had 200-plus co-sponsors. The articles, if passed by the House, could then be transmitted to the Senate for a trial, with senators acting as jurors to acquit or convict Trump. If convicted, Trump would be removed from office and succeeded by the vice president. It would be the first time a U.S. president had been impeached twice. Potentially complicating Pelosi's decision about impeachment was what it meant for Biden and the beginning of his presidency. While reiterating that he had long viewed Trump as unfit for office, Biden on Friday sidestepped a question about impeachment, saying what Congress did ``is for them to decide.'' A violent and largely white mob of Trump supporters overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol on Wednesday, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden's victory over Trump in the Electoral College. Toomey appeared on CNN's ``State of the Union'' and NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Clyburn was on ``Fox News Sunday'' and CNN. Kinzinger was on ABC's ``This Week,'' Blunt was on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' and Rubio was on Fox News Channel's ``Sunday Morning Futures.'' "
"WASHINGTON: US top infectious disease specialist Dr Anthony Fauci on Sunday (local time) claimed that his words were taken out of context without his permission, in a new advertisement by the Trump campaign praising US President Donald Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate. The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials,"" Fauci said in a statement provided exclusively to CNN.  The Trump campaign had released the new advertisement last week following the president's discharge from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he was admitted for his COVID-19 treatment.  According to CNN, the 30-second ad had used a quote of Dr Fauci, in an attempt to show that he was praising Trump's response.  ""President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus, and so is America. Together we rose to meet the challenge, protecting our seniors, getting them life-saving drugs in record time, sparing no expense,"" said the narrator of the ad.  The ad then flashes to an interview with Dr Fauci in which he says, ""I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more.""  In response to Dr Fauci's allegations, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said: ""These are Dr Fauci's own words. The video is from a nationally broadcast television interview in which Dr Fauci was praising the work of the Trump Administration. The words spoken are accurate, and directly from Dr Fauci's mouth.""  On Friday, Dr Fauci had claimed that the White House had hosted a ""super spreader"" event where people were crowded and not wearing masks.  Dr Fauci has on several circumstances criticised Trump's handling of the pandemic.  Earlier this year, the White House had tried to block Dr Fauci from testifying on the Trump administration's response to the pandemic.  ""The Appropriations Committee sought Dr Anthony Fauci as a witness at next week's Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee hearing on COVID-19 response. We have been informed by an administration official that the White House has blocked Dr Fauci from testifying,"" House Appropriations Committee spokesperson Evan Hollander was quoted as saying by CNN. "
"WASHINGTON: US Vice President Mike Pence will attend the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on January 20, an event the outgoing President Donald Trump has decided to skip. According to US media outlets, word of Pence's intention to watch Biden take his oath of office in person spread after the first major break between him and Trump -- when the Vice President defied the President by performing his constitutional duty to certify the November 3 election results. Trump, a Republican, announced on Twitter, before his account was suspended, that he would not be attending Biden's inauguration. Pence will attend the inauguration of President-elect Biden, CNN reported, quoting a source familiar with the plans. Biden, a Democrat, said on Friday that he was glad President Trump decided not to attend and that Vice President Pence is ""welcome to come. I'd be honoured to have him there."" ""It's a good thing, him not showing up,"" Biden said on Friday in Wilmington, Delaware, at a news conference. ""He exceeded even my worst notions about him. He's been an embarrassment to the country, embarrassed us around the world. He's not worthy to hold that office,"" Biden said. The decision is Pence's second high-profile split from Trump, after standing loyally behind him for years. Despite pressure from Trump, Pence affirmed Biden's victory when the US Congress finished tallying Electoral College votes early on Thursday. Trump had called for Pence to show ""extreme courage"" by rejecting the certification process. Trump has spent weeks falsely claiming the November presidential election was rigged, culminating in a violent mob of his supporters overtaking the Capitol on Wednesday and leading to the deaths of five people, including a police officer. Former US presidents Barack Obama, George Bush and Bill Clinton are also expected to attend the scaled-down inauguration, sans the traditional parade and crowds on the National Mall. The congressional committee that plans the inauguration ceremony has said that the swearing-in will take place on the Capitol's West Front as planned, despite the unprecedented events of Wednesday. The team planning the ceremony has advised people to not travel to Washington because of coronavirus risks. "
"WASHINGTON: Barely 11 months after President Donald Trump was acquitted in a momentous Senate trial, the nation now confronts the possibility of yet another impeachment battle in the twilight of his presidency, a final showdown that will test the boundaries of politics, accountability and the Constitution. No president has ever been impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors twice. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was weighing bringing a new article of impeachment to the House floor as early as Monday charging Trump with âincitement of insurrectionâ for encouraging the mob that ransacked the Capitol to disrupt the solemn process finishing his own election defeat. If Pelosi proceeds, the House could approve the article in days, this time with the support of even some disaffected Republicans, sending it to the Senate for a new trial unlike any of the previous three in American history. While it seemed unlikely that 17 Senate Republicans would join Democrats for the two-thirds majority necessary for conviction, the anger at Trump was so palpable that party leaders said privately it was not out of the question. The fresh bid to remove Trump from office and strip him of his power without waiting until his term expires Jan. 20 capped a traumatic week that rattled Washington more than any since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as National Guard troops stood watch over the Capitol and downtown businesses remained boarded up. Emotions were raw. The White House was in meltdown. The military was on edge. The Cabinet was in revolt. The Republican Party was in civil war. And an unrepentant president was in hiding, stripped of his social media bullhorn, ostracized by many allies and at odds even with his staff and loyal vice president. The storming of the Capitol by Trumpâs supporters that left five people dead, among them a police officer, transformed the politics of the city in ways that were still hard to measure. A new impeachment would be more than a do-over of the drive that failed last year because this time the offense was not a phone call to a foreign leader captured on the dry pages of a transcript but the siege of American democracy played out live on television for all to see. âInsurrectionists incited by Mr. Trump attacked our nationâs Capitol to stop Congress from accepting the Electoral College results,â said Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who began drafting the article of impeachment with Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island while sheltering during the Capitol takeover and was later joined by Jamie Raskin of Maryland. âPeople died. We cannot just issue sternly worded press releases as a response. Unless Trump resigns, Congress must impeach to hold him accountable.â Yet the timing of such an effort, with just 11 days until Trump is to leave office, scrambled the equation. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, indicated that under Senate rules a trial could not begin until Jan. 19, the day before President-elect Joe Bidenâs inauguration, meaning the process would not advance quickly enough to avert any feared dangerous moves in Trumpâs last days in power. That raised the prospect of conducting a trial after Trump vacates the White House, overshadowing the opening days of Bidenâs administration at a time when he would like to turn the page and confront crises like the coronavirus pandemic, which has grown even deadlier while attention has focused on Washingtonâs political wars. A nationally televised trial could dominate discussion and would prevent other business in the Senate. âIf the House does send articles of impeachment over, they really get the Biden administration off to a bad start,â Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said in an interview Saturday. âWhether thatâs the first 10 days or the first 20 days of the Biden administration, itâs certainly not how youâd want to start your presidency off.â Some of Trumpâs critics argued that it would be important to hold a trial even if he is already out of power in order to bar him from ever seeking office again, a penalty envisioned by the Constitution â and perhaps more important, to render a verdict condemning his actions for the sake of history. âWeâve never had to consider even the possibility of impeaching a president twice, or in the final days of his presidency,â said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional scholar at the University of North Carolina who testified in Trumpâs first impeachment and favors another trial. âBut weâve never had a president before whoâs encouraging sedition as Trump has done in his last few days in office.â Yet even some of the presidentâs harshest critics worried that a last-minute impeachment and an overtime trial could help him rally supporters by presenting himself as a victim not a villain, allowing him to turn the focus from his own actions to those of his opponents. âIt historically will be important,â said Andrew Weissmann, who was a deputy to special counsel Robert Mueller and recently published a book, âWhere Law Ends,â expressing frustration that the president was not held fully accountable for his actions during the Russia investigation. âBut the danger is he is acquitted and the momentum of condemnation now is lost. Plus, until we change the mentality of his base, we have not gotten at the underlying issue.â At the moment, a strong majority of Americans holds Trump responsible for the attack, with 63% saying he has a good amount or even a great deal of blame, according to a PBS Newshour-Marist poll. But when asked whether steps should be taken to remove him from office as a result, Americans retreated to their partisan corners, with 48% saying yes and 49% saying no. A Reuters-Ipsos survey found that 57% of Americans want Trump to leave office right away. But most of them favored removal by Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet through the disability clause of the 25th Amendment, with just 14% calling for another impeachment. Trump has few defenders among Republican officeholders for exhorting the crowd before it marched on the Capitol and even some in the conservative news media turned on him, most notably The Wall Street Journal editorial page, which called his actions âimpeachableâ and urged him to resign. Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, told Fox News on Saturday that âthe president committed impeachable offenses,â joining at least three other Senate Republicans who have called on Trump to resign, expressed openness to impeachment or voted for conviction last year. But in the face of impeachment threats, some Republicans began taking up the fight against his opponents again. They may not like Trump or believe it is politically viable to be seen as excusing his behavior but many are still energized by battling his enemies on the left. On Sean Hannityâs Fox News program Friday night, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was accosted by Trump supporters at an airport for opposing the presidentâs efforts to overturn the election, was suddenly back to castigating Trumpâs rivals and talking about Hunter Biden. Graham focused on Trumpâs video message Thursday calling for healing and reconciliation, a video the president privately expressed regret for making. âInstead of trying to match what President Trump has done, the radical Democrats are talking about another impeachment that will destroy the country even further,â Graham said. Still, Trump might have a challenge finding lawyers to defend him in any trial. Jay Sekulow, who was a leader of the defense team in the impeachment trial last year, called the idea of a second impeachment a âgigantic mistakeâ by Democrats during a radio show, but has not participated in Trumpâs legal efforts to overturn Bidenâs election and did not respond to a message asking if he would represent the president again. Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel who teamed up with Sekulow, has been so upset about the Capitol attack that he has considered resigning. One of the few members of his defense team who said he would stick with the president was Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School emeritus professor who had a secondary role last time. In an email Saturday, he said he would defend Trump on free expression grounds. âTrumpâs speech, whatever one may think of it on the merits, is clearly protected by the First Amendment,â he said. âTo impeach him for a constitutionally protected speech would violate both the First Amendment and the constitutional criteria for impeachment and would do enduring damage to the Constitution.â Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor who testified in the House against Trumpâs first impeachment, said the latest drive was a rush to judgment out of partisan anger. The fact that Trumpâs critics have called for him to be removed either by impeachment or the 25th Amendment, he said, showed that they are interested only in the outcome, not the legitimacy of the method. âThis opportunistic use of impeachment would do to the Constitution what the rioters did to the Capitol: leave it in tatters,â Turley said. âThe Democrats should not repeat one impulsive, destructive act in the Capitol with another in such an impeachment.â The House voted almost entirely on party lines to impeach Trump in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with his effort to pressure Ukraine to incriminate Biden in wrongdoing while withholding vital security aid. But the Senate acquitted him last February also on a nearly party-line vote. A second impeachment would in some ways revise how that first one looks in history. Some have argued that focusing on the Ukraine episode was too narrow given Trumpâs many actions violating norms in Washington. Others have said it served as a warning that the president would use his power to cheat in an election, a forecast now borne out. While there is scholarly debate about whether an official can be impeached or tried after leaving office, there is precedent. When William Belknap, the war secretary under President Ulysses S. Grant, was accused of corruption, he rushed to the White House to submit his resignation minutes before the House impeached him. Lawmakers proceeded anyway and the Senate went ahead and put him on trial, although it acquitted him. The Constitution specifically provides for the Senate to bar anyone convicted from holding federal office in the future, a secondary penalty that can be approved in a separate vote but requires only a simple majority of 51 senators rather than two-thirds. The Senate has applied this penalty to impeached judges in the past. âAt some point, democracies have to be able to defend themselves,â said Corey Brettschneider, an impeachment expert at Brown University. âThe framers probably didnât give us enough to protect us against a president, but disqualification is one thing they rightly did give us.â "
"WASHINGTON: With only days left in his presidency, Donald Trump - silenced by Twitter and shunned by a growing number of Republican officials - faces a renewed drive by Democrats to remove him from office after he incited his supporters to storm the US Capitol. Democratic members of the House of Representatives will introduce formal articles of impeachment on Monday, Representative Ted Lieu said on Twitter. The California Democrat, who helped draft the charges, said the articles had drawn 180 co-sponsors as of Saturday afternoon. A spokeswoman for Lieu said no Republicans have yet signed on. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top congressional Democrat, has threatened to impeach Trump for a historic second time unless he resigned ""immediately,"" a move the pugnacious president is unlikely to consider. Pelosi has also asked members to draft legislation aimed at invoking the US Constitution's 25th Amendment, which allows the removal of a president unable to fulfill the duties of the office. Trump ""has done something so serious -- that there should be prosecution against him,"" Pelosi told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" according to an early excerpt of the interview. The intensifying effort to oust Trump from the White House has drawn scattered support from Republicans, whose party has been splintered by the president's actions. Democrats have pressed Vice President Mike Pence to consider the 25th Amendment, but a Pence adviser has said he opposes the idea. The odds that Trump will actually be removed before Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in, remain long. Any impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is scheduled to be in recess until Jan. 19 and has already acquitted Trump once before. Trump has said he will not be at Biden's inauguration, but Pence will attend, a senior administration official said on Saturday. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent a memo to his fellow Republican senators suggesting a trial would not begin until Trump was out of office, a source familiar with the document said. A conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds vote. Democrats will take control of the Senate later this month, after Georgia certifies two runoff elections won by Democratic challengers. Twitter permanently cut off Trump's personal account and access to his nearly 90 million followers late on Friday, citing the risk of further incitement of violence, three days after Trump exhorted thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Biden's Nov. 3 election victory. The resulting assault, viewed with shock around the world, left a police officer and four others dead in its wake, as rioters breached the Capitol and forced lawmakers into hiding for their own safety. In his first public comments, Pope Francis said he was ""astonished"" and that anyone engaged in attacks on democracy must be condemned. A Florida man who was photographed smiling and waving as he carried Pelosi's lectern from the House chambers amid the chaos was arrested by federal law enforcement late Friday. Authorities also arrested a man seen in widely shared photographs wearing a horned fur hat and carrying a spear inside the Capitol. Dozens of others face federal and state charges. 'I WANT HIM OUT' Twitter's decision stifled one of Trump's most potent tools. His frequent posts helped propel his 2016 presidential campaign, since which he has used the site to fire up his base and attack his political opponents from both parties. Trump later used the official @POTUS government account to lash out at Twitter, saying the 75 million ""great patriots"" who voted for him would not be silenced, and that he was considering building his own social media platform. Twitter quickly deleted those posts and soon after suspended the Trump campaign account as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Thursday and Friday found 57%of Americans want Trump to be removed immediately from office following the violence. A small but growing number of Republicans have joined calls for Trump to step down, and several high-ranking administration officials resigned in protest. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Friday that Trump should resign immediately and suggested she would consider leaving the party altogether if Republicans cannot separate themselves from him. ""I want him out. He has caused enough damage,"" she told the Anchorage Daily News. Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told Fox News on Saturday that Trump had ""committed impeachable offenses"" but declined to commit to voting in favor of Trump's removal. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News he would ""definitely consider"" impeachment because the president ""disregarded his oath of office."" Trump allies, including Senator Lindsey Graham and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, however, urged Democrats to shelve any impeachment effort in the name of unity. ""Impeaching President Donald Trump with 12 days remaining in his presidency would only serve to further divide the country,"" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. Democratic lawmakers have also called for some of their Republican colleagues to resign or be expelled over their roles supporting Trump's unfounded claims of a rigged election. Sherrod Brown, Democratic senator from Ohio, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, who called for Electoral College votes of states that voted for Biden to be rejected, had ""betrayed their oaths of office and abetted a violent insurrection on our democracy."" ""If they do not resign, the Senate must expel them,"" said Brown, the first senator to call for the pair to be expelled. Representative Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, also called on McCarthy to resign for backing efforts to block Biden's election. A copy of draft articles of impeachment circulating among members of Congress charged Trump with ""inciting violence against the government of the United States"" in a bid to overturn his loss to Biden. The House impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, but the Senate acquitted him in February 2020. Only two other presidents have been impeached, and none has been impeached twice. Trump spent months falsely claiming the election was stolen from him due to widespread fraud. Dozens of courts across the country have thrown out lawsuits challenging the results, and election officials from both parties have said there is no evidence to support his allegations. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump delighted supporters gathered near the White House on Saturday with a slow motorcade drive-by through downtown Washington on the way to his Virginia golf club. A week after the presidential race was called for Democrat Joe Biden, thousands of Trump loyalists converged on the nation's capital to protest the election results and falsely assert the vote was stolen. Trump persists with his claims and complaints even though a broad coalition of top government and industry officials has declared that the Nov. 3 voting and the following count unfolded smoothly with no more than the usual minor hiccups _ ``the most secure in American history,'' they said, repudiating his efforts to undermine the integrity of the contest. The crowd cheered as Trump's limousine neared and people lined both sides of the street. Some stood just a few feet away from Trump's vehicle; others showed their enthusiasm by running along with the caravan. They chanted ``USA, USA'' and ``four more years,'' and many carried American flags and signs to show their displeasure with the vote tally. After making the short detour for the slow drive around Freedom Plaza, where people were gathering for the afternoon rally, the motorcade headed to the president's club. After an hour of speeches from Trump loyalists from around the country, the flag-waving crowd set off toward the Supreme Court. The ``Million MAGA March'' was heavily promoted on social media, raising concerns that it could spark conflict with anti-Trump demonstrators, who have gathered near the White House in Black Lives Matter Plaza for weeks. In preparation, police closed off wide swaths of downtown, where many stores and offices have been boarded up since Election Day. Chris Rodriguez, director of the city's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said the police were experienced at keeping the peace. ``People who come to the District know that you can't bring weapons to our city and that violence will not be tolerated,'' Rodriguez said. The issues that Trump's campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: problems with signatures, secrecy envelops and postal marks on mail-in ballots, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost. With Biden leading Trump by wide margins in key battleground states, none of those issues would have any impact on the outcome of the election. Trump's campaign has also filed legal challenges complaining that their poll watchers were unable to scrutinize the voting process. Many of those challenges have been tossed out by judges, some within hours of their filing. "
"Twitter yanked the plug on Donald Trump's account permanently on Friday, in a move described as 'long overdue' by many and 'an attack on free speech' by others. Trump, predictably, didn't go quietly, promising that he'd be ""building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!"" The provocative handle was given birth by a New York real estate tycoon who used it to help him become the 45th US president. It began with a May 4, 2009, tweet promoting Donald Trump's upcoming appearance on David Letterman's show. It died more than 57,000 tweets later, with Trump using some of his final postings on the powerful platform to commiserate with a mob that besieged the halls of Congress in a deadly assault as lawmakers were set to certify his defeat. ""After close review of recent tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them â specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter â we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,"" Twitter said in a statement on Friday. At the time of permanent suspension, Trump had 88.7 million followers and followed 51 people. In the Trump tweets cited by Twitter, Trump stated that he would not be attending the inauguration and referred to his supporters as ""American Patriots,'' who will have ""a GIANT VOICE long into the future.'' Twitter said these statements ""are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.'' Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state Capitol buildings on January 17, it said. Twitter also permanently banned two Trump loyalists -- former national security adviser Michael Flynn and attorney Sidney Powell -- as part of a broader purge of accounts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory. In a statement hours after he was banned, Trump said: ""I predicted this would happen. We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!"" ""Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH. They are all about promoting a Radical Left platform where some of the most vicious people in the world are allowed to speak freely. ""STAY TUNED!""' he said, indicating some announcements in this regard is forthcoming. Several Republican leaders, including popular Indian-American politician Nikki Haley, also condemned Twitter. ""Silencing people, not to mention the President of the US, is what happens in China not our country,â tweeted Haley. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, took to Twitter to note that it continues to allow Iran's supreme leader ""and numerous other dictatorial regimes'' to use the platform, but cannot abide his father. ""Mao would be proud,'' Trump Jr. scoffed. Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of journalism and media at the University of North Carolina, said the move lets Twitter try to curry favor with the incoming Biden administration. Trump ""only has two weeks left in power, and that certainly makes it easier to deplatform the president,'' she said. Others saw a more ominous portent in Twitter's action. ""Big Tech is not going to stop with the president of the United States,"" Kay James, president of the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a tweet. ""They can ban you next and everyone reading this."" But Jonathan Greenblatt, who heads the Anti-Defamation League, said that banning Trump was an ""excellent step"" and ""a fitting end to a legacy of spewing hate and vitriol"". The ADL was part of a coalition of civil rights and advocacy groups on Friday calling for Twitter to ban Trump's account. Democratic Rep Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement Friday that Facebook and YouTube should also ban Trump. Twitter, long accused of treating the president with kid gloves, began policing Trump more aggressively starting in the early days of the general presidential campaign, when the company began aggressively labeling his false tweets about supposedly widespread election fraud as disputed. In May, after Trump tweeted the phrase ``when the looting starts, the shooting starts'' in response to protests in Minneapolis, Twitter added a warning label to his post for the first time. Tensions between Trump and Twitter only escalated from there. "
"WASHINGTON: US lawmakers are preparing to impeach Donald Trump a second time amid belated recognition in the country's mainstream political leadership that its President could be an unhinged man who poses a danger to America and the world and therefore should not be in charge of nuclear weapons. In an extraordinary and unprecedented move in US history, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly told her colleagues on Friday that she has spoken to Pentagonâs top general about keeping an âunstable presidentâ from accessing nuclear codes ""This morning, I spoke to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike,"" Pelosi is said to have told them, ""The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy."" The idea that Trump is a fruitcake with psychological disorders has long animated public discourse, but this is the first time a prominent leader has openly called him unstable and unhinged, skirting the so-called âGoldwater Rule,â which bars shrinks from diagnosing public figures for mental issues without proper examination. Trump began his Presidency with cavalier statements and inquiries about use of nuclear weapons but has since dialed down such talk. Constraining the volatile US President smarting over electoral defeat came even as Democratic lawmakers readied a single impeachment article -- charging him with ""incitement of insurrection"" -- they plan to introduce on Monday. While the Democrat-controlled House, where only a simple majority is required to impeach, is expected to rush through the process, it faces a tougher path in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to convict the President in a chamber tied at 50-50, if the two new Democratic Senators from Georgia are sworn in before the matter reachers the chamber. But indicative of the shifting dynamics in the GOP, several Republican Senators are expected to support the impeachment move, some simply to put Trump out of politics. Many establishment Republicans are enraged at Trump's continued support for the extremist MAGA crowd, some of whom stormed the US Capitol looking for Mike Pence because the vice-president did not do the defeated President's bidding to subvert the election results. Some party stalwarts are also shocked by reports of authorities finding home made bombs and guns during the storming of the Capitol. Video clips of the mob chanting ""Hang Mike Pence!"" and photos of a noose outside the capitol, and of extremists in combat gear with zip ties ostensibly looking for hostages, has rattled the political leadership. On Friday, Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski indicated she was considering leaving the party if it continued to back Trump, even as party's majority leader Mitch Connell, whose wife Elaine Chao quit the Trump cabinet, greenlighted the impeachment process in the Senate. McConnell reportedly told his Republican colleagues that the earliest a second impeachment trial of Trump would begin is January 20th, Biden's inauguration day, after some constitutional experts said a President could be impeached even after he leaves office, with a conviction forestalling another run for the White House. Trump has indicated he plans to run again in 2024, and political pundits say some establishment Republicans may be ready to scupper that. The Republican schism is now taking on a menacing tone for some lawmakers, including Trump minions who the MAGA base believes did not adequately defend the defeated President. Utah Republican SenatorsMitt Romney and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, a Trump surrogate, are among those who have been accosted at airports by angry and abusive Trump supporters.\ "
"WASHINGTON: Warnings flashing, Democrats in Congress laid plans for swift impeachment of President Donald Trump, demanding decisive, immediate action to ensure an ""unhinged"" commander in chief can't add to the damage they say he's inflicted or even ignite nuclear war in his final days in office. As the country comes to terms with the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters that left five dead, the crisis that appears to be among the final acts of his presidency is deepening like few others in the nation's history. With less than two weeks until he's gone, Democrats want him out _ now - and he has few defenders speaking up for him in his own Republican Party. ""We must take action,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared Friday on a private conference call with Democrats. And one prominent Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News that Trump simply ``needs to get out.'' The final days of Trump's presidency are spinning toward a chaotic end as he holes up at the White House, abandoned by many aides, top Republicans and Cabinet members. After refusing to concede defeat in the November election, he has now promised a smooth transfer of power when Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. But even so, he says he will not attend the inauguration _ the first such presidential snub since just after the Civil War. In Congress, where many have watched and reeled as the president spent four years breaking norms and testing the nation's guardrails of democracy, Democrats are unwilling to take further chances. The mayhem that erupted Wednesday at the Capitol stunned the world and threatened the traditional peaceful transfer of power. Pelosi said she had spoken to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley ``to discuss available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes`` for nuclear war. She said Milley assured her longstanding safeguards are in place. The president has sole authority to order the launch of a nuclear weapon, but a military commander could refuse the order if it were determined to be illegal. Trump has not publicly made such threats, but officials warn of grave danger if the president is left unchecked. ``This unhinged president could not be more dangerous,'' Pelosi said of the current situation. Biden, meanwhile, said he is focused on his job as he prepares to take office. Asked about impeachment, he said, ``That's a decision for the Congress to make.'' The Democrats are considering lightning-quick action. A draft of their Articles of Impeachment accuses Trump of abuse of power, saying he ``willfully made statements that encouraged _ and foreseeably resulted in _ imminent lawless action at the Capitol,`` according to a person familiar with the details who was granted anonymity to discuss them. The articles are expected to be introduced on Monday, with a House vote as soon as Wednesday. If Trump were to be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, he might also be prevented from running again for the presidency in 2024 or ever holding public office again. He would be the only president twice impeached. A person on the call said Pelosi also discussed other ways Trump might be forced to resign. Senators from a bipartisan group convened their own call to consider options for congressional action, according to an aide granted anonymity to reveal the private discussions. Not helpful, the White House argued. Trump spokesman Judd Deere said, ``A politically motivated impeachment against a President with 12 days remaining in his term will only serve to further divide our great country.'' Trump was tweeting again Friday, his Twitter account reinstated after a brief ban, and he reverted to an aggressive statement that his supporters must not be ``disrespected'' after he had sent out a calmer Thursday video decrying the violence. Toward evening, Twitter said it was permanently suspending him from its platform, citing ``risk of further incitement of violence.'' The soonest the Senate could begin an impeachment trial under the current calendar would be Jan. 20, Inauguration Day. Conviction in the Republican Senate at this late date would seem unlikely, though in a sign of Trump's shattering of the party many Republicans were silent on the issue. One Trump ally, Republican Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, did speak up, saying as the White House did that ``impeaching the President with just 12 days left in his term will only divide our country more. '' McCarthy said he has reached out to Biden and plans to speak with the Democratic president-elect about working together to ``lower the temperature.'' But Murkowski said she wants Trump to resign now, not wait for Biden's swearing in on Jan. 20. ``I want him out,`` she said in a telephone interview with the Anchorage newspaper. Another leading Republican critic of Trump, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, said he would ``definitely consider'' impeachment. Strong criticism of Trump, who urged the mob to march to the Capitol, continued unabated. ``Every day that he remains in office, he is a danger to the Republic,'' said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Schiff, who led Trump's impeachment in 2019, said in a statement that Trump ``lit the fuse which exploded on Wednesday at the Capitol.'' Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, tweeted that some people ask, why impeach a president who has only a few days left in office? ``The answer: Precedent. It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the U.S. government,'' Sanders said. Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer both had private calls with Biden late Friday. They have called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to force Trump from office. It's a process for removing the president and installing the vice president to take over. Pelosi said later that option remains on the table. But action by Pence or the Cabinet now appears unlikely, especially after two top officials, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, suddenly resigned in the aftermath of the violence and would no longer be in the Cabinet to make such a case. Trump had encouraged loyalists at a rally Wednesday at the White House to march on the Capitol where Congress was certifying the Electoral College tally of Biden's election. The House impeached Trump in 2019, but the Republican-led Senate acquitted him in early 2020. "
"NEW DELHI: BJP leaders expressed concern on Saturday over the permanent suspension of US President Donald Trump's Twitter account by the social media giant, saying it sets a dangerous precedent and is a wake-up call for democracies about the threat from unregulated big tech companies. Days after Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol and caused the deaths of four civilians and a police officer, Twitter suspended his account permanently on its platform due to the ""risk of further incitement of violence"". ""If they can do this to the President of the US (POTUS), they can do this to anyone.

In a statement on Friday, Twitter said after a close review of recent tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around those -- specifically how those are being received and interpreted on and off the social media platform -- the account has been permanently suspended due to the risk of further incitement of violence. At the time of the permanent suspension, Trump had 88.7 million followers and followed 51 people. "
"Kim Jong Un will put North Korea on a path to develop more advanced nuclear technologies and missiles, sending a chilling warning to President-elect Joe Biden that the Asian leader is ready to ratchet up security tensions. Kim âlaid down a fresh struggle line, and strategic and tactical policies,â at the first Congress of the Workersâ Party of Korea in five years, the stateâs Korean Central News Agency reported. The comments made at one of Kimâs most important political meetings in years offered the first significant signals of how he intends to approach a relationship with the new administration in the White House. The plans included making smaller and lighter nuclear weapons, proceeding with the development of large warheads and improving the ability to strike strategic targets within 15,000 km (9,320 miles). Kim seeks to develop solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles to strengthen intelligence-gathering capabilities with satellites, according to KCNA. The report suggests a sweeping plan for the modernization of the countryâs nuclear and conventional forces, and a reference to tactical nuclear weapons will raise global concerns, according to Ankit Panda, a Stanton Senior Fellow in the in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. âIt lights a fire under the Biden administration,â Panda said. âKim is making clear that if Biden decides not to prioritize North Korea policy, Pyongyang will resume testing and qualitatively advancing its nuclear capabilities in ways that would be seriously detrimental for Washington and Seoul.â North Korea has a history of saber rattling when a new leader takes over the White House. It tested President Barack Obama with the launch of a long-range rocket and a nuclear device within months after he took power in 2009. President Donald Trump was welcomed with a series of ballistic missile tests that culminated with the launch in November 2017 of an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said could deliver a nuclear warhead to the entire U.S. The North Korean leader, who turned 37 on Friday, hasnât made substantive comments on his weapons program since unveiling a new intercontinental ballistic missile at an October military parade. After a breakdown at a summit with Trump in Hanoi in 2019, Kim responded a few months later with tests of new solid-fuel ballistic missiles that are easier to hide, deploy and use on in a quick strike. Experts believe he has been working on a solid-fuel ICBM, which could be readied for launch quicker than his current liquid-fueled arsenal. Return of Rocket Man Kim entered 2018 saying his state had âcompletedâ its nuclear deterrent against the U.S. He put a moratorium on tests of atomic weapons and long-range missiles as he started talks with Trump. Kim may have another display of weaponry soon, with satellite imagery indicating preparations underway for a major march through central Pyongyang, the 38 North website reported. Kim issued a dire warning in opening remarks to the Party Congress of 5,000 delegates, saying the previous five-year plan fell far short of goals and the party would explore a ânew pathâ for making a âbig leap forward.â North Koreaâs sanctions-battered economy was dealt further blows last year by natural disasters and Kimâs decision to shut borders due to the coronavirus. Gross domestic product likely shrank by 8.5% in 2020, according to a projection by Fitch Solutions, leaving it smaller than when Kim took power in 2011 with a pledge to improve peopleâs living standards. Covid Crash Despite the bonhomie Kim showed in three meetings with Trump, the North Korean leader repeatedly rejected the Trump administrationâs call for a âcomplete, verifiable and irreversibleâ nuclear dismantlement before Pyongyang could receive any rewards. North Korea is likely seeking to calibrate its approach during the transition to preserve Kimâs chances of securing a deal to relieve the sanctions. While nuclear talks have sputtered Kim has been busy stockpiling fissile material. Experts estimate that North Korea has assembled 30-40 nuclear warheads, the fewest among the nine nations with nuclear weapons. The Biden administration has indicated it may be ready to ease sanctions in exchange for steps by Kim to freeze, cap and wind down his atomic arsenal. Biden has said he wants to âjump startâ a campaign with U.S. allies and others for denuclearization. Bidenâs choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in a 2017 opinion piece in the New York Times, backed a negotiated settlement with North Korea âthat first freezes and then rolls back North Koreaâs nuclear program, with inspectors to carefully scrutinize complianceâ before a more comprehensive deal is reached. âThe plan poses a direct security threat to Washington as it may target the U.S. mainland,â said Koh Yu-hwan, president of a government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification think tank in Seoul. âNorth Korea is sending a clear message that it would continue to modernize its nuclear weaponry and delivery systems if sanctions are not lifted,â Koh said.

"WASHINGTON: Concerns on Friday over US President Donald Trump's mental state have drawn focus on his power to unleash a nuclear attack. Two days after Trump supporters, under his encouragement, stormed the US Capitol and shut down Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she had contacted the Pentagon's top general, Mark Milley, to understand how to prevent ""an unhinged president"" from using the secret nuclear launch codes to order a nuclear strike. As Milley presumably told her, the US constitution gives the president the sole power to launch a nuclear weapon. Congress cannot interfere, and the leaders of the Pentagon, the generals and civilians, are bound to transmit his order, whether they agree with it or not. Everywhere he travels, the president is accompanied by an aide carrying the ""nuclear football"", a bag containing instructions, attack plans and codes for initiating a nuclear strike that only the president can use. Given the need to consider the justification, what equipment to use and what targets are chosen, such a decision would normally be done in consultation with defense chiefs. But once the president decides - whether after much deliberation or in a fit of anger - ""neither the military nor Congress can overrule these orders,"" said a December report on nuclear command and control from the Congressional Research Service. The only restriction on the US leader, in this case, is the legality of the strike. The laws of war would allow a military official to refuse to execute an order to do something illegal. ""But questions about the legality of the order - whether it is consistent with the requirements, under the laws of armed conflict for necessity, proportionality, and distinction - are more likely to lead to consultations and changes in the president's order than to a refusal by the military to execute the order,"" according to the Congressional Research Service report. If the president does decide to order a strike, he would normally consult the military chiefs for his options. In the ""football"", he would find options for the attack and communications equipment to formally order it. He would make use of a card of codes unique to himself, called the ""biscuit"", to certify his identification as the commander-in-chief empowered to order a launch. The launch order would then be transmitted to the US Strategic Command, where an officer would confirm it came from the president and execution would take place. It could be as little as two minutes from order to the launch of a ground-based nuclear-tipped missile, or 15 minutes from a submarine. ""People in the chain of command might technically refuse to obey an order, but a verified order is presumed to be legal,"" said Derek Johnson of the anti-nuclear organization Global Zero. ""Pressure to obey would be massive."" In all of this, there are no exceptions in the system of nuclear command and control for a scenario in which the president is seen to be mentally unstable and ignores the advice of his generals. In that case, the only option - which Pelosi has called for in the case of Trump - is to invoke the constitution's 25th amendment on removing a president from power. "
"WASHINGTON: @realDonaldTrump, the Twitter feed that grew from the random musings of a reality TV star into the cudgel of an American president, died Friday. It was not quite 12 years old. The provocative handle was given birth by a New York real estate tycoon who used it to help him become the 45th US president. It began with a May 4, 2009, tweet promoting Donald Trump's upcoming appearance on David Letterman's show. It died more than 57,000 tweets later, with Trump using some of his final postings on the powerful platform to commiserate with a pro-Trump mob that besieged the halls of Congress as lawmakers were set to certify his defeat. Trump one of most incompetent US Presidents: BidenThe account met its demise when Twitter announced Friday it was pulling the plug permanently on @realDonaldTrump, citing concern that Trump would use it for ""further incitement of violence."" Trump retorted that he'd be ""building out our own platform in the near future. We will not be SILENCED!"" Trump, a novice politician but seasoned salesman, realized the power of social media in ways that few other politicians did. And he wielded it with never-before-seen power to diminish his opponents, shape elections and mold reality - at least in the eyes of his supporters. Early on, @realDonaldTrump seemed innocent enough. Its owner, who had prolific experience in marketing casinos, real estate and even Oreos, used the platform mostly to promote his books, media appearances and give friendly plugs to friends. Will introduce immigration bill 'immediately' after taking office, says BidenBut as Trump began seriously toying with a White House run, it became a tool to scorch opponents and give shape to his nationalist, ""America First"" philosophy. He deployed its venom equally, whether insulting celebrity enemies (Rosie O'Donnell was ""crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb"") or entire countries (Britain is ""trying hard to disguise their massive Muslim problem""). Peter Costanzo, then an online marketing director for the publishing company putting out Trump's book, ""Think Like a Champion,"" helped bring Trump to the platform. Twitter was still in its infancy at the time. But Costanzo, who later came to work for The Associated Press, saw the then-140-character-per-message platform as a new tool that the real estate mogul could use to boost sales and reach a broader audience. Costanzo was given seven minutes to make his pitch to Trump _ ""Not five minutes, not 10,"" he recalled in a 2016 interview. Trump liked what he heard. ""I said, 'Let's call you @realDonaldTrump - you're the real Donald Trump,""' recalled Costanzo. ""He thought about it for a minute and said: 'I like it. Let's do it.""' Other than Trump's family, no one seemed off limits from his Twitter wrath. Trump attacked Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats, 2016 political rivals, current administration staffers, former administration staffers, the Republican Party and cable networks. @realDonaldTrump was prolific: On days when its owner was particularly agitated, such as in the midst of impeachment proceedings, it pushed out more than 100 tweets. In its most popular tweet, on Oct. 2, 2020, (at)realDonaldTrump announced that Trump and first lady Melania Trump had contracted the coronavirus. The post got 1.8 million likes and nearly 400,000 retweets, according to Factba.se., which tracks the president's social media habits and commentary. The account was used to announce firings. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson learned of his ouster in a tweet. The account threatened adversaries in the most colorful terms. Before Trump ""fell in love"" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un through secretly exchanged letters, Trump used Twitter to dub him ""rocket man"" and vowed to respond with ""fire and fury"" if the authoritarian dared attack the United States. (at)realDonaldTrump frequently spread misleading, false and malicious assertions, such as the baseless ideas that protesters at Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings were paid by the liberal philanthropist George Soros and that November's election was beset by voter fraud. Trump often tweeted well past midnight and before dawn, a cathartic outlet for grievances (Witch hunt! Crooked Hillary, Russia, Russia, Russia, FAKE NEWS, and so on.) For the most part, (at)realDonaldTrump and its 280-character posts effectively allowed Trump to work around the Washington media establishment and amplify the message of allies. Sometimes (at)realDonaldTrump stumbled. Trump deleted 1,166 tweets and, in his final months on the platform, had 471 tweets flagged by Twitter for misinformation, according to Factba.se. In one of his most memorable Twitter stumbles, Trump in May 2017 sent (and later deleted) a cryptic post-midnight tweet that read ""Despite the constant negative press covfefe."" The gibberish set the Twitterverse afire with speculation. Theories included that the tweeter-in-chief had fallen asleep mid-message and that the man who once bragged of having ""the best words"" was adding a new word to the lexicon to properly describe collusion between Democrats and the press. The mystery was never solved. Sam Nunberg, a longtime - and now former - Trump adviser, said that in the summer of 2011, after Trump announced he wasn't running in 2012 but wanted to remain relevant, his team decided to start using social media to boost his profile. They chose to focus on Twitter, where he already had an account and several hundred thousand followers. Nunberg remembers sending Trump daily reports on his follower growth. Trump would sometimes hand it back with hand-written notes - ""Why not more?"" ""Why so slow?"" They celebrated when they hit the million mark. ""Twitter definitely played a pivotal role in building Donald Trump as a political figure within Republican politics and he also greatly enjoyed it,"" said Nunberg. ""Remember he used to say: 'I wanted to own a newspaper. This is great, it's like a newspaper without the losses.""' Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, took to Twitter shortly after the platform banned (at)realDonaldTrump to note that it continues to allow Iran's supreme leader ""and numerous other dictatorial regimes"" to use the platform, but cannot abide his father. ""Mao would be proud,"" Trump Jr scoffed. In the end, @realDonaldTrump offered an in-the-moment peek into Trump's state of mind over more than a decade, a period in which the ""Apprentice"" TV star transformed into the 45th American president. Down the road, when historians look for a glimpse into Trump thoughts on the issues of his time -- anything from actress Kristen Stewart's treatment of co-star Robert Pattinson to the president's views on Russian meddling in the 2016 election - the first stop may inevitably be one of the many digital archives that have preserved the tweets of @realDonaldTrump. With Trump, whatever the topic, there's always a tweet for that. "
"WASHINGTON: President-elect Joe Biden has said President Donald Trump was the ""most incompetent"" presidents in US history. Sidestepping the questions related to impeachment or removal from office in the remaining 12 days, Biden said that quickest way Trump could be removed is his inauguration on January 20. ""I have been saying for now well over a year he (Trump) is not fit to serve,"" Biden said. ""He is one of the most incompetent presidents in the history of the United States of America and so the idea that I think he shouldn't be out of office yesterday is not the issue."" ""The question is what happens with 14 days left to go or 13 days left to go and I think that what 81 million people stood up and said it is time for him to go and the United States Senate voted 93-6 to confirm that we should be sworn in. We were duly elected, so I think it is important we get on with the business of getting him out of office,"" Biden told reporters in Wilmington in Delaware. ""The quickest way that that will happen is us being sworn in on the 20th. What action happens before or after that is a judgment for the Congress to make, but that is what I am looking forward to, him leaving office,"" the president-elect said. Biden said Trump had clearly demonstrated and exceeded ""even my worst notions"" about him. ""He has been an embarrassment to the country, embarrassed us around the world, not worthy, not worthy to hold that office,"" Biden said. ""If we were six months out, we should be moving everything to get him out of office, impeaching him again, trying to invoke the 25th Amendment whatever it took to get him out of office. But I am focused now on us taking control as president and vice president on the 20th and to get our agenda moving as quickly as we can,"" Biden said. Asked about Trump not attending the inauguration, Biden said this was one of the few things that the two had ever agreed on. ""It's a good thing him not showing up,"" Biden told reporters. The president-elect, however, said outgoing Vice President Mike Pence was welcome to attend the inauguration on January. ""I think it is important that as much as we can stick to what have been historical precedents of how and the circumstance in which an administration changes should be maintained and so if Mike --if the vice president is welcome to, I would be honoured to have him there and to move forward in the transition,"" Biden said. Responding to a question, Biden said that he has not spoken to Pence. "
"WASHINGTON: Internet giant Google has suspended US-based microblogging platform Parler -- where most of the supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump are shifting their base -- from its app store, citing posts inciting violence and demanding ""robust"" moderation for ""egregious"" content from the social networking service. Simultaneously, Apple also warned Parler on Friday that it will ban the service from its app store if it doesn't start to moderate its content better. The move by the two Silicon Valley companies came the day when Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account due to ""risk of further incitement of violence"". ""In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like spots that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months,â Google said in a statement. ""We recognise that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content,"" it said. ""In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app from the Play Store until it addresses these issues,"" said Google, whose software powers Android phones. Parler has a significant user base of Trump supporters and conservatives. Apple in a statement said it has received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in Parler service, accusations that the app was used to plan, coordinate and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington DC on January 6 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries and the destruction of property. âThe app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities,"" the company said. Parler's CEO John Matze in a post challenged Apple's position. ""Apparently they believe Parler is responsible for ALL user generated content on Parler. By the same logic, Apple must be responsible for ALL actions taken by their phones. Every car bomb, every illegal cell phone conversation, every illegal crime committed on an iPhone, Apple must also be responsible for,"" he said. âWe will not cave to pressure from anti-competitive actors! We will and always have enforced our rules against violence and illegal activity. But we WONT cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!â he said. "
"President Donald Trump lost more than an election last week. When he leaves the White House in January, he will also lose the constitutional protection from prosecution afforded to a sitting president. After Jan 20, Trump, who has refused to concede and is fighting to hold onto his office, will be more vulnerable than ever to a pending grand jury investigation by the Manhattan district attorney into the presidentâs family business and its practices, as well as his taxes. The two-year inquiry, the only known active criminal investigation of Trump, has been stalled since last fall, when the president sued to block a subpoena for his tax returns and other records, a bitter dispute that for the second time is before the US Supreme Court. A ruling is expected soon. Trump has contended that the investigation by the district attorney, Cyrus R Vance Jr, a Democrat, is a politically motivated fishing expedition. But if the Supreme Court rules that Vance is entitled to the records, and he uncovers possible crimes, Trump could face a reckoning with law enforcement â further inflaming political tensions and raising the startling specter of a criminal conviction, or even prison, for a former president. âHeâll never have more protection from Vance than he has right now,â said Stephen I Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas. âVance has been the wild card here,â Vladeck added. âAnd there is very little that even a new administration that wants to let bygones be bygones could do formally to stop him.â A lawyer for the president, Jay Sekulow, declined to comment through a spokesman. The district attorneyâs investigation of a sitting president has taken on even greater significance because Trumpâs past use of his presidential power â pardoning those close to him charged with federal crimes â suggests he will make liberal use of the pardon pen on behalf of associates, family members and possibly even himself, as he claimed he has the right to do. But his pardon power does not extend to state crimes, like the possible violations under investigation by Vanceâs office. Vanceâs inquiry could take on outsized importance if the incoming Biden administration, in seeking to unify the country and avoid the appearance of retaliation against Trump, shies away from new federal investigations. Such a move would not bind the district attorney, an independent elected state official. Vanceâs lawyers acknowledged during the court fight over the subpoena that the Constitution bars them from prosecuting a president while in office, but the district attorney has said nothing about what might happen once Trump leaves the White House. Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, declined to comment. It remains unclear whether the office will determine that crimes were committed and choose to prosecute Trump or anyone in his orbit. Vanceâs actions in the coming months are likely to put him under increasing political scrutiny. Trump will leave the White House amid calls for him to face criminal charges and a drumbeat of strident criticism from the left that he has evaded any legal consequences for his conduct over the years. On the one hand, Vance could face pressure to forsake any charges to allow the country to move forward after a contentious presidential election. On the other, the district attorney was sharply criticized for his 2012 decision not to seek an indictment against Trumpâs children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., after they were accused of misleading investors in a condo-hotel project. Vance has said that after a two-year investigation, his office could not prove a crime was committed. Some legal experts said it would send the wrong message if Vance had evidence to justify charges but decided to walk away from a prosecution of Trump. âThat would put the president above the law,â said Anne Milgram, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan and Democratic attorney general in New Jersey and a frequent critic of Trump. And because Trump has repeatedly complained that the investigation was part of a broad partisan witch hunt, any decision to end it once the president left office could be seen as a tacit acknowledgment that such criticism was justified. Few facts have been publicly disclosed about the course of the district attorneyâs investigation or the people or potential crimes being examined because the inquiry is shielded by grand jury secrecy. But during the legal battle over Vanceâs subpoena, which sought eight years of Trumpâs personal and corporate tax returns and other records from his accounting firm, prosecutors suggested in court papers that they were investigating a range of potential financial crimes. They include insurance fraud and criminal tax evasion, as well as grand larceny and scheming to defraud â which together are New York state's equivalent of federal bank fraud charges. And prosecutors argued in court that the documents they had demanded from the accounting firm, Mazars USA, represented âcentral evidenceâ for their investigation. But they have provided little in the way of specifics beyond citing multiple news reports that detailed a range of potential criminal conduct by the president and his associates, including a series of 2018 New York Times articles that outlined possible tax crimes committed by Trump based on a detailed analysis of some of his tax return data obtained by the newspaper. Trump, before and during his presidency, declined to publicly release his tax returns, breaking with 40 years of White House tradition, and he vigorously fought attempts by Congress and state lawmakers to obtain them. The district attorneyâs inquiry, which began in the summer of 2018, was first thought to focus on hush money payments made on behalf of Trump just days before the 2016 presidential election to an adult film star who had claimed she had an affair with him. But the subpoena for Trumpâs tax returns underscores an apparent greater focus on potential tax crimes, which tax experts, former prosecutors and defense lawyers agree can be among the toughest cases for the government to win at trial. âThe burden of proof is substantial,â said William J. Comiskey, a former longtime state prosecutor of white-collar and organized crime cases who later oversaw enforcement at New Yorkâs Department of Taxation and Finance. That, in large measure, is because prosecutors must prove that the defendant actually intended to evade taxes, Comiskey said. And tax cases can be boring for jurors. âThey involve a complicated set of rules and numbers, and itâs hard for jurors â or anyone â to keep their focus through days and days of testimony,â said Amy Walsh, who handled tax cases as a federal prosecutor and later as a defense lawyer at a firm that specialized in tax matters. The challenge in presenting such cases to a jury is compounded without a cooperating witness who can serve as a guide through complex financial strategies and records, or emails or other statements containing admissions, experts said. âThey need a smoking gun or they need someone to flip,â said Daniel J. Horwitz, who brought tax and complex fraud cases during more than eight years in the Manhattan district attorneyâs office and is now a white-collar defense lawyer. It is unknown whether Vanceâs prosecutors have obtained the cooperation of any insiders for their investigation, but another consequence of Trumpâs departure from office and loss of the power of the presidency could be that it would be easier for them to do so. In addition to Vanceâs inquiry, Trump also faces continuing scrutiny by New York stateâs attorney general â who he has also claimed has targeted him out of partisan rancor. In his lawsuit seeking to block the grand jury subpoena, Trumpâs lawyers quoted 2018 campaign statements by Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, saying they were part of a âcampaign to harass the president.â They cited one statement, for example, in which she said Trump should worry because âweâre all closing in on him.â Last year, Jamesâ office opened a civil fraud investigation into Trumpâs businesses. As recently as last month, Trumpâs son Eric, after months of delays, was questioned under oath by the officeâs lawyers. Rebecca Roiphe, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who teaches legal ethics and criminal law at New York Law School, said Jamesâ earlier statements made it appear there was some truth to the accusation that people who were investigating Trump were âat least capitalizing on that from a political perspective.â The only way for Vance to avoid that perception, Roiphe said, was âto have a rock-solid case with overwhelming evidence, which will help convince the public that theyâre holding the former president accountable for criminal acts.â James, in response to criticism from Trump last year, tweeted that her office âwill follow the facts of any case, wherever they lead.â She added: âMake no mistake: No one is above the law, not even the President.â One thing seems likely: Defending against a white-collar investigation, even as a former president, will be challenging, stressful and disruptive for Trump, said Daniel R. Alonso, who was Vanceâs top deputy from 2010 to 2014 and is now in private practice. âThere are subpoenas and seizures and documents all over the place, as well as constant meetings with lawyers,â Alonso said, adding, âIt would certainly not be pleasant for him.â "
"SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter Inc on Friday deleted new tweets posted by US President Donald Trump on official government account @POTUS and suspended the account of his presidential campaign, after booting his personal account off the platform permanently. Trump tweeted ""We will not be SILENCED!"" from the @POTUS government account, with 33.4 million followers. Twitter had permanently suspended the president's go-to megaphone, his @realDonaldTrump personal account, hours earlier. The company said accounts used by Trump to try to get around the ban could face permanent suspension as well under its ""ban evasion"" policies. ""Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH,"" Trump wrote in the now-deleted tweets, adding that he is considering building his own social media platform in the near future. Twitter shut down his @TeamTrump campaign account shortly after it sent out a tweet with a ""statement from President Trump"" accusing Twitter of ""banning free speech"" and coordinating with ""the Democrats and the Radical Left"" to silence him. The account shortly before that had pointed its 2.3 million followers to its account on Parler, which is popular with conservatives for its hands-off approach to content moderation. Alphabet Inc's Google suspended Parler on Friday, citing posts inciting violence, while Apple Inc gave the service 24 hours to submit a detailed moderation plan. It was the first time Twitter has banned a head of state, the company confirmed. Social media companies have moved swiftly to crack down on Trump and some of his prominent right-wing allies and supporters in the wake of the turmoil in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, which led to five deaths. Trump has repeatedly used Twitter and other platforms to claim his defeat in the Nov. 3 election was due to widespread voter fraud and to share other conspiracy theories, and had urged supporters to come to Washington on Wednesday and march on the Capitol to protest the election result. Facebook Inc said earlier this week it was suspending his account through until at least the end of his presidential term. The Republican president is due to hand over to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden on January 20. In a blog post on Friday, Twitter said that two of the president's tweets posted that day were in violation of its policy against the glorification of violence. Twitter had temporarily blocked Trump's account on Wednesday following the siege of Capitol Hill, and warned that additional violations by the president's accounts would result in a permanent suspension. Trump was required to delete three rule-breaking tweets before his account was unblocked. He returned to Twitter on Thursday with a video acknowledging that Biden would be the next US president. Twitter said that Trump's tweet that he would not be attending Biden's inauguration was being received by a number of his supporters as confirmation that the November election was not legitimate. It said another tweet praising ""American Patriots"" and saying his supporters ""will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!"" could be seen as ""further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an orderly transition."" Critics of major social media platforms, including top Democratic politicians, praised Twitter's move and said it was long overdue, while Trump suppporters expressed outrage. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, in a tweet on Friday decried the ban, saying dictators who had threatened genocide continued to have Twitter accounts. He did not provide names. The White House had no immediate direct comment. The Trump campaign's Twitter account criticized the company for ""silencing"" the president of the United States. 'LOOTING AND SHOOTING'Trump's prolific use of social media helped propel him to the White House in 2016. He has used his personal @realDonaldTrump account, which has sometimes tweeted more than 100 times a day, to reach supporters, spread misinformation and even fire staff. In a 2017 interview on Fox Business, Trump said ""I doubt I would be here if it werenât for social media, to be honest with you,"" according to a transcript released by the network. Both Twitter and Facebook have long afforded Trump special privileges as a world leader, saying that tweets that may violate the company's policies would not be removed because they were in the public interest. They said he would lose access to those privileges upon leaving office, however. Twitter last year started labeling and putting warnings on Trump's tweets that broke its rules against glorifying violence, manipulated media or sharing potentially misleading information about voting processes. "
"Law enforcement authorities and the FBI began identifying Trump's stormtroopers- described as ""patriots"" by Trump family members and ""terrorists"" by critics- on the basis of photos and video footage, including many in which they boasted about storming the Capitol. More than 60 people have been arrested so far. Many face the prospect of prosecution and ten years in prison thanks to an executive order signed by Trump that was ironically aimed at ""radical left"" protestors accused of damaging federal property. Even more serious charges are in the offing, including possible terrorism charges. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information about pipe bombs left outside Republican and Democratic offices. Separately, DC Police is offering $1,000 rewards for information about members of the mob. Many political stalwarts and law enforcement people are characterising the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters as tantamount to a terrorist attack. ""They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It's that basic. It's that simple,"" President-elect Biden said during an event in Wilmington, Delaware, to introduce his nominees to lead the Justice Department, among them Indian-American Vanita Gupta, a civil rights attorney nominated to be the associate attorney general. But Trump and his minions, including some in the extreme right media, are continuing to defend the MAGA mob, some of whom bragged about defecating in the halls of Congress. While calling out Trump for recklessly encouraging his supporters to march to the US Capitol, Fox News host Tucker Carlson maintained it was simply a ""political protest"" that ""got out of hand""- even though bombs were found at the Republican and Democratic headquarters. Also defending the MAGA mob was conservative radio talk show host and Trump supporter Rush Limbaugh who compared the rioters to revolutionaries while plying the discredited extreme right wing conspiracy theory that the march was infiltrated by Antifa and BLM activists. ""There's a lot of people calling for the end of violence. There's a lot of conservatives, social media, who say that any violence or aggression at all is unacceptable. Regardless of the circumstances,"" he said, invoking the country's Founding Father's to add, ""I'm glad Sam Adams, Thomas Paine, the actual tea party guys, the men at Lexington and Concord didn't feel that way."" "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said on Friday he won't attend President-elect Joe Biden's Inauguration on January 20. He will be the first incumbent President since Andrew Johnson to skip his successor's inauguration.

""A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20,"" Trump said in the video. "
"WASHINGTON: Democrats are discussing Friday whether to move forward with the quick impeachment of President Donald Trump if his Cabinet doesn't try to remove him first, moving swiftly two days after the Capitol was ransacked by a pro-Trump mob. House Democrats are set to hold a caucus meeting at noon, the first since Wednesday's harrowing events at the Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi discussed the prospect of impeachment with her leadership team Thursday night, hours after announcing that the House was willing to act if Vice President Mike Pence and other officials did not invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment - the forceful removal of Trump from power by his own Cabinet. Though Trump has less than two weeks in office, lawmakers and even some in his administration began discussing options for his removal Wednesday afternoon as Trump first encouraged the crowd to march on the Capitol, then refused to forcefully condemn the violent assault and appeared to excuse it. Rep. Katherine Clark, a member of House Democratic leadership, said procedural moves could allow them to move far quicker than they did on Trump's impeachment last year. ""I can confirm that we have had discussions about it and I would hope that the speaker would move forward if the vice president refuses to do what he is required to do under the Constitution,"" said Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, on CNN. ""Everyone knows that this president is deranged."" Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have called for Trump's Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to force Trump from office before President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20. Schumer said he and Pelosi tried to call Pence early Thursday to discuss that option but were unable to connect with him. Pelosi during a new conference Thursday challenged several Cabinet members by name, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. ""Do they stand by these actions?"" Pelosi asked. ""Are they ready to say that for the next 13 days this dangerous man can do further harm to our country?"" Most Democrats, and many Republicans, put the blame squarely on Trump after hundreds of protesters bearing Trump flags and clothing broke into the Capitol on Wednesday and caused destruction and mass evacuations. The president had urged his supporters to protest as Congress was counting the electoral votes that confirmed Joe Biden's win. Pelosi said ""a threshold was crossed of such magnitude"" that Trump should not be allowed to make any decisions. Three Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee began Thursday to circulate articles of impeachment. Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Ted Lieu of California wrote in the articles that Trump ""willfully made statements that encouraged - and foreseeably resulted in _ imminent lawless action at the Capitol."" The House impeached Trump in 2019, but the Republican-led Senate acquitted him in early 2020. Pence has not publicly addressed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, but that possibility may have faded after two Cabinet members resigned Thursday in protest after Trump egged on protesters who then mounted the deadly assault on the Capitol. Yet senior Trump administration officials did raise the long-shot possibility as the chaos unfolded at the Capitol. Officials across the government went so far as to study up on the procedures for declaring Trump ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" No member of the Cabinet has publicly expressed support for the move, which would make Pence the acting president. But several were believed to be sympathetic to the notion, believing Trump is too volatile in his waning days before Biden's inauguration on January 20. Under the 25th Amendment, Trump could dispute his Cabinet's finding, but the Cabinet could quickly reaffirm its position, keeping Pence in power while the question fell to lawmakers. While the House could quickly vote to impeach Trump, it is extremely unlikely that Congress could remove the president in the next 13 days. The Senate would have to receive the articles and then hold a trial and vote on them. And even if it did so, the Republican Senate would be unlikely to vote to convict. Democrats are set to narrowly take the Senate when Biden is inaugurated, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell holds the gavel until then. But in one measure of the uncomfortable position that Trump's goading of the mob had placed Republican lawmakers, there was a noteworthy lack of GOP statements attacking Democrats' calls for his removal. Biden distanced himself from his fellow Democrats' push to oust Trump with the 25th Amendment. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the president-elect, said Biden was focused on taking office on January 20 ""and will leave it to Vice President Pence, the Cabinet and the Congress to act as they see fit.""

"ROME: Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi bemoaned on Friday the ""ugly ending"" to Donald Trump's time at the White House. Berlusconi said ""it would be unjust and uncharitable"" to deny Trump's achievements as US President, notably on the economy and on foreign policy. However, Monday's mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol ""overshadows those achievements and will darken the historical memory of this presidency,"" Berlusconi said in a letter to Italian daily Il Giornale. Berlusconi, 84, is a former real estate and media mogul who reinvented himself as a conservative politician, serving three times as Prime Minister. His career path is often seen as a trailblazing model for Trump's. The scenes in Washington, which left a police officer and four protesters dead, have also been condemned by Matteo Salvini of the hard-right League party, an outspoken backer of Trump. ""Violence is never a solution, never. Long live Freedom and Democracy, always and everywhere,"" Salvini tweeted, without explicitly criticising the outgoing US leader. "
"The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information on who placed pipe bombs in the committee headquarters of US political parties in Washington. Law enforcement agencies had received reports of two suspected devices, one each at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday, the FBI said in a statement. The statement was accompanied by an image of a masked suspect wearing gloves and a hoodie, carrying an object. ""The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the location, arrest and conviction,"" it said. ABC News reported that bomb technicians used water cannon to blast the devices to break them apart and render them harmless on Wednesday just as supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump stormed into the Capitol building, where lawmakers were certifying the victory of President-elect Joe Biden. Trump initially praised his supporters but later condemned the violence. Senators and Congressmen were forced to evacuate after the Trump supporters smashed windows and engaged in looting. The violence, which killed five people, followed a rally at which Trump exhorted supporters to fight to overturn the result of the Nov. 3 election. "
"WASHINGTON: Some of the rioters who stormed the US Capitol were fired from their jobs on Thursday after internet sleuths publicized their identities. The District of Columbia police department released photos of people in Wednesday's melee and potential charges against them. Some 68 people were arrested after angry protesters stormed the building, breaking windows, damaging fixtures and stealing furnishings. The FBI also asked the public to help it identify rioters, a call that drew ribbing on social media in light of the prolific coverage of the event. This included selfies posted by participants and videos of President Donald Trump's supporters at area hotels before the attack. Some individuals who had previously been photographed at Trump rallies and supporters of the QAnon conspiracy-theory movement were quickly identified. Online detectives focused their efforts on others. ""Let's name and shame them!,"" read one Twitter thread devoted to outing participants. One of the people shown in the DC police photos wore his work identification badge inside the capitol and was identified and fired by his employer, Navistar Direct Marketing of Fredrick, Maryland. ""While we support all employees' right to peaceful, lawful exercise of free speech, any employee demonstrating dangerous conduct that endangers the health and safety of others will no longer have an employment opportunity with Navistar Direct Marketing,"" the company said in a statement, without naming the man. Libby Andrews, a real estate agent from Chicago, was fired by @properties and removed from its website, even though she had done nothing wrong and had not entered the capitol, she said in an interview. ""I'm a 56-year-old woman, petite. I was not there causing trouble. I was there to support my president,"" said Andrews. Andrews said she had climbed the steps of the Capitol without encountering security, posted selfies from the scene on Instagram, sang the national anthem and then moved on. Online critics were quick to post negative reviews of her real estate work on a ratings site. Rick Saccone, an adjunct professor at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, resigned after the college reviewed a video he posted on Facebook from the scene. ""As a result of that investigation, Dr. Saccone has submitted and we have accepted his letter of resignation, effective immediately,"" the college said in a statement. Saccone, reached by phone, confirmed his resignation and said he did not see acts of violence and never crossed the threshold of the capitol. Saccone said he deleted the video, which could not be viewed on Thursday. Paul Davis, a lawyer at Westlake, Texas-based Goosehead Insurance, used a social media account to broadcast his participation at the capitol, saying that he had been teargassed. A Goosehead spokesperson confirmed Davis had been fired. "
"UNITED NATIONS: China on Thursday warned the United States would pay a ""heavy price"" if its United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft made good on plans to travel to Taiwan next week. Democratic and self-ruled Taiwan lives under the constant threat of invasion by authoritarian China, which views the island as its own territory and has vowed to seize it one day, by force if necessary. Beijing opposes any diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and has pushed to keep it isolated on the world stage. Outgoing US President Donald Trump has sent multiple senior officials to Taipei over the last year as he clashed with China on a host of issues such as trade, security and human rights. Craft's January 13-15 visit will come just a week before the inauguration of US President-elect Joe Biden and creates a fresh diplomatic headache for the incoming administration. ""The United States will pay a heavy price for its wrong action,"" a statement from the Chinese mission to the UN said in response to the planned trip next week by Craft. ""China strongly urges the United States to stop its crazy provocation, stop creating new difficulties for China-US relations and the two countries' cooperation in the United Nations, and stop going further on the wrong path."" The American UN mission said Thursday evening that Craft would meet with Taiwanese officials and other members of the diplomatic community. ""During her trip, the Ambassador will reinforce the US government's strong and ongoing support for Taiwan's international space,"" the American statement said. She is scheduled to speak at the Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs on January 14, ""on Taiwan's impressive contributions to the global community and the importance of Taiwan's meaningful and expanded participation in international organizations,"" according to the statement. Taiwanese presidential spokesman Xavier Chang welcomed the visit, saying it ""symbolizes the firm friendship between Taiwan and the US"". Washington diplomatically recognizes Beijing over Taipei, but remains a staunch ally of the latter and is bound by Congress to sell weapons to Taiwan to defend itself. It opposes any move to change Taiwan's current status by force. Senior US officials have made visits to Taiwan before but they became more common and prominent under Trump. Last year three prominent trips were made, including by health secretary Alex Azar, the first by a cabinet official. During that visit China sent fighter jets across the Median Line - a de facto border that runs down the Taiwan Strait. Beijing has piled military, economic and diplomatic pressure on Taipei since Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen's election in 2016, in part due to her refusal to acknowledge its stance that the island is part of ""one China"". Tsai, who won a landslide re-election last year, regards the island as de facto sovereign. China's sabre-rattling reached new peaks last year with Taiwan responding to a record 380 incursions into its defense zone. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has suggested to aides he wants to pardon himself in the final days of his presidency, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, a move that would mark one of the most extraordinary and untested uses of presidential power in American history. In several conversations since Election Day, Trump has told advisers that he is considering giving himself a pardon and, in other instances, asked whether he should and what the effect would be on him legally and politically, according to the two people. It was not clear whether he had broached the topic since he incited his supporters on Wednesday to march on the Capitol, where some stormed the building in a mob attack. Trump acknowledges Biden victory a day after Capitol chaosTrump has shown signs that his level of interest in pardoning himself goes beyond idle musings. He has long maintained he has the power to pardon himself and his polling of aidesâ views is typically a sign that he is preparing to follow through on his aims. He has also become increasingly convinced that his perceived enemies will use the levers of law enforcement to target him after he leaves office. No president has pardoned himself, so the legitimacy of prospective self-clemency has never been tested in the justice system and legal scholars are divided about whether the courts would recognize it. But they agree a presidential self-pardon could create a dangerous new precedent for presidents to unilaterally declare they are above the law and to insulate themselves from being held accountable for any crimes they committed in office. A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Biden blames Trump for violence at Capitol that's shaken USTrump has considered a range of pre-emptive pardons for family, including his three oldest children â Donald Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump â Ivanka Trumpâs husband, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, and for close associates like the presidentâs personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Trump has expressed concerns to advisers that a Biden Justice Department might investigate all of them. Trump, who has told advisers how much he likes having the power to issue clemency, has for weeks solicited aides and allies for suggestions on whom to pardon. He has also offered pre-emptive pardons to advisers and administration officials. Many were taken aback because they did not believe they were in legal jeopardy and thought that accepting his offer would be seen as an admission of guilt, according to the two people. Presidential pardons apply only to federal law and provide no protection against state crimes. They would not apply to charges that could be brought by prosecutors in Manhattan investigating the Trump Organizationâs finances. The discussions between Trump and his aides about a self-pardon came before his pressure over the weekend on Georgia officials to help him try to overturn the election results or his incitement of the riots at the Capitol. Trump allies believe that both episodes increased Trumpâs criminal exposure, and more potential problems emerged for the president on Thursday when the Justice Department said it would not rule out pursuing charges against him over his role in inciting Wednesdayâs violence. Trump returns to Twitter, but remains blocked on Facebook, InstagramâWe are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the building,â said Michael R. Sherwin, the top federal prosecutor in Washington. As aides urged Trump to issue a strong condemnation on Wednesday and he rejected that advice, the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, warned Trump that he could face legal exposure for the riot given that he had urged his supporters to march to the Capitol and âfightâ beforehand, according to people briefed on the discussion. Trump had appeared to White House aides to be enjoying watching the scenes play out on television. Beyond that, the extent of Trumpâs criminal exposure is unclear. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, outlined 10 instances in which Trump may have obstructed justice but declined to say whether Trump broke the law, citing legal and factual constraints of prosecuting a sitting president. Former Justice Department officials and legal experts said that several of the acts should be prosecuted. In 2018, federal prosecutors in New York named Trump as a conspirator in an illegal campaign finance scheme. Pardons can be broad or narrowly tailored. White-collar defense lawyers said that Trump would be best served by citing specific crimes if he pardoned himself, but such details could be politically damaging by suggesting that he was acknowledging he had committed those crimes. A self-pardon would complicate the already fraught question for the Biden Justice Department about whether to investigate and ultimately prosecute Trump. Democrats and former Justice Department officials contend that if Trump pardons himself and the Justice Department declines to prosecute Trump, it will send a troubling message to Americans about the rule of law and to future presidents about their ability to flout the law. âThe Biden Justice Department will not want to acquiesce in a Trump self-pardon, which implies that the president is literally above federal law,â said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former top Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration. A self-pardon would align with Trumpâs unprecedented use of the pardon power. The framers of the Constitution gave the president almost total authority to grant clemency for federal crimes, positioning the head of the executive branch as a check on the judicial branch and as someone who could dip into the justice system to show grace and mercy on the downtrodden. But Trump has eschewed the formal Justice Department process set up to ensure pardons are handed out fairly. Instead, he has used his pardon power unlike any other president to help allies, undermine rivals and push his own political agenda. Of the 94 pardons and commutations Trump has granted, 89% were issued to people who had a personal tie to Trump, helped him politically or whose case resonated with him, according to a tabulation by Goldsmith. The only president to receive a pardon was Richard Nixon. A month after Nixon left office, his former vice president, Gerald Ford, pardoned him for all crimes he committed in office. The move was widely criticized at the time as allowing the presidency to hover above the law. Ford supporters later blamed the pardon for his election loss two years later, though ultimately the pardon came to be seen as a move that helped the country move on from Watergate. Trump has maintained throughout his presidency that he has the authority to pardon himself and first discussed the possibility with aides as early as his first year in office. Those discussions began when his campaignâs ties to Russia were being scrutinized and investigators were examining whether he had obstructed justice. Legal scholars are less certain about Trumpâs declaration that he has an âabsolute rightâ to pardon himself. The Justice Department said in a short August 1974 opinion, just four days before Nixon resigned, that âit would seemâ that presidents cannot pardon themselves âunder the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.â But the president is not bound by those opinions, and there is nothing stopping Trump from signing a pardon for himself. The questions would be whether the Justice Department under another president would honor the pardon and set aside any potential prosecution of Trump and, if he were prosecuted, whether the judicial system would ultimately decide whether the pardon insulates Trump from facing charges. âOnly a court can invalidate a self-pardon, and it can only do so if the Biden administration brings a case against Trump,â Goldsmith said. âA Trump self-pardon would thus make it more likely the Biden team prosecutes Trump for crimes committed in office.â Throughout Trumpâs presidency, he and allies have looked to pardons as a way of helping the president protect himself in criminal investigations. During the Russia investigation, Trump and his personal lawyer John M. Dowd dangled pardons to former aides. One, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, flouted a plea deal to work with prosecutors. "
"PARIS: The choreography was unusual: President Emmanuel Macron of France, standing before the Stars and Stripes, declaring in English that âWe believe in the strength of our democracies. We believe in the strength of American democracy.â And so the presidency of Donald Trump draws to a close with a French leader obliged to declare his faith in the resilience of American democracy, a remarkable development. Macronâs wider point was clear enough: The mob of Trump loyalists in Washington attempting to disrupt the peaceful transition of American power also posed a threat to all democracies. The reputation of the United States may be tarnished, but its identification with the global defense of democracy remains singular. So, when an angry horde, incited by Trump himself, was seen taking over the Capitol, defiling its sacred chambers with swaggering contempt as lawmakers gathered to certify President-elect Joe Bidenâs victory, the fragility of freedom felt palpable in Paris and across the world. âA universal idea â that of âone person, one voteâ â is undermined,â Macron said in an address that began in French and ended in English. It was the âtemple of American democracyâ that had been attacked. The institutions of democracy prevailed in the early hours of the following morning, but the images of mob rule in Washington touched a particular nerve in fractured Western societies. They have been confronted with the emergence of an illiberal authoritarian model in Hungary and Poland, and the rise of rightist political forces from Italy to Germany. They have also faced the truculence of leaders like President Vladimir Putin of Russia, who has declared liberalism âobsolete,â or Xi Jinping, Chinaâs top leader, who has offered his countryâs surveillance-state model to the world as he crushed democratic protest in Hong Kong. âFor European societies, these were shattering images,â said Jacques Rupnik, a political scientist. âEven if America was no longer the beacon on a hill, it was still the pillar that sustained European democracy and extended it eastward after the Cold War.â Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she was âangry and sad.â She blamed Trump unequivocally for the storming of the Capitol that left one woman dead. âDoubts about the election outcome were stoked and created the atmosphere that made the events of last night possible,â she said. Germans, for whom the United States was postwar savior, protector and liberal democratic model, have observed Trumpâs attempts to subvert the democratic process and rule of law with particular dismay. Their anxiety has been accentuated in recent years because the fraying of democracy through polarization, violence, social breakdown and economic hardship has not been confined to the United States. The coronavirus pandemic has sharpened anxieties and mistrust of government. In this context, the mob stampeding through the Capitol seemed to reflect disruptive forces lurking in many parts of the Western world. If it could happen at democracyâs heart, it could happen anywhere. Last year, as battles over racial justice raged in several American cities, the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel portrayed Trump in the Oval Office with a lighted match and called him âDer Feuerteufel,â or literally, âThe Fire Devil.â The message was clear: The US president was playing with fire. This could only stir German memories of the Reichstag fire of 1933 that enabled Hitler and the Nazis to scrap the fragile Weimar democracy that brought them to power. Painful memory has not been confined to Germany. Throughout much of Europe â a continent where totalitarian rule is not some distant specter, but something people alive today have lived â Trumpâs attacks on an independent judiciary, a free press and the sanctity of the ballot were long seen as ominous. Merkel herself started life in Communist East Germany. She has watched as the post-1989 euphoria over the inevitability of a free democratic world has evaporated, deflated by the rise of authoritarian governments. Trump, attacking foundations of that world like NATO or the European Union, often appeared to want to tilt the world in the same illiberal direction. He has been defeated. American institutions have withstood the mayhem. Bidenâs victory was duly certified by Congress once order was restored. Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump had tried to enlist in his effort to overturn the November election result, affirmed Biden as the winner. Trump issued a statement saying, for the first time, that there will be âan orderly transition on January 20th.â Two victories in Senate races in Georgia ensured that Democrats will control the Senate, a stinging final rebuke to Trump that opens the way for the new president to pursue his agenda. So, all is well after all? Not really. The American idea and American values â democracy, the rule of law, the defense of human rights â have suffered a sustained assault during Trumpâs presidency. Rupnik suggested it would be âvery difficultâ for Biden to project America as âthe convener of a community of democracies,â an idea the incoming administration has aired to signal a return to Americaâs core principles. For some time, the rest of the world will look on the United States with skepticism when it seeks to promote democratic values. The images of the overrun Capitol will be there, for those who want to use them, to make the point that America would be best advised to avoid giving lessons in the exercise of freedom. Dictators of the hard and soft variety have new and potent ammunition. âDemocracy Fractured,â was the banner headline in the French daily Le Figaro, above a photograph of the Capitol under siege. An editorial suggested that Trump might have left office with âa contested but not negligible balance sheet.â Instead, âhis narcissism having overcome any dignity, he manhandled institutions, trampled on democracy, divided his own camp and ends his presidency in a ditch.â There were signs that Trumpâs magnetism is already ebbing. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis, a supporter of Trump, promptly changed his Twitter profile picture from one showing him wearing a MAGA-style red baseball cap with the words âSilnÃ© Ceskoâ (Strong Czech Republic), to one that shows him wearing a face mask with the Czech flag. The Washington turmoil illustrated in the end that the United States is bigger than one man, a point Macron seemed intent on making. He alluded to joint American and French support for freedom and democracy since the 18th century. He mentioned Alexis de Tocquevilleâs praise of American democracy. He spoke of American defense of French freedom during two World Wars. Macronâs message seemed clear. The America of âWe the People,â the America that held it self-evident at its creation that âall men are created equal,â was still needed, and urgently, for âour common struggle to ensure that our democracies emerge from this moment that we are all living through even stronger.â "
"WASHINGTON: Golf greats Gary Player and Annika Sorenstam accepted the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump in a closed-door ceremony on Thursday, a day after a mob of Trump supporters invaded the US Capitol building. Trump also bestowed the award, America's highest civilian honor, posthumously on Olympic gold medallist and women's golf pioneer Babe Didrikson Zaharias. Thursday's ceremony at the White House came a day after chaos erupted in the US capital, when a ragtag group egged on by Trump breached Capitol security and temporarily brought a halt to Congress's confirmation of Joe Biden's victory in the November presidential election. Biden's victory was later confirmed by legislators and with Trump under fire for stoking the incident the award ceremony was held without the usual fanfare. ""Today, President Donald J. Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously to Babe Zaharias,"" the White House said in a press release. ""The President also presented the award to previously announced recipients Annika Sorenstam and Gary J. Player."" South Africa's Player, 85, is one of just five players to complete a career Grand Slam, capturing all four of golf's modern major titles. In all he won nine majors and 24 US PGA Tour titles. Sweden's Sorenstam, 50, won 72 LPGA tour titles, including 10 majors. Her dominant career also included a magical round of 59 in a professional tournament and an appearance in the PGA Tour's Colonial in 2003, where her determination to take on the men sparked debate and raised the profile of women's golf. Zaharias was the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event, in 1935, and remains the only woman to make the cut in a PGA Tour event. Her groundbreaking professional golf career came after an outstanding amateur sports career. Her childhood prowess in baseball earned Zaharias, christened Mildred, the nickname ""Babe"" after Babe Ruth. She excelled in swimming and basketball and at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics set world records in the 80m hurdles, javelin, and high jump on the way to two gold medals and one silver. She pursued golf after her Olympic success, and her swaggering style and athleticism gave her 41 professional wins, with 10 victories prior to the founding of the LPGA in 1950. Her 36 professional titles on the LPGA Tour included 10 major championships. Zaharias was just 45 when she died of cancer in 1956. ""Her towering legacy will shine forever in the history of American athletics,"" the White House said in a statement. "
"NEW YORK: An Indian flag was seen amid a sea of American and Trump flags in a footage, as well as images, of the violent protests at the US Capitol that went viral on social media. An Indian-American Republican political activist, Vincent Xavier, tweeted on Thursday pictures of the flags India, South Korea and Iran at the protest. The Iranian flag was from the pre-Islamic revolution era. His tweet said: ""American patriots - Vietnamese, Indian, Korean & Iranian origins, & from so many other nations & races, who believe massive voter fraud has happened joined rally yesterday in solidarity with Trump. Peaceful protestors who were exercising our rights."" On his Facebook page, Xavier posted a video of a person at the protest with an Indian flag. Many people who commented on the post criticised him for associating India and Indians with a protest that turned violent. One of the posts said: ""It is your right to protest at Trump Rallies, You have no right to carry an Indian flag at Stop the Steal Trump rally which ended in Storming the US Capitol."" Another picture from a Twitter user showed six people standing in front of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) headquarters as if posing for a picture with one of them holding what appeared to be a furled Indian flag on a pole. Another person in the group held a sign that said ""Indian Voices for Trump"", and others had an American and a red Trump flag and signs that said ""Asian Pacific Americans for Trump"" and ""Stop the Steal"" -- a reference to the President's claims about election fraud. The people seemed like they could be of Indian descent and some appeared to be in their 20s or 30s. They could not be identified nor could it be ascertained if they even participated in the protest. There was no indication on the website of Indian Voices for Trump that it backed the protests. The organisation had campaigned for Trump in the run-up to the election. An Indian-origin journalist who works for a public radio station tweeted about the protest participation: ""Lest you think this was an all-white mob, there are Indian-American supporters of the president who took part like my source Hemant, a businessman from Iselin, New Jersey. He sounded ecstatic about today's events."" The journalist also posted a screenshot of an exchange with the person identified only as Hemant in which he said: ""I am here. Thousands and thousands of people are here. They stormed the Capitol building. I witnessed..."" The Indian flag first surfaced in a video posted by the Alejandro Alvarez, the digital editor of the Washington news radio station WTOP and was only seen among the crowd standing back from the Capitol on the street while much further ahead some people were climbing on the building's steps. The person holding the flag could not be seen in the video. An Indian-American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) poll published in October 2020 showed that 22 per cent of registered voters from the community planned to vote for Trump, while 72 per cent were for Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. Going by the IAAS poll, the backing for Trump had increased by 6 per cent compared to his support level shown in the 2016 Post-Election National Asian American Survey. "
"NEW DELHI: President of the United States of America (USA) Donald Trump conceded to Joe Biden in US Presidential elections a day after his supporters breached the Capitol and ransacked the US Congress. With only 15 days left in his term, President Trump, who now faces the threat of a second impeachment, vowed to ensure""smooth transition"" in a video released on Thursday evening. Trump accepts defeatDonald Trump on Thursday promised a smooth transition to Joe Biden and acknowledged his presidency was ending as calls grew for his removal from office for encouraging a mob attack on the US Capitol. In a video, Trump condemned rioters who rampaged in his name through a congressional session that certified Biden's victory. âNow Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th,â he said in a two-minute video posted on Twitter on Thursday. âMy focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,"" said Trump. Trump's Thursday's statement was in stark contrast to his address on Wednesday. Protesters were urged by Trump during a rally near the White House earlier Wednesday to head to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were scheduled to confirm Biden's presidential victory. The mob swiftly broke through police barriers, smashed windows and paraded through the halls, sending lawmakers into hiding. Biden won seven million votes more than Trump in the November 3 election as well as a decisive edge in the vital state-by-state Electoral College. Trump back on Twitter; Facebook, Instagram suspension continuesSeveral social media platforms blocked Donald Trump's account on Wednesday after his video incited a mob to ransack the Capitol. Twitter unlocked the president's Twitter account, which has 88 million followers after Trump removed three rule-breaking tweets. Facebook and Instagram said they are blocking Trump's social media accounts for the rest of his presidency until the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. YouTube, owned by Google, announced more general changes that will penalize accounts spreading misinformation about voter fraud in the 2020 election, with repeat offenders facing permanent removal. Snapchat on Wednesday locked Trump's account ""indefinitely."" Twitch, the live-streaming site owned by Amazon and used by Trump's campaign to stream speeches, disabled Trump's account until he leaves office. E-commerce company Shopify also shut down two online Trump memorabilia stores for promoting people or organizations ""that threaten or condone violence to further a cause."" It remains unclear how the platforms will handle Trump once he leaves office and is no longer shielded from the enforcement of most rules by his status as a world leader. US Capitol Police chief resigns The violent siege of the Capitol by President Donald Trump's supporters also raised questions on the ability of the police to secure the complex. The rampage that shocked the world forced the resignations of at least two top security officials at the Capitol over the failure to stop the breach. US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund and the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, Michael Stenger were forced to resign. The Sergeant at Arms of the House was also expected to be removed. Sund had defended his department's response to the storming of the Capitol, saying officers had ""acted valiantly when faced with thousands of individuals involved in violent riotous actions."" Sund said that rioters attacked Capitol police and other law enforcement officers with metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants and ""took up other weapons against our officers."" It was ""unlike any I have ever experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, DC,"" said Sund. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called the police response ""a failure."" Lawmakers from both parties pledged to investigate and questioned whether a lack of preparedness allowed a mob to occupy and vandalize the building. Democrats demand Trump leave officeTrumpâs administration plunged deeper into crisis Thursday as more officials resigned in protest, prominent Republicans broke with him, and Democratic congressional leaders threatened to impeach him. Some Republicans joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a cascade of Democrats calling for Trump to be removed from office without waiting until the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. However, the prospect of actually short-circuiting Trumpâs tenure in its last days appeared remote. Despite a rupture with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence privately ruled out invoking the disability clause of the 25th Amendment to sideline the president with some lawmakers concluding that the 25th Amendment was an unwieldy mechanism to remove a president. While an impeachment conviction would only strip Trump of his power days earlier than he is set to lose it anyway, it could also disqualify him from running again in 2024. An isolated Trump lays into PenceUS President Donald Trump has increasingly isolated himself in the White House, relying on a small group of diehard loyalists. US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, on Thursday became the first Trump Cabinet member to quit since the Capitol siege. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos followed her. A source familiar with the matter said it took an intervention by Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump to help persuade him to change his tune a day after the president told supporters who ransacked the Capitol to ""go home, we love you, you're very special."" Trump had initially been reluctant to criticize his supporters at all, the source said. Trump has repeatedly lambasted Pence, publicly and privately, for refusing to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win, and has been seething at Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, for stating that Pence would perform his constitutional duty, the sources said. A Pence adviser said ""everyone around him is very proud of him"" for how he performed his constitutional duty and that he had told Trump ahead of time what he planned to do.

"WASHINGTON: With 13 days left in his term, President Donald Trump finally bent to reality on Thursday amid growing talk of trying to force him out early, acknowledging he'll peacefully leave after Congress affirmed his defeat. Trump led off a video from the White House by condemning the violence carried out in his name a day earlier at the Capitol. Then, for the first time, he admitted that his presidency would soon end - though he declined to mention President-elect Joe Biden by name or explicitly state that he had lost. ""A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20,"" Trump said in the video. ""My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation."" https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1610064624000The address, which appeared designed to stave off talk of a forced early eviction, came at the end of a day when the cornered president stayed out of sight in the White House. Silenced on some of his favorite internet lines of communication, he watched the resignations of several top aides, including a Cabinet secretary. And as officials sifted through the aftermath of the pro-Trump mob's siege of the US Capitol, there was growing discussion of impeaching him a second time or invoking the 25th Amendment to oust him from the Oval Office. Trump returns to Twitter, but remains blocked on Facebook, InstagramThe invasion of the Capitol building, a powerful symbol of the nation's democracy, rattled Republicans and Democrats alike. They struggled with how best to contain the impulses of a president deemed too dangerous to control his own social media accounts but who remains commander in chief of the world's greatest military. ""I'm not worried about the next election, I'm worried about getting through the next 14 days,"" said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump's staunchest allies. He condemned the president's role in Wednesday's riots and said, ""If something else happens, all options would be on the table."" Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that ""the president of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America."" She called him ""a very dangerous person who should not continue in office. This is urgent, an emergency of the highest magnitude."" Neither option to remove Trump seemed likely, with little time left in his term to draft the Cabinet members needed to invoke the amendment or to organize the hearings and trial mandated for an impeachment. But the fact that the dramatic options were even the subject of discussion in Washington's corridors of power served as a warning to Trump. Fears of what a desperate president could do in his final days spread in the nation's capital and beyond, including speculation Trump could incite more violence, make rash appointments, issue ill-conceived pardons - including for himself and his family - or even trigger a destabilizing international incident. The president's video Thursday - which was released upon his return to Twitter after his account was restored - was a complete reversal from the one he put out just 24 hours earlier in which he said to the violent mob, ""We love you. You're very special."" His refusal to condemn the violence sparked a firestorm of criticism and, in the new video, he at last denounced the demonstrators' ""lawlessness and mayhem."" As for his feelings on leaving office, he told the nation that ""serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime"" while hinting at a return to the public arena. He told supporters ""that our incredible journey is only just beginning."" Just a day earlier, Trump unleashed the destructive forces at the Capitol with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally that prompted supporters to disrupt the congressional certification of Biden's victory. After the storming of the Capitol and the eventual wee-hours certification of Biden's win by members of Congress, Trump released a statement that merely acknowledged he would abide by a peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20. The statement was posted by an aide and did not originate from the president's own Twitter account, which has 88 million followers and for four years has been wielded as a political weapon that dictates policy and sows division and conspiracy. Trump couldn't tweet it himself because, for the first time, the social media platform suspended his account, stating that the president had violated its rules of service by inciting violence. Facebook adopted a broader ban, saying Trump's account would be offline until after Biden's inauguration. Deprived of that social media lifeblood, Trump remained silent and ensconced in the executive mansion until Thursday evening. But around him, loyalists headed for the exits, their departures - which were coming in two weeks anyway _ moved up to protest the president's handling of the riot. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao became the first Cabinet member to resign. Chao, married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of the lawmakers trapped at the Capitol on Wednesday, said in a message to staff that the attack ""has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside."" Others who resigned in the wake of the riot: Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger, Ryan Tully, senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council, and first lady Melania Trump's chief of staff Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary. Mick Mulvaney, Trump's former chief of staff-turned-special envoy to Northern Ireland, told CNBC that he had called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""to let him know I was resigning. ... I can't do it. I can't stay."" And Mulvaney said that others who work for Trump had decided to remain in their posts in an effort to provide some sort of guardrails for the president during his final days in office. ""Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they're worried the president might put someone worse in,"" Mulvaney said. Mulvaney's predecessor in the chief of staff job, retired US Marine Corps general John Kelly, told CNN that ""I think the Cabinet should meet and have a discussion"" about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment - allowing the forceful removal of Trump by his own Cabinet. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joined Pelosi in declaring that Trump ""should not hold office one day longer"" and urged Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to act. But Chao's departure may stall nascent efforts to invoke the amendment. Staff-level discussions on the matter took place across multiple departments and even in parts of the White House, according to two people briefed on the talks. But no member of the Cabinet has publicly expressed support for the move - which would make Pence the acting president - though several were believed to be sympathetic to the notion, believing Trump is too volatile in his waning days in office. In the West Wing, shell-shocked aides were packing up, acting on a delayed directive to begin offboarding their posts ahead of the Biden team's arrival. The slowdown before now was due to Trump's single-minded focus on his defeat since Election Day at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office. Most glaringly, that included the fight against the raging coronavirus that is killing record numbers of Americans each day. Few aides had any sense of the president's plans, with some wondering if Trump would largely remain out of sight until he left the White House. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany read a brief statement in which she declared that the Capitol siege was ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way."" But her words carried little weight. Trump has long made clear that only he speaks for his presidency. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump returned to Twitter on Thursday with a video acknowledging that Joe Biden would be the next US president as other social media services including Facebook Inc blocked his accounts over concerns that his messages might spark further violent protests. Twitter unlocked the president's @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, which has 88 million followers, after Trump removed three rule-breaking tweets. His first post back on the platform featured a video in which he said he was focused on a peaceful transition of power and which was viewed 1.4 million times within 15 minutes of posting. https://t.co/csX07ZVWGe— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1610064624000Tech companies have been scrambling to crack down on the president's baseless claims about the Nov. 3 US presidential election after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in unrest that resulted in four deaths. Trump's accounts remain blocked on Facebook and Instagram for at least two weeks and perhaps indefinitely. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that the risks of allowing him to use the platform were ""simply too great."" Facebook's move marked the most significant sanction of the president by a major social media company. Live-streaming platform Twitch and photo-sharing service Snap Inc issued similar bans. ""The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,"" Zuckerberg said in his Facebook post. White House spokesman Judd Deere said in response that the companies had censored the president at a critical time for the country. ""Big Tech is out of control,"" he said. Zuckerberg said the block on Trump's Facebook page, which has 35 million followers, would last at least until Biden takes office on Jan. 20. At an all-hands meeting on Thursday, Zuckerberg told employees he considered it important political leaders ""lead by example and make sure we put the nation first."" ""What we've seen is that the president has been doing the opposite of that and instead fanning the flames of those who think they should turn to violence to overturn the election outcome,"" he said, according to audio of the remarks heard by Reuters. Social media companies have been under pressure to police misinformation about the US election on their platforms, including from the president. Trump and his allies for months have amplified baseless claims of election fraud and the president told protesters to go to Capitol Hill, with both Republicans and Democrats saying he was responsible for the resulting violence. Amazon.com Inc's Twitch disabled Trump's channel due to the ""extraordinary circumstances and the president's incendiary rhetoric,"" it said. A spokeswoman said the company would reassess Trump's account after he leaves office. E-commerce platform Shopify shut service for stores affiliated with Trump for violations of its ""acceptable use"" policy, prompting e-commerce sites for both the campaign and the Trump Organization to go offline. BLOCKS 'LONG OVERDUE' Facebook's decision follows bans in recent years of some government officials in India and Myanmar for promoting violence. A Facebook spokesman said the company had never before blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state. In a video posted to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube on Wednesday, which was later deleted by the platforms after garnering millions of views, Trump repeated election fraud claims as he told protesters to go home. Civil rights groups including Color of Change have called for social media companies to ban Trump permanently from the platforms, where he has repeatedly violated policies. The Anti-Defamation League praised Facebook's move, calling it ""an obvious first step,"" while the NAACP in a statement said the move was a ""long overdue"" gesture that ""rings hollow."" Facebook has drawn criticism for exempting politicians' posts and ads from its third-party fact-checking program and repeatedly said it does not want to be ""the arbiter of truth."" The company has in recent months started labeling some of Trump's statements but faced questions about why it had not acted sooner against violent rhetoric that proliferated in the past few weeks as organizers planned the rally online. Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement he was ""deeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol"" for Facebook to take action and wondered ""if the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress."" Democratic Senator Mark Warner, incoming chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the social media actions did not go far enough. ""These platforms have served as core organizing infrastructure for violent, far right groups and militia movements for several years now â helping them to recruit, organize, coordinate and in many cases (particularly with respect to YouTube) generate profits from their violent, extremist content,"" he said in a statement. YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc's Google, said Thursday any channel that posts videos with false claims about the election results will be temporarily restricted from uploading or live streaming. YouTube did not respond to a question about whether it would ban Trump's account in the same manner as Facebook, while a Twitter spokesman said it was continuing to ""evaluate the situation in real time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter."" He said Twitter would inform the public if an ""escalation"" in its approach was necessary. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump conceded on Thursday that Joe Biden will be the next US president, a day after his supporters stormed the US Capitol as Congress was certifying Biden's victory in a stunning assault on American democracy. Trump, who as recently as Thursday morning had continued to claim falsely that the election had been stolen from him, said his focus would now turn to ensuring a smooth transition to a Biden administration in a video released on Thursday evening. The president condemned Wednesday's violence, saying rioters had defiled the seat of American democracy. ""Serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime,"" Trump said. ""And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning."" The statement was a stark reversal for Trump, who has spent months insisting he prevailed in the Nov. 3 election due to widespread fraud, despite no evidence. His exhortation on Wednesday to thousands of supporters that they should march to the Capitol to protest the election results whipped up a mob that overran police officers and invaded the Capitol building, forcing members of Congress into hiding for their own safety. The top Democrats in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, had called on Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's Cabinet earlier on Thursday to invoke a provision of the U.S. Constitution that allows them to remove the president from power if he is unable to discharge the duties of the office. Barring that, Pelosi said she would likely reconvene the House to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump for his role in Wednesday's violence, which claimed five lives, including that of a Capitol Police officer, according to reports. "
"NEW DELHI: Major social media giants, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, on Thursday banned, restricted or âsuspended indefinitelyâ US President Donald Trump from their platforms following his allegedly provocative posts which led to a violent insurrection at the Capitol Hill. YouTube has also removed several Trump videos. Around 9.30pm IST, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted, âWe believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.â âOver the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech. But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,â Zuckerberg wrote. Twitter also asked for the removal of three of Trump's tweets and banned him from using the platform for 12 hours following their deletion. Snapchat, too, restricted the President from posting to his account indefinitely. One of the tweets, which the microblogging platform took down, contained a video, posted two hours after the siege at the Capitol, which showed Trump asking protesters to go home, but also had him repeat his claims of âfraudulentâ election results. Twitter had initially not taken down the video, but had restricted people from retweeting, liking and commenting on it. âAs a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington DC, we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,â Twitter wrote from a verified handle @twittersafety. It added that âfuture violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.â Trump had been using his social media accounts to challenge the 2020 Presidential election since the declaration of results in early November last year, calling them fraudulent on several occasions. Twitter had flagged several of his tweets, labeling them as âdisputedâ. "
"WASHINGTON: Congress confirmed Democrat Joe Biden as the presidential  winner before dawn Thursday after a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Lawmakers were resolved to complete the Electoral College tally in a display to the country, and the world, of the nation's enduring commitment to uphold the will of the voters and the peaceful transfer of power. They pushed through the night with tensions high and the nation's capital on alert. Shortly before 4 am on Thursday, lawmakers finished their work, confirming Biden won the election. Vice President Mike Pence, presiding over the joint session, announced the tally, 306-232. Trump, who had repeatedly refused to concede the election, said in a statement immediately after the vote that there will be a smooth transition of power on Inauguration Day. âEven though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,'' Trump said in a statement posted to Twitter by an aide. One Republican lawmaker publicly called for invoking the 25th Amendment to force Trump from office before Biden is inaugurated. Others said there must be a review of the US Capitol Police's inability to prevent the breach of the complex by the protesters. "
"WASHINGTON: President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday denounced the rioters who stormed the US Capitol as âdomestic terroristsâ and he blamed President Donald Trump for the violence that has shaken the nation's capital and beyond. The protest by Trump supporters that breached the security of Congress on Wednesday was ânot dissent, was not disorder, was not protest. It was chaos.â Those who massed on Capitol Hill intending to disrupt a joint session of Congress that was certifying Biden's election victory over Trump âweren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob â insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It's that basic,â Biden said. In solemn tones, Biden said the actions Trump has taken to subvert the nation's democratic institutions throughout his presidency led directly to the mayhem in Washington. Pelosi threatens impeachment if cabinet does not remove TrumpâIn the past four years, we've had a president who's made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution, the rule of law clear in everything he has done,â Biden said. ""He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was the culmination of that unrelenting attack.â The mob of hundreds of Trump backers broke into the Capitol and roamed the halls looking for lawmakers, who were forced to halt their deliberations a nd evacuate to safety. The violent protesters were egged on by Trump himself, who has falsely contended that he lost the election due to voter fraud. 4 dead, democracy wounded, as US stumbles out of Trump nightmareTrump's claims have been repeatedly dismissed in the courts, including the Supreme Court, and by state election officials from both parties, and even some in his own administration. But the president has gone to greater and greater lengths to try to overturn the results, culminating this week in efforts by a small group of Republican senators and larger numbers in the House to objects to the congressional certification of the results on Wednesday and the scene of violence at the Capitol. After the disruption, Congress returned to work late Wednesday and affirmed Biden's victory early Thursday. "
"WASHINGTON: Calls for immediately removing Donald Trump from the White House escalated after the defeated and disgraced President rationalized violence he incited in pursuit of a second term and claimed his time in office ""represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history."" While he retained some hard-core support despite the violence he was blamed for unleashing, establishment Republican Party veterans abandoned him in droves amid talk of invoking the 25th amendment to force him out of office. Several White House aides in an already depleted executive office, resigned in protest, including a Deputy National Security Advisor. Nearly 100 Democratic members of Congress have backed calls for Trump's removal from office in the next several days either through the impeachment process (for which there is very little time) or deploying the 25th Amendment, which will require approval of half the Trump cabinet. The problem with the second option is several cabinet members are unconfirmed ""acting"" secretaries and it is unclear if they count. How could Donald Trump be removed from office before his term ends on January 20?""Rather than taking the easy resign route, @VP Pence and the Trump cabinet should invoke the 25th amendment to save our country from this dangerous president,"" Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirano tweeted. Some analysts worried about the dangers an unhinged President could pose while in possession of nuclear codes. ""If Trump can't be trusted to Tweet he can't be trusted with the nuclear codes - he's lost his mind and America needs to get this dangerous, deluded, despicable lunatic out of White House now,"" the commentator Piers Morgan, a former Trump fanboy, wrote. Vice-president Mike Pence himself was reported to be furious with a man to whom he has shown simpering sycophancy after Trump mobs roamed the halls of Congress looking to harm him. ""I've known Mike Pence forever. I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today. He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump)...'"" Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a 34-year veteran of Congress, told a local newspaper. Trump and his sons implicitly threatened Pence's political future if he did not support the defeated President's effort to steal a second term with bogus, falsified, and exaggerated claims of election fraud. Several mainstream Republicans were shocked by Trump's incendiary tactics that ignited the lunatic fringe on the extreme right and brought the dregs of America into the hallowed portals of U.S Congress to desecrate democracy. One vandal came dressed in a Viking outfit and another saw on a lawmaker's chair scratching his genitals in a colorful display of Trump's following. Trump minions tried to portray them as Antifa infiltrators and BLM activists, but they displayed their symbols of racist hate and bigotry with pride while professing loyalty and love to the agent provocateur president who publicly embraced them and offered them his love even after their attack on the Capitol. Police seemed very chummy with the protesters who also seemed to know exactly where to go. ""There is no question that the President formed the mob, the President incited the mob, the President addressed the mob. He lit the flame,"" Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Chair of the House Republican Conference, said. Some lawmakers and commentators called Trump's incitement to violence an attempted ""coup"" and an ""act of terrorism."" "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to salvage a few priority items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that he blew up, pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and new aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic. In a series of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along. Trump's tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended. Trump, who absorbed much political heat for abandoning the talks, is the steward of an economy whose continued recovery may hinge on significant new steps such as pandemic unemployment benefits. His tweets seemed to move the financial markets into positive territory, though it was far from certain whether they would impress voters demanding more relief. He called on Congress to send him a âStand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks (USD 1,200)â â a reference to a preelection batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House. âI am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?â Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday evening. He also urged Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses. The stock market fell precipitously after Trump pulled the plug on the talks but was recovering Wednesday after he floated the idea of piecemeal aid. Trump's decision to scuttle talks between treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi came after the president was briefed on the landscape for the negotiations â and on the blowback that any Pelosi-Mnuchin deal probably would have received from his GOP allies in Congress. âIt became very obvious over the last couple of days that a comprehensive bill was just going to get to a point where it didn't have really much Republican support at all,"" White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday on Fox News. âIt was more of a Democrat-led bill, which would have been problematic, more so in the Senate than in the House."" Pelosi told reporters that âall the president wants is his name on a checkâ for direct aid payments. The unexpected turn could be a blow to Trump's reelection prospects and comes as his administration and campaign are in turmoil. Trump is quarantining in the White House with a case of the coronavirus, and the latest batch of polls shows him significantly behind Democrat Joe Biden with the election four weeks away. Trump's withdrawal from the talks came immediately after he spoke with GOP leaders in Congress. Many Republican senators had signaled they would not be willing to go along with any measure that topped USD 1 trillion, and GOP aides had been privately dismissive of the prospects for a deal. Any Pelosi-sponsored agreement of close to $2 trillion raised the potential of a GOP revolt if such a plan came to a vote. Pelosi and Mnuchin talked briefly on Wednesday morning about the chances for a stand-alone airline rescue, Pelosi spokesperson Drew Hammill tweeted. Pelosi directed Mnuchin to a measure she had attempted to pass on Friday on short notice under fast-track procedures, but only after Democrats made a number of changes Republicans did not like. The talks have been troubled from their start in July and never appeared to close in on an agreement both sides could embrace. Pelosi had been demanding a host of Democratic priorities on food aid, unemployment benefits, help for renters and homeowners, and aid to state and local governments. Republicans charged that she was dragging the talks to deny Trump a political victory before the Nov. 3 election. Early rounds of virus aid passed by overwhelming margins as the economy went into lockdown in March. After that, Trump and many of his GOP allies focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help. Still, the decision to halt negotiations now could be politically perilous. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 11 million jobs that remain lost since the start of the pandemic exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession. The economy has recovered more quickly than most economists had expected, largely because of the aid Congress approved in a USD 2 trillion package in March. The USD 1,200 stimulus checks, supplemental USD 600 unemployment benefits each week and aid to small businesses boosted household incomes and enabled many low-income Americans to pay bills and rent and maintain their overall spending, according to data from Opportunity Insights. But the recovery has slowed, and certain sectors such as restaurants, hotels, theatres and airlines remain in bad shape, shedding jobs and risking permanent realignment. Without more stimulus, economists expect growth will slow significantly in the final three months of the year. âYou're going to see quite a significant drag on growth,â said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. It âwould really risk a double-dip recession.â "
"LONDON: British home secretary Priti Patel on Thursday condemned the ""awful"" scenes of riots on the Capitol Hill in Washington DC and blamed US President Donald Trump for the violence that resulted in four deaths in clashes between protesters and American police. The senior cabinet minister told the BBC that it was the outgoing President's words that fuelled the violence and accused Trump of doing nothing ""de-escalate that"". ""His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong,"" said Patel. ""He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever what we've seen is completely unacceptable,"" she said. Hundreds of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday â where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Biden's election victory â and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC after he made several claims of electoral fraud. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released. On Thursday, a White House spokesperson issued a Twitter statement to say there will be an ""orderly transition"" to Democrat President-elect Joe Biden, whose November 2020 election victory has since been by US lawmakers. ""Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a Twitter statement. UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said there was ""no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power"". The condemnation of the scenes in the US capital was cross-party in the UK, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it was a ""direct attack on democracy"", while Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon called the events ""utterly horrifying"". A friend of President Trump and leader of the Brexit Party which has now transformed to Reform UK, Nigel Farage, also tweeted: ""Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave."" "

"NEW DELHI: Outgoing US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka referred to the angry mob that stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday as ""American Patriots"", triggering a flood of angry reactions on Twitter. In a tweet, which was later deleted, Ivanka urged the ""American Patriots"" to hold back as hundreds of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol and took over the halls of government. ""American Patriots - any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful,"" the President's daughter appealed on Twitter. Her tweet came shortly after Trump made a similar appeal to his supporters, whom he had instigated earlier in the day. Shortly after the tweet, angry reactions started pouring in as several users criticised Ivanka for referring to the rioters as ""patriots"". No. Peaceful protest is patriotic. Violence is unacceptable and must be condemned in the strongest terms. https://t.co/GwngZTqzTH— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) 1609964989000In response to a journalist questioning the use of the term ""patriots"", Ivanka said ""peaceful protest"" is patriotic but violence is unacceptable and must be condemned in the strongest terms. Four people died, including one woman who was shot by a police officer, after an angry mob stormed the US Capitol to interrupt a constitutional process to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the election. "
"BAGHDAD: An arrest warrant was issued on Thursday for outgoing President Donald Trump in connection with the killing of an Iranian general and a powerful Iraqi militia leader last year, Iraq's judiciary said. The warrant was issued by a judge in Baghdad's investigative court tasked with probing the Washington-directed drone strike that killed General Qassim Suleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the court's media office said. They were killed outside the capital's airport last January. Al-Muhandis was the deputy leader of the state-sanctioned popular mobilization forces, an umbrella group composed of an array of militias, including Iran-backed groups, formed to fight the Islamic State group. Suleimani headed the expeditionary Quds force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. The arrest warrant was for a charge of premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty on conviction. It is unlikely to be carried out but symbolic in the waning days of Trump's presidency. The decision to issue the warrant ""was made after the judge recorded the statements of the claimants from the family of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis,"" according to a statement from the supreme judicial council. The investigation into the killings is ongoing, the court said. The killings sparked a diplomatic crisis and strained US-Iraq ties, drawing the ire of Shiite political lawmakers who passed a non-binding resolution to pressure the government to oust foreign troops from the country. Iran-backed groups have since stepped up attacks against the American presence in Iraq, leading to threats by Washington to shutter its Baghdad diplomatic mission. "
"For weeks, President Donald Trump and his supporters had been proclaiming January 6, 2021, as a day of reckoning. A day to gather in Washington to âsave Americaâ and âstop the stealâ of the election he had decisively lost, but which he still maintained â often through a toxic brew of conspiracy theories â that he had won by a landslide. And when that day came, the president rallied thousands of his supporters with an incendiary speech. Then a large mob of those supporters, many waving Trump flags and wearing Trump regalia, violently stormed the Capitol to take over the halls of government and send elected officials into hiding, fearing for their safety. But if the chaos in the Capitol shocked the country, one of the most disturbing aspects of this most disturbing day was that it could be seen coming. The president had all but circled it on the nationâs calendar. Live: Trump 'concedes', pledges orderly transitionâBig protest in DC on January 6th,â Trump tweeted on December 19, just one of several of his tweets promoting the day. âBe there, will be wild!â And his supporters took the president at his word. 1/17Trump supporters storm US Capitol Previous NextShow CaptionsA pro-Trump mob enter the Capitol Building after breaking into it on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Beneath it, dozens of people posted comments that included photographs of the weaponry â including assault rifles â that they said they planned to bring to the rally. There were also comments referring to âoccupyingâ the Capitol and forcing Congress to overturn the November election that Joe Biden had won â and Trump had lost. RenÃ©e DiResta, a researcher who studies online movements at the Stanford Internet Observatory, said that the violent disruption at the Capitol on Wednesday was the result of online movements operating in closed social media networks where claims of voter fraud and a stolen election found oxygen. âThis is a demonstration of the very real-world impact of echo chambers,â DiResta said. The roots of one of the darkest moments in American democracy reached at least as far back as November 4, the day after the presidential election that Trump would decisively lose to Biden. On that day, the first Stop the Steal group was formed on Facebook â and it quickly took off, realizing at one point 100 new members every 10 seconds. The group swelled to 320,000 followers before Facebook shut it down. As hundreds of new Stop the Steal groups continued to pop up, Facebook became more aggressive in shutting them down, prompting some far-right supporters of Trump â including some involved in militias and conspiracy groups â to move to new, less-restrictive social media sites, including Parler and Gab. And it was on these sites that a movement to organize a pro-Trump protest rally in Washington gathered momentum. Several right-wing activists, including Ali Alexander, a Republican operative who was previously known as Ali Akbar, began to emerge as leaders of Stop the Steal. Their conspiracy theories and fact-free claims of electoral fraud closely mirrored the same baseless charges being leveled by Trump. By mid-December, dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump supporters had failed, often miserably. Then, on Dec. 14, Biden secured enough votes in the Electoral College to affirm his victory. The last formality before his inauguration on Jan. 20 was the official count by Congress of electoral votes, a pro forma ceremony of paperwork, to be overseen by Vice President Mike Pence. Alexander and others seized on January 6, urging Trump supporters everywhere to converge on the Capitol as Congress tended to what historically has been a glorified shuffling of papers â if sometimes infused with grace, as when Vice President Al Gore announced, with grace, the names of the winner, George W Bush, and the loser: Al Gore. The moment has traditionally been seen as another reassurance of the transfer of power in the Republic. But Trump and his supporters were publicly framing this yearâs formality as criminal, fraudulent â even treasonous. As his aides and supporters did what they could to forestall the inevitable â a lawsuit by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, a 36-page report alleging election fraud by Trump adviser Peter Navarro â Trump continued tweeting. JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1609355211000See you in Washington, DC, on January 6th. Donât miss it. Information to follow!— Donald J.

StopTheSteal!â That same day, a supporter misspelled the word âcavalryâ in tweeting that âThe calvary is coming, Mr. President!â Trump responded: âA great honor!â The next day, January 2, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 11 other Republican senators joined another Republican, Josh Hawley of Missouri â as well as more than 100 Republican members of the House of Representatives â in vowing to object to the certification of Bidenâs election. By now, the extreme fringes of Trump supporters â including the Proud Boys and other groups known to incite violence, as well as conspiracy groups like QAnon â were exploring what they might do on January 6 in Washington. On dedicated chats in Gab they discussed logistics of where to gather and what streets they would take to the Capitol. The Red-State Secession Facebook page even encouraged its 8,000 followers to share the addresses of âenemies,â including those for federal judges, members of Congress and well-known progressives. A sense of the percolating trouble came with a widely circulated video of a Trump supporter confronting Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a frequent Trump critic, at Salt Lake International Airport as he awaited a flight Tuesday to Washington. When the supporter asked why he hadnât supported the presidentâs claims of electoral fraud, Romney said that he would follow the Constitution. âI wouldnât be surprised if you werenât even voted in legally,â the person said as she followed the senator to the gate. âYouâre a joke, absolute joke, itâs a disgusting shame.â Meanwhile, members of the Red-State Secession Facebook page were conversing in the language of insurrection. Then dawned January 6, the day of reckoning. Thousands gathered in downtown Washington, forming rivers of Trump red that commingled the Trump and American flags. The crowd included between 2,000 and 2,500 members of the Proud Boys, according to Enrique Tarrio, the groupâs chairman. Any hope that Pence would block the congressional confirmation of Bidenâs election â thereby acquiescing to immense pressure being applied by Trump â were dashed before noon. Pence said in a letter that the vice president did not have such power. âThe presidency belongs to the American people, and to them alone,â he wrote. Then, at noon, Trump began to deliver a speech to his excited followers. In the afternoon, Trump would excoriate his vice president for not having âthe courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.â In the hours to come, his supporters, carrying flags and wearing clothes that bore his name, would rush the Capitol in a terrifying swirl of chaos that would force a lockdown and leave one woman shot dead. Among those who swarmed into the Capitol would be well-known QAnon characters and white supremacists. Jake Angeli, a QAnon supporter known for his painted face and horned hat, roamed the Senate floor. Tim Gionet, a neo-Nazi conspiracy theorist known as âBaked Alaska,â would take over a Senate office. But first came the remarks of the president, delivered on the Ellipse, just south of the White House. âWe will never give up,â he said. âWe will never concede. It will never happen. You donât concede when thereâs death involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.â Trump concluded his 70-minute exhortation by encouraging everyone to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to give Republicans at the Capitol âthe kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.â Then the president of the United States returned to the White House, at a safe distance from the mayhem to unfold. "
"WASHINGTON: The chaos in the US Capitol on Wednesday unfolded after President Donald Trump spent weeks whipping up his supporters with false allegations of fraud in the Nov. 3 election, culminating in a call to march to the building that represents US democracy. Trump, who has refused to concede his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, had urged his supporters multiple times to come to Washington for a rally on Wednesday, the day the US House of Representatives and Senate were scheduled to certify the results of the Electoral College. ""Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,"" Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Dec. 20. ""Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"" They turned out in the thousands and heard the president urge them to march on the Capitol building to express their anger at the voting process and to pressure their elected officials to reject the results. ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,"" Trump told the crowd, speaking with the White House as a backdrop. Appearing at what could be his last rally as the sitting president, Trump exhorted his supporters ""to fight."" ""We will never give up, we will never concede,â Trump said, delighting the crowd by calling Democratic victories the product of what he called ""explosions of bullshit."" ""Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!"" people chanted in reply. Trump has sought for weeks to thwart a peaceful transfer of power, aided by groups such as ""Stop the Steal,"" which promoted https://stopthesteal.us the day's protest and peddled false claims about voter fraud on Facebook and other social media. In a statement posted on Twitter by White House spokesman Dan Scavino on Thursday, Trump said there would be an orderly transition of power ""though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election"". But Wednesday's events were the culmination of his efforts to thwart a peaceful transfer. About 50 minutes into the speech, some of his supporters, waving Trump flags, began heading toward Capitol Hill, where unprecedented mayhem ensued. Protesters fought through police barricades, stormed the building and entered lawmakers' chambers. The certification process was stopped and Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress were evacuated. One civilian was shot dead, Washington police said. As night fell, a Capitol official said the building had been cleared, but outside, some way from the grounds, scores of protesters remained, including members of militia and far-right groups. 'I KNOW YOU'RE HURT' Monitoring the scenes of violence on cable news television from the White House, Trump tweeted about an hour after the Capitol was put on lockdown that the protesters should ""remain peaceful."" As criticism mounted that he had incited a riot, he was urged to say more by a Trump stalwart, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, and some of the advisers who remain for his dwindling days in office. Biden had come out forcefully on live television and said the violence was ""not a protest, it's insurrection."" He called on Trump to demand ""an end to this siege."" Eventually, Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter. ""I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election,"" Trump said, repeating familiar falsehoods. ""But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order."" He posted another message that called the mob ""great patriots"" who were reacting to an election victory ""viciously stripped away."" Twitter later hid three tweets and locked Trump's account. Three White House aides resigned after the violence at the Capitol and more were considering resigning before the end of Trump's term. Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Trump's failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude last summer when he threatened arrests and the use of force to break up protests against racial inequality. During the Black Lives Matter protests, Trump discussed using the military in response, and an area near the White House was forcibly cleared for him to stage a photo-op in front of a church, holding a Bible. Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday. ""Todayâs violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump,"" Jim Mattis, a former defense secretary under Trump, said in a statement. Senator Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, called it an ""insurrection incited by the president of the United States."" Weeks have passed since the states completed certifying that Biden won by 306 votes in the Electoral College to Trump's 232, and Trump's extraordinary challenges to the result have failed in courts across the country. Yet Trump's rally speech on Wednesday was filled with grievances and voter fraud allegations that have not been backed up with evidence. He singled out several Republican lawmakers for criticism, including Romney and Representative Liz Cheney, while hailing as heroes those who have sided with him to stop the electoral votes from being certified. Several times he also urged Pence to intervene. But while Trump was still speaking, Pence released a lengthy statement saying he would carry out his constitutional duty to certify the vote. ""It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,â Pence wrote. About an hour later he was being escorted from the chamber as a mob tried to break in. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Thursday there will be an orderly transition when Joe Biden takes office as president in less than two weeks, after Congress certified the Democrat's victory in the Nov. 3 election. ""Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,"" Trump said in a statement posted on Twitter by White House spokesman Dan Scavino. "
"WASHINGTON: Pro-Trump rioters -- who overtook the US Capitol on Wednesday and stormed past police barricades -- vandalised the office of Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives. Pelosi's aides said the mob shattered a big mirror in the office of the 80-year-old top Democrat and took the nameplate from above the door of her office in the highly-secure building. One image captured a Trump supporter sitting with his feet up on the desk of Pelosi, a fierce critic of the President Donald Trump, a Republican. Rioters flipped over tables and tore down photographs from the walls, according to The New York Times. CNN reported earlier that a photo from inside her office suite showed a folder with the words ""we will not back down"" written on it. The folder was found after rioters stormed the US Capitol as members of Congress were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College win. The veteran politician from California was re-elected Speaker on January 3. Pelosi has led her party in the House of Representatives since 2003 and is the only woman to be speaker.  Pelosi struck a defiant tone returning to the House chamber on Wednesday night, saying rioters had failed in their mission and assuring they would face justice. ""To those who strove to tear us from our responsibility, you have failed,"" she said. ""To those who engaged in the gleeful desecration of this, our temple of ... American democracy, justice will be done."" She then assured Americans that the House would continue to be about the people's business, starting tonight with certifying the election of President-elect Joe Biden. ""Despite the shameful actions of today, we still will do so,"" said Pelosi. ""We will be part of a history that shows the world what America is made of."" ""Congress has returned to the Capitol,"" she said. ""We always knew that this responsibility would take us into the night. We will stay as long as it takes,"" Pelosi was quoted as saying by CNN.  Earlier, Pelosi joined Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer in calling on Trump to demand protesters to leave the Capitol. "
"WASHINGTON: Slamming President Donald Trump for inciting violence at the US Capitol, his predecessor Barack Obama has said it is a moment of ""great dishonour and shame"" for the United States. The statement of the former popular president came hours after thousands of pro-Trump rioters on Wednesday stormed the US Capitol, interrupting a joint session of Congress where lawmakers were set to certify President-elect Joe Biden's win. âHistory will rightly remember today's violence at the Capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation. But we'd be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise,â Obama said in a lengthy statement. Hereâs my statement on todayâs violence at the Capitol. https://t.co/jLCKo2D1Ya— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) 1609980960000For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth â that this was not a particularly close election and that President-elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20, he said. ""Their fantasy narrative has spiralled further and further from reality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we're seeing the consequences, whipped up into a violent crescendo,â Obama said. In the November 3 presidential election, Biden, a Democrat won 306 Electoral College votes while Trump, a Republican, mustered only 232 votes. Obama said, âRight now, Republican leaders have a choice made clear in the desecrated chambers of democracy. They can continue down this road and keep stoking the raging fires. Or they can choose reality and take the first steps toward extinguishing the flames. They can choose America."" The former president said he was heartened to see many members of Trump's party speak up forcefully today. âTheir voices add to the examples of Republican state and local election officials in states like Georgia who've refused to be intimidated and have discharged their duties honourably. We need more leaders like these â right now and in the days, weeks, and months ahead as President-elect Biden works to restore a common purpose to our politics. It's up to all of us as Americans, regardless of party, to support him in that goal,â he said. In a separate statement, former US President George W Bush said he and the former First Lady watched the scenes of ""mayhem unfolding at the seat of our nation's government in disbelief and dismay"". âIt is a sickening and heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic â not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behaviour of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,â he said. The violent assault on the Capitol â and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress â was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes. Insurrection could do grave damage to our nation and reputation, Bush said. In the US, he said, it is the fundamental responsibility of every patriotic citizen to support the rule of law. ""To those who are disappointed in the results of the election: Our country is more important than the politics of the moment. Let the officials elected by the people fulfil their duties and represent our voices in peace and safety,"" Bush said. According to former US President Bill Clinton, the ""unprecedented assault on our Capitol, our Constitution, and our country"" was fuelled by more than four years of ""poison politics"" spreading deliberate misinformation, sowing distrust in the system and ""pitting Americans against one another"". ""We must reject today's violence, turn the page and move forward together â honouring our Constitution, remaining committed to a government of the people, by the people, and for the people,â he said. Former Secretary of State and First Lady, Hillary Clinton, said ""domestic terrorists"" attacked a foundation of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of power following free elections. âWe must reestablish the rule of law and hold them accountable. Democracy is fragile. Our leaders must live up to their responsibility to protect it,â she said. Former Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush alleged that Trump provoked the disgusting events at the Capitol. âHe has gone from creating chaos to inciting insurrection. Mr President, accept your defeat, go home to Florida and let our elected officials do their jobs and rebuild confidence in our democracy,â he said. "
"WILMINGTON: President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday denounced the storming of the US Capitol as an ""insurrection"" and demanded President Donald Trump go on television to call an end to the violent ""siege."" ""At this hour, our democracy is under unprecedented assault,"" the veteran Democrat said in Wilmington, after hundreds of Trump supporters protesting his election defeat swarmed the Capitol building and put the nation's lawmakers at risk. ""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to... demand an end to this siege,"" Biden said. ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, the floor of the United States Senate... threatening the safety of duly elected officials? It's not a protest, it's insurrection."" "
"WASHINGTON: Social media giants Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Wednesday have blocked US President Donald Trump from posting on their platforms as rioters attacked the US Capitol and violent protests broke out in Washington DC. While Twitter said Trump's account will be locked until he deletes three tweets. Facebook and Instagram said Trump won't be able to post for 24 hours. Facebook also removed posts, including a video that Trump posted on the platform in support of the mob descending on the US Capitol. ""This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,"" Guy Rosen, Facebook vice president of integrity said in a tweet. A statement put out by Facebook read: ""We've assessed two policy violations against President Trump's Page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time."". Trump's account on Facebook-owned Instagram will also be locked for 24 hours, Instagram head Adam Mosseri confirmed. Facebook removed a one-minute long video posted by Trump after Pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol building where a vote to certify the results of the 2020 election was going on. In the video, Trump could be seen calling on rioters to peacefully ""go home"" and stated falsely that ""we had an election that was stolen from us."" Facebook also removed a text by Trump asking his supporters to ""remember this day forever!"" Twitter has restricted Trump on its platform, locking his account for 12 hours after removing three tweets that the company said were ""severe violations"" of its policies. Twitter and Facebook have labeled several of Trump's tweets in the past but this is the first time that they have gone ahead and removed his tweets and posts. ""Our public interest policy -- which has guided our enforcement action in this area for years -- ends where we believe the risk of harm is higher and/or more severe,"" Twitter said in a tweet. A chaotic and violent scene erupted at the Capitol on Wednesday as supporters of Trump swarmed the building to protest the Electoral College vote, forcing a lockdown and various confrontations with police. One woman protester died at the Capitol after being shot. The House and Senate were less than an hour into debating the first GOP objection to a state that Biden won -- Arizona -- when they were forced to abruptly recess as mostly maskless rioters crowded into the hallways around each chamber, The Hill reported More than a dozen people have been arrested, police said Wednesday evening. Shortly before a 6 p.m. curfew established by Bowser, the House sergeant-at-arms informed lawmakers that the Capitol had been evacuated. Lawmakers in both parties called for the prosecution of rioters who broke into the Capitol and interrupted proceedings. "

"WASHINGTON: Members of President Donald Trump's cabinet on Wednesday discussed the possibility of removing Trump from office after his supporters stormed the Capitol, three US news channels reported. The discussions focused on the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for a president's removal by the vice president and cabinet if he is judged ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."" Invoking it would require Vice President Michael Pence to lead the cabinet in a vote on removing him. CNN quoted unnamed Republican leaders saying the 25th amendment had been discussed, saying they had described Trump as ""out of control."" 1/17Trump supporters storm US Capitol Previous NextShow CaptionsA pro-Trump mob enter the Capitol Building after breaking into it on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.

While only two weeks remain before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, after the attacks on Congress Wednesday Democratic lawmakers called for invoking the 25th Amendment as well. Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Pence urging him to act to remove Trump, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and ""sought to undermine our democracy."" Pointing to a rambling speech Trump gave Wednesday, it said he ""revealed that he is not mentally sound and is still unable to process and accept the results of the 2020 election."" Others blamed Trump for fueling terrorism. ""The President incited a domestic terror attack on the Capitol. He is an imminent threat to our democracy and he needs to be removed from office immediately,"" said Representative Kathleen Rice in a tweet. ""The Cabinet must invoke the 25th Amendment,"" she wrote. The lawmakers' call was echoed by the influential Washington Post. ""Responsibility for this act of sedition lies squarely with the president, who has shown that his continued tenure in office poses a grave threat to US democracy. He should be removed,"" the Post said. ""The president is unfit to remain in office for the next 14 days. Every second he retains the vast powers of the presidency is a threat to public order and national security,"" they said. "
"WASHINGTON: The storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump on Wednesday has prompted calls by some lawmakers to remove him from office before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on January 20. The chaotic scenes unfolded after Republican Trump, who has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, addressed thousands of protesters and repeated unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him. There are two ways to remove a president from office: the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and impeachment followed by a Senate conviction. In either scenario, Vice President Mike Pence would take over until Biden's inauguration. A source familiar with the effort said here have been some preliminary discussions among some Cabinet members and Trump allies about invoking the 25th Amendment. What's the purpose of the 25th Amendment? The 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967 and adopted in the wake of President John F Kennedy's assassination in 1963, deals with presidential succession and disability. Section 4 addresses situations where a president is unable to do the job but does not step down voluntarily. The drafters of the 25th Amendment clearly intended for it to apply when a president is incapacitated by a physical or mental illness, experts say. Some scholars have also argued that it could also apply more broadly to a president who is dangerously unfit for office. For the 25th Amendment to be invoked, Pence and the majority of Trump's Cabinet would need to declare that Trump is unable to perform the duties of the presidency and remove him. Pence would take over, in that scenario. Trump could subsequently declare that he is capable of resuming the job. If Pence and the majority of the Cabinet do not contest Trump's determination, Trump regains power. If they dispute Trump's declaration, the issue would then be decided by Congress, but Pence would continue to act as president until then. A two-thirds majority of both Chambers would be needed to keep Trump sidelined. But the Democratic-controlled House could simply delay voting on the substantive dispute until Trump's term ends, said Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado. Campos said the 25th Amendment would be an appropriate way to remove Trump from office and has the benefit of being quicker than impeachment. ""Pence could instantly become president, whereas impeachment and conviction could take at least a few days,"" Campos said. Can Trump be impeached and removed? Yes. A misconception about âimpeachmentâ is that it refers to the removal of a president from office. In fact, impeachment refers only to the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, bringing charges that a president engaged in a ""high crime or misdemeanor"" - similar to an indictment in a criminal case. If a simple majority of the Houseâs 435 members approves bringing charges, known as âarticles of impeachment,â the process moves to the Senate, the upper chamber, which holds a trial to determine the presidentâs guilt. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict and remove a president. Trump was previously impeached by the Democratic-led US House in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son. Trump was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate in February 2020. What ""high crime and misdemeanor"" could Trump be accused of? Frank Bowman, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Missouri, said Trump ""arguably fomented sedition,"" or an attempted overthrowing of the US government. But Bowman said Trump could also be impeached for a more general offence: disloyalty to the US Constitution and failing to uphold his oath of office. Congress has discretion in defining a high crime and misdemeanor and is not limited to actual criminal offences. ""The essential offence would be one against the Constitution - one of essentially trying to undermine the lawful results of a lawfully conducted election,"" Bowman said. "
"WASHINGTON: Hundreds of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a bid to overturn his election defeat, occupying the symbol of American democracy and forcing Congress to temporarily postpone a session to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory. Police evacuated lawmakers and struggled for more than three hours to clear the Capitol of Trump supporters, who surged through the halls and rummaged through offices in shocking scenes of chaos and mayhem. One woman died after being shot during the mayhem, Washington police said. The FBI said it had disarmed two suspected explosive devices. Police declared the Capitol building secure shortly after 5:30 p.m. (2230 GMT), and lawmakers reconvened shortly after 8 p.m. (0100 GMT on Thursday) to resume the election certification. ""To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today - you did not win,"" Vice President Mike Pence said as the session resumed. ""Let's get back to work,"" he said, drawing applause. ""We will certify the winner of the 2020 election,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell added, calling the assault by Trump supporters a ""failed insurrection."" Lawmakers were debating a last-ditch effort by pro-Trump lawmakers to challenge the results, which was unlikely to succeed. But some who had planned to object said they would cut their effort short and perhaps only challenge the results in one state instead of multiple states. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a citywide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (2300 GMT). National Guard troops, FBI agents and U.S. Secret Service were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police, and Guard troops and police pushed protesters away from the Capitol after the curfew took effect. ""This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic â not our democratic republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election,â former President George W. Bush, a Republican, said in a statement, without mentioning Trump by name. Trump supporters broke windows and police deployed tear gas inside the building. Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said members of the crowd used chemical irritants to attack police and several had been injured. It was the most damaging attack on the iconic building since the British army burned it in 1814, according to the U.S. Capitol Historical Society. The chaotic scenes unfolded after Trump, who before the election refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost, addressed thousands of supporters near the White House, repeating unfounded claims that the election was stolen from him due to widespread fraud and irregularities. Trump told the supporters they should march on the Capitol to express their anger at the voting process and pressure their elected officials to reject the results, urging them ""to fight."" Biden, a Democrat who defeated the Republican president in the Nov. 3 election and is due to take office on Jan. 20, said the activity of the protesters ""borders on sedition."" "
"GEORGIA: Democrat Jon Ossoff has won his Senate runoff election. His victory makes him the youngest US senator and gives Democrats control the Senate for the opening of Democrat Joe Biden's presidency. Ossoff, 33, defeated 71-year-old Republican David Perdue, who held the seat for the past six years and had the strong support of outgoing President Donald Trump. Democrat Raphael Warnock won one of Georgia's two Senate runoffs Wednesday, becoming the first Black senator in his state's history and putting the Senate majority within the party's reach. A pastor who spent the past 15 years leading the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, Warnock defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler. It was a stinging rebuke of outgoing President Donald Trump, who made one of his final trips in office to Georgia to rally his loyal base behind the state's Republican candidates. In an emotional address early Wednesday, he vowed to work for all Georgians whether they voted for him or not, citing his personal experience with the American dream. His mother, he said, used to pick ``somebody else's cotton'' as a teenager. ``The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,'' he said. ``Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.'' His victory marks a ``reversal of the old southern strategy that sought to divide people,'' Warnock told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' The focus now shifts to the other race between Republican David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Ossoff held a small lead as of early Wednesday afternoon, though it was too early to call the race. Under Georgia law, a trailing candidate may request a recount when the margin of an election is less than or equal to 0.5 percentage points. If Ossoff wins, Democrats will have complete control of Congress, strengthening President-elect Joe Biden's standing as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20. A Democratic sweep would also make it more difficult for Republicans to block Biden's ambitious progressive agenda, along with his Cabinet picks and judicial nominations. This week's elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. The unusually high stakes transformed Georgia, once a solidly Republican state, into one of the nation's premier battlegrounds for the final days of Trump's presidency _ and likely beyond. Warnock's victory is a symbol of a striking shift in Georgia's politics as the swelling number of diverse, college-educated voters flex their power in the heart of the Deep South. It follows Biden's victory in November, when he became the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992. The Associated Press declared Warnock the winner after an analysis of outstanding votes showed there was no way for Loeffler to catch up. Warnock's edge is likely to grow as more ballots are counted, many of which were in Democratic-leaning areas. Loeffler refused to concede in a brief message to supporters shortly after midnight. ``We've got some work to do here. This is a game of inches. We're going to win this election,'' insisted Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state's governor. Loeffler, who remains a Georgia senator until the results of Tuesday's election are finalized, returned to Washington on Wednesday morning to join a small group of senators planning to challenge Congress' vote to certify Biden's victory. Georgia's other runoff election pitted Perdue, a 71-year-old former business executive who held his Senate seat until his term expired on Sunday, against Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. At just 33 years old, Ossoff would be the Senate's youngest member. ``This campaign has been about health and jobs and justice for the people of this state _ for all the people of this state,'' Ossoff said in a speech broadcast on social media Wednesday morning. ``Whether you were for me, or against me, I'll be for you in the U.S. Senate. I will serve all the people of the state.'' Trump's false claims of voter fraud cast a dark shadow over the runoff elections, which were held only because no candidate hit the 50% threshold in the general election. He raised the prospect of voter fraud as votes were being cast and likened the Republicans who run Georgia's election system to ``chickens with their heads cut off'' during a Wednesday rally in Washington. Gabriel Sterling, a top official with the Georgia secretary of state's office and a Republican, said there was ``no evidence of any irregularities.`` ``The biggest thing we've seen is from the president's fertile mind of finding fraud where none exists,`` he said. Both contests tested whether the political coalition that fueled Biden's November victory was an anti-Trump anomaly or part of a new electoral landscape. To win in Tuesday's elections and in the future Democrats needed strong African American support. AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 3,700 voters in Tuesday's contests, found that Black voters made up roughly 30% of the electorate, and almost all of them _ 94% _ backed Ossoff and Warnock. The Democrats also relied on the backing of younger voters, people earning less than $50,000 annually and newcomers to the state. The Republican coalition backing Loeffler and Perdue was the mirror opposite: white, older, wealthier and longtime Georgia residents. The coalition closely resembles the one that narrowly handed Georgia's Electoral College votes to Biden in November, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in almost three decades. Trump's claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, while meritless, resonated with Republican voters in Georgia. About 7 in 10 agreed with his false assertion that Biden was not the legitimately elected president, AP VoteCast found. Election officials across the country, including the Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, as well as Trump's former attorney general, William Barr, have confirmed that there was no widespread fraud in the November election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, where three Trump-nominated justices preside. Even with Trump's claims, voters in both parties were drawn to the polls because of the high stakes. AP VoteCast found that 6 in 10 Georgia voters say Senate party control was the most important factor in their vote. Turnout exceeded both sides' expectations. Ultimately, more people cast ballots in the runoffs than voted in Georgia's 2016 presidential election. Former President Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president, issued a statement praising the election of Georgia's first African American senator and his ability to improve divisions in Washington. `` Georgia's first Black senator will make the (Senate) chamber more reflective of our country as a whole and open the door for a Congress that can forego gridlock for gridlock's sake to focus instead on the many crises facing our nation,'' Obama said. On the ground in Georgia, meanwhile, many in the state's large African American community were ecstatic when they awoke to news of Warnock's win on Wednesday. Tracey Bailey, a 58-year-old assistant community manager at an apartment complex in downtown Atlanta, said she jumped for joy. ``It's going to be great for Georgia, and it's going to be great for our Black community as a whole,'' she said. ``I think he's going to be a fair guy for the people, and that's for all people.''

The exact circumstances surrounding the shooting were unclear. The person said the victim had been taken to a hospital. Their condition was not known. The shooting came as dozens of Trump supporters breached security perimeters and entered the US Capitol as Congress was meeting, expected to vote and affirm Joe Bidens presidential win.

Trump, the Republican incumbent, has not conceded the election, reiterating unverified claims that the presidential polls were rigged. Dozens of lawsuits by his campaign challenging election results have failed in US courts. Biden, a Democrat, is set to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20. Thousands of Trump supporters gathered at various places in downtown Washington with posters and banners âStop the stealâ to âTrump is my president.â US media feared a violent clash between Republican and Democratic supporters. âSome officials feared that if the protests led to violent confrontations, Trump might seek to invoke the Insurrection Act to maintain order and protect the 74 million supporters he falsely contends have been fraudulently disenfranchised by Biden's victory,â The Washington Post reported. âThe protests could indeed get nasty, and the next few days may be very disorderly. But officials, led by some senior members of the administration, have worked hard to prevent a worst-case scenario in which Trump might seek to overturn the election result by deploying the uniformed military and imposing martial law,â the daily said. In a late night statement, the White House said Antifa activists have brutally attacked law-abiding friends, neighbours, and business owners, and destroyed historic landmarks that the communities have cherished for decades. âThis violence and lawlessness have no place in the United States and will be called out for the domestic terrorism that it is,â said the White House. âToday, President Donald J. Trump signed a memorandum to ensure that Federal officials assess actions of Antifa activists in light of Federal laws that restrict the entry of aliens associated with terrorist organizations and aliens intent on criminal activity. President Trump will not allow Antifa, or any terrorist organisation, to destroy our great country,â the statement added. In anticipation of violence, businesses in downtown Washington DC were boarded. Even some of the important places like John's Church of Lafayette Square were fenced. According to The Hill newspaper, district officials are bracing for potentially violent clashes between Trump's supporters and counter protesters, with Mayor Muriel Bowser activating the National Guard to support law enforcement during the demonstrations. The National Guard has been activated in the city. ""Approximately 340 personnel will support the city government from January 5 to 7 by providing crowd control at several Metro stations and assist police with street closures at multiple intersections to provide safety in and around pedestrian areas,"" DC National Guard said in a statement. âI am asking Washingtonians and those who live in the region to stay out of the downtown area on Tuesday and Wednesday and not to engage with demonstrators who come to our city seeking confrontation, and we will do what we must to ensure all who attend remain peaceful,"" Bowser said in a statement.

Coming from all corners of America, the demonstrators said they had answered Trump's appeal to gather in the capital Wednesday, when the US Congress is expected to certify President-elect Joe Biden's election victory. ""My commander-in-chief called me and my Lord and Savior told me"" to come, said Debbie Lusk, 66, a retired accountant from Seattle. ""We either take our country back, or it is no more,"" she told AFP. Trump has confirmed he will address the rally, urging followers on Twitter to ""arrive early"" for his 11:00 am (1600 GMT) speech, to be given at a site near the White House. Last month he tweeted that supporters should head to Washington for what he promised would be a ""wild"" day of protests. Large parts of the downtown area were boarded up, with shops and businesses shuttered by the virus and amid fears of a repeat of the violence that rocked the city during racial-justice protests last year. Trump has refused to accept his election loss, making repeated and unfounded claims of fraud or vote rigging in the states where he was narrowly beaten. Various courts have rejected legal challenges from Trump's team. More than half of Republican voters believe Trump won or aren't sure who did, according to a survey last month from researchers at top US universities, including Harvard. That confusion was echoed by many of the mainly upbeat supporters who had gathered under grey skies at a chilly Freedom Plaza near the White House on Tuesday. ""We don't trust the outcome of the elections,"" said Chris Thomas, 69, a retired saleswoman wearing a Trump hat. Thomas told AFP she and her husband had come from Oregon because they ""believe in the freedom of America"", and to show support for Trump's economic policies that helped their son's wine-chiller business prosper. Warming up the crowd with speeches on Tuesday were longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone and former national security advisor Michael Flynn, each recently pardoned by Trump after being swept up in connection to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow. Flynn warned members of Congress: ""Those of you who are feeling weak tonight, those of you who don't have the moral fiber in your body, get some tonight because tomorrow we the people are going to be here and we want you to know that we will not stand for a lie."" At least 300 supporters had gathered by noon, and almost all of them were flouting Washington's mask-wearing order. Several of them said the media had exaggerated the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 355,000 people in the US. Vice President Mike Pence is to preside over Wednesday's joint session of Congress, in which lawmakers will count and confirm the state-by-state Electoral College votes that decide the presidency. That certification is usually a formality, but Trump has been pressuring his loyal deputy to overturn Biden's win by falsely claiming Pence has the authority to discard pro-Biden votes. ""It would really surprise us if Pence doesn't back Trump,"" Thomas, the retired saleswoman, said. Many demonstrators were hoping for a last-minute surprise that would keep Trump in power beyond January 20, the date of Biden's inauguration. ""Trump won by far. There's more than enough evidence,"" said Matthew Woods, 59, from California. Anthony Lima, also from California, said he had traveled to Washington because he wanted to see for himself what was happening. ""A lot of news agencies don't tell us the truth,"" he said. ""I am open to believe Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the election, I just want an investigation."" "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has signed an executive order barring transactions with eight Chinese apps including Alipay and WeChat Pay to protect America's national security, citing the steps taken by India to ban more than 200 Chinese connected software applications. Trump's order said action is needed to ""deal with the national emergency"" caused by the ""pervasiveness of the spread"" of apps created and controlled in China. The ban against the eight Chinese apps -- Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, and WPS Office -- will come into effect in 45 days from Tuesday. ""The pace and pervasiveness of the spread in the United States of certain connected mobile and desktop applications and other software developed or controlled by persons China, to include Hong Kong and Macau (China), continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,"" Trump said on Tuesday. ""At this time, action must be taken to address the threat posed by these Chinese connected software applications,"" Trump said in his executive order. The orders follow two others Trump signed in August banning dealings with the popular video app TikTok as well as the main WeChat app. Trump said that India has banned the use of more than 200 Chinese connected software applications throughout the country. In a statement, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asserted that the applications were ""stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India,"" according to the executive order. The United States has assessed that a number of Chinese connected software applications automatically capture vast swaths of information from millions of users in the United States, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information, which would allow the Chinese Army and the Chinese Community Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information. âThe United States must take aggressive action against those who develop or control Chinese connected software applications to protect our national security,â he said. Trump said that by accessing personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, Chinese connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information. âThis data collection threatens to provide the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with access to Americans' personal and proprietary information -- which would permit China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, and build dossiers of personal information,â he said. The continuing activity of the PRC and the CCP to steal or otherwise obtain United States persons' data makes clear that there is an intent to use bulk data collection to advance China's economic and national security agenda, Trump said.

"ATLANTA: Polls closed Tuesday evening in a pair of critical election runoffs in Georgia, whose outcome will decide who controls the US Senate and shape the early course of Joe Biden's presidency. The hard-fought races have brought the international spotlight onto this southern state, nine weeks after the most tumultuous US election in two decades. Democrats need both their candidates, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, to prevail in order to snatch the Senate from the Republicans. Outgoing President Donald Trump's party needs either Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue to hold their seat to preserve its majority. US media declared both races too close to call following the close of polls at 7:00 pm (0000 GMT), and Georgia officials have said results may not be known until Wednesday or later. "" Georgia -- The nation is looking to you to lead us forward,"" tweeted President-elect Biden, who like Trump visited the Peach State to rally supporters on the eve of the vote. ""The power is in your hands,"" wrote the 78-year-old Democrat. Georgia was voting during a week of high political tensions in the United States, with Trump desperately scheming to reverse his election loss. On Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence is to preside over a joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College vote that confirmed Biden as the winner of the White House. Trump, who refuses to concede, is planning to address a rally called in protest at the certification, and he urged Pence to ""reject fraudulently chosen electors"" -- a move the vice president has no legal authority to make. Hundreds of Trump supporters wearing red ""Make America Great Again"" caps were already gathered in downtown Washington Tuesday amid a heavy police presence as shop owners, fearing unrest, boarded up windows. Biden beat Trump in Georgia by nearly 12,000 votes in November, but the runoff odds are not in Democrats' favor: Republicans have won all eight statewide runoffs since 1992. Democrats led the early voting in Georgia and nationwide in November, and the expectation is that they did so again in the runoffs, in which a record three million-plus people voted early amid the coronavirus pandemic. Voting figures show Republicans more than Democrats tend to prefer casting ballots in person on election day. With the election on a knife edge, Robert Lowe, a 74-year-old retired improv comedian, called it ""the most important election in my lifetime,"" after casting his ballot at an Atlanta church for the Democrats. If Republicans retain control of the Senate there will be ""continued obstruction"" in Washington, Lowe told AFP. Republicans hold 50 seats in the 100-seat Senate and a victory in just one of the runoff races would give them a majority and the ability to thwart Biden's agenda. Ossoff, 33 and a documentary producer, is running against Perdue, a 71-year-old business executive who was elected to the Senate in 2014. Warnock, a 51-year-old Black pastor, is taking on Loeffler, 50, a businesswoman appointed to the Senate in December 2019. Trump's rally came a day after The Washington Post published a recording of a phone call in which the 74-year-old president pressured Georgia officials to reverse the certified vote of November's election and hand him victory in the state. On the tape, Trump is heard telling Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger he wants to ""find 11,780 votes"" -- one more than Biden's margin of victory. Certification of the Electoral College vote is usually just a formality but dozens of House Republicans and 12 Senate Republicans loyal to Trump have said they will raise objections on Wednesday. The move is doomed to fail, as they are far short of the votes needed to block final validation of the vote. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Monday left the hospital where he has been treated for COVID-19 and boarded a helicopter to return to a White House hit by a wave of infections and a campaign further shadowed by the pandemic four weeks before election day. Wearing what appeared to be a white surgical mask, Trump pumped his fist and gave a thumbs up as he walked down the steps of the Walter Reed Medical Center outside Washington, responding to a reporter's question about how many people were infected at the White House by saying: ""Thank you very much."" The Republican president, running for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 US election, was admitted to the hospital on Friday after being diagnosed with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. ""Feeling really good!"" he said on Twitter earlier. ""Don't be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!"" The disease has killed more than 1 million people worldwide and more than 209,000 in the United States alone- the highest death toll of any country. Trump, 74, has not had a fever in more than 72 hours and his oxygen levels are normal, his medical team told reporters in front of the hospital. The doctors declined, however, to discuss any toll the disease could have on the president's lungs or disclose when Trump last tested negative for the coronavirus. The team added that the president had received supplemental oxygen twice in recent days. ""He may not entirely be out of the woods yet,"" Dr. Sean. P. Conley, the White House physician, said. ""If we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final, deep sigh of relief."" However, Conley said the medical team believed Trump was ready to leave the hospital, stressing he would have world-class medical care around the clock at the White House. Conley said doctors were in ""unchartered territory"" because Trump had received certain therapies so early in the course of the illness. "
"NEW DELHI: With the United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson postponing his visit to India later this month, the Narendra Modi government may heave a sigh of relief while simultaneously it may prove to be a dampener for the farmers protesting on the Delhi borders against the centreâs three agri laws over a month. Johnson had earlier given his assent to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade function on January 26. However, on Tuesday he postponed the visit citing the need to oversee the response of COVID-19 pandemicâs response at home. ""The prime minister spoke to Prime Minister Modi this morning, to express his regret that he will be unable to visit India later this month as planned,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said. âIn light of the national lockdown announced last night, and the speed at which the new coronavirus variant is spreading, the Prime Minister said that it was important for him to remain in the UK so he can focus on the domestic response to the virus,"" Johnson told PM Modi. Back in India, 41 farmer unions have already held seven rounds of talks with the centre and the eighth round is scheduled to take place on January 8, failing which they have threatened to enter Delhi from the national capitalâs borders and hold a âtractor rallyâ. Thousands of protesting farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - for the past 40-odd days. They have been demanding a repeal of three three farm laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP). The sixth round of talks was held between the government and the farmer unions in Vigyan Bhawan on December 30. The two sides agreed on two issues - decriminalisation of stubble-burning and continuation of power subsidies. However, the seventh round held on Monday remained inconclusive as no common ground could be reached on scrapping the three laws and providing a legal guarantee for MSP. On the one side, the farmers have stuck to their demand for repealing the agri laws passed by Parliament in its monsoon session last year. On the other side, the government has made its intention clear of not repealing the three legislation. In this backdrop, the farmers have warned of intensifying their agitation. They are already making preparations for entering Delhi and holding a massive tractor rally on Republic Day. Their intention seems to be to embarrass the government and internationalise it even more on a day when India would be celebrating its 72nd Republic Day and the security agencies would be on highest alert. If the farmers would try to enter Delhi and take out a tractor rally, the law-enforcement forces would not allow them to have their way. Skirmishes between the two sides and even violent clashes may not be ruled out. If violence and injuries take place and loss of property or lives also happen, this is sure to get highlighted in the media in the country and abroad. A similar situation had arisen on February 24 last year when protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were taking place and US President Donald Trump was in Ahmedabad on his first India visit. The Shaheen Bagh protests were going on since December 2019 but it intensified a day before Trump landed in Ahmedabad on February 24 last year. Violent clashes broke out in Northeast Delhi when a head constable lost his life and a DCP was seriously injured. The incident caught the attention of the international media which was present in the country in large numbers due to Trumpâs visit. There were chances of the same scenario arising during the visit of Boris Johnson. As it is, comparisons are being drawn between the ongoing farmersâ protests and the Shaheen Bagh agitation. However, with the UK prime minister postponing his visit, the security agencies would be under slightly less pressure to maintain law and order. Moreover, the presence of international media contingent would also be a curtailed one. This may be a boon in disguise for the centre. The Modi government may heave a sigh of relief. However, it would prove a dampener for the protesting farmers as their tractor rally may not get as much publicity as it would have got had Johnson been present in the Republic Day parade celebrations. "
"WASHINGTON: Pledging that he would ""fight like hell"" to remain in the White House, a desperate US President Donald Trump called on his vice-president Mike Pence to ""come through"" to illegally award him a second term, even as his supporters began descending on the capital on Tuesday for rallies authorities fear will be provocative and violent. Contending that ""there are people intent on coming to our city armed,â authorities in Washington DC, a Democratic-run city, mobilized the National Guard as Trump supporters, many from white supremacist and racist groups, arrived in the city for the so-called ""stop the steal"" rallies outside the White House on Tuesday and Wednesday. But by all accounts except those in the conspiratorial extreme right circles, it is Trump who is trying to steal the election. In a rally in Georgia on Monday, a shrill Trump raised the pitch, asking vice-president Pence, who is tasked at a joint session of Congress on Thursday with formally recognizing Joe Biden as the winner of the Presidential election that has been certified by the states, to defy states' verdict and declare him winner. ""I hope Mike Pence comes through for us. He's a great guy. Of course if he doesn't come through I won't like him quite as much,"" Trump said at a rally aimed at canvassing support for two Republican senate candidates in Georgia. Losing both seats in the run-off elections on Tuesday will pass control of the Senate (current 50-48 in Republican hands) to Democrats. In another feverish gathering of mostly unmasked supporters that raised fears of being a Covid superspreader, Trump mocked a more restrained Biden rally in the state (""they had 14 people in three cars,"" he sneered) while warning that ""America as you know it will be over,"" if Democrats gained control of the Senate. ""And it will never, ever - I believe - be able to come back again. It will be too far gone. Your vote tomorrow could ... be your last chance to save the America that we love,"" told voters in a state that has long been home to many white supremacists who have suppressed black voter turnout to win elections. Georgia turning blue and Democratic on the strength of black and minority turnout in cities such as Atlanta is considered a turning point in US politics, a precursor to other states such as Texas going the same way because of demographic changes and growing minority assertion as the polls. Trump's appeal to Pence was a little more circumspect than his intimidation revealed in leaked phone calls of two Georgia Republican officials. In the call, he first pleaded, then directed the officials to ""recalculate"" presidential vote tally in the state and ""find 11780 votes"" -- just enough for him win the state. Georgia officials not only pushed back on Trump's bogus claim of large-scale fraud but followed it up with a point-by-point rebuttal at a press conference, virtually calling the President a liar. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, who is being hailed for his courage in standing up to Trump's bullying, said he avoided 18 calls from the White House before he reluctantly spoke to the President. He is the second GOP officials to publicly snub Trump by refusing to take his call. Trump has called Republicans who have declined to endorse his bogus claims the ""surrender caucus"" and RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) setting the stage for split between establishment Republicans and insurgents who back his extreme tactics. In a withering takedown of Trump-supporting lawmakers, the conservative commentator George Will called them the country's ""most dangerous domestic enemies."" Trump's blunt direction to Raffensperger to ""find"" the exact number of votes needed to win had led to calls from several quarters for a criminal probe by the FBI and prosecution for attempting to tamper with election results. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general, said Trump should be impeached to set a precedent that ""a president who tries to cheat his way to re-election will be held accountable."" "
"ATLANTA: Control of the US Senate - and with it the ability to block or advance President-elect Joe Biden's agenda - is on the line in a pair of runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday after a dizzying campaign that shattered spending and early turnout records. Incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are trying to hold off Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor at a historic Black church in Atlanta, in a state Biden narrowly carried on Nov. 3. The tumultuous contest's final days have been dominated by President Donald Trump's continued effort to subvert the election results. On Saturday, he pressured the state's Republican secretary of state to reverse Biden's statewide victory, claiming massive fraud contrary to evidence. Illustrating the high stakes, both Trump and Biden campaigned in Georgia on Monday, Trump in the state's northwest and Biden in Atlanta. The president called the Nov. 3 election ""rigged"" and falsely claimed he won the state on Monday, as he used his speech to air grievances about his defeat. ""There is no way we lost Georgia,"" Trump said, ticking off a long list of unfounded conspiracy theories about election fraud. Biden's November win, the first for a Democratic presidential candidate in Georgia in nearly 30 years, was not confirmed for more than a week, and subsequent legal challenges from the Trump campaign pushed the state's final certification into December. Some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump's baseless attacks may suppress turnout among his supporters. However, 50 Trump-supporting voters interviewed by Reuters last month said they planned to vote despite his claims. A double Democratic win would split the Senate 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote giving Democrats control of the Senate. The party already holds a narrow majority in the House of Representatives. A Republican-controlled Senate would likely block many of Biden's most ambitious policy goals in areas such as economic relief, climate change and policing. ""This is not an exaggeration: Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you,"" Biden told Monday's rally. ""One state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation."" Early vote recordPolls are open until 7pm local time (2400 GMT). Some 3 million ballots have already been cast in early in-person and mail voting, mirroring a trend seen in November due to the pandemic. Barring an unexpectedly lopsided result, the winners are unlikely to be known on Tuesday, and perhaps for days, as state officials are not permitted to start tallying early votes until after the polls close. Opinion surveys have shown both races are exceedingly tight. Nearly half a billon dollars in advertising has blanketed the state's airwaves, as dozens of independent political groups have descended on Georgia. Democrats had been encouraged by the early vote, which included strong figures from Black voters, seen as crucial to their chances. But Republicans have historically turned out in higher numbers on Election Day. Perdue and Loeffler have tried to strike a careful balancing act, offering support for Trump's rigged election claims while still arguing they represent the last barrier to an era of unrestrained liberalism in Washington. At Monday's rally, the crowd broke into a ""Fight for Trump"" chant as soon as Trump mentioned Loeffler and Perdue by name. On Monday, Loeffler said she would object to the certification of Biden's win when Congress meets on Wednesday to formally count the presidential vote, joining about a dozen other Republican senators. Perdue, whose term technically ended on Sunday, has voiced support for the extraordinary move, which has virtually no chance of succeeding. The campaign has seen bitter attacks, with Loeffler and Perdue characterizing the Democrats as ""radical socialists"" and Ossoff and Warnock calling the incumbents deeply corrupt. But all four candidates agree on one thing: the election carries enormous consequences. Loeffler said the country's ""way of life"" was on the ballot, while Warnock told supporters Tuesday is a ""defining moment in American history."" The runoff elections, a quirk of state law, became necessary when no candidate in either race earned 50% in November. "
"WASHINGTON: Ten former US defence secretaries spanning administrations over 30 years issued an extraordinary appeal on Sunday to forestall the possibility of a military-supported Trump coup, warning US defence forces to stay out of politics even as the defeated president is making a desperate effort to stay in office by stirring up his extremist supporters. ""Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic,"" the defence secretaries said in an oped amid rising tensions in Washington DC, where a joint session of Congress is to convene on Wednesday to formally recognise Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Echoing Trump's falsehoods and bogus claims that his campaign failed to prove in courts, some of his supporters are urging vice-president Mike Pence to go beyond his ceremonial duties and ignore the verdict of the states and take steps to award the defeated president a second term. Separately, Trump has also placed loyalists in the Pentagon amid reports that they have been balking at cooperating in the transition process. The secretaries cautioned against any disruption in the process, warning that it could lead to where the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation. Constituting an unprecedented smackdown of a prospective Trump coup, the oped was signed by Ashton Carter, Dick Cheney, William Cohen, Mark Esper, Robert Gates, Chuck Hagel, James Mattis, Leon Panetta, William Perry and Donald Rumsfeld â 10 living former US secretaries of defence who served in the Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton administrations. Separately, several former and current lawmakers, including moderate GOP Senators, admonished extremists in the Republican Party who have cottoned on to Trump's bogus claims of an election win. ""The 2020 election is over. All challenges through recounts and appeals have been exhausted. At this point, further attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results,"" a bipartisan group of 10 senators, including four Republicans, said in a statement. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, joined them in warning that it ""is difficult to conceive of a more anti-democratic and anti-conservative act than a federal intervention to overturn the results of state-certified elections and disenfranchise millions of Americans"". The effort by Trump and his fundamentalist mob to steal the election has split the party with even those who previously supported him calling him ""commander in thief"" and a mobster. ""There HAS been absolutely appalling corruption surrounding the 2020 US election. In fact, it's so bad that the perpetrator may now face serious criminal charges. There's just one problem for the man in the White House who's been screaming about the corruption: the perpetrator of itâ¦ is President Donald J. Trump,"" the commentator Piers Morgan wrote on Monday. Morgan, a fervent Trump supporter, said Trump's phone call to two Republican officials in Georgia was ""a blatant attempt by the current president of the United States to make two elected officials commit a deliberate fraud on the American people. Trump is therefore breaking the law, in the most brazen way imaginable"". Several political and legal luminaries are now calling for prosecuting the outgoing president amid persistent speculation that he will pardon himself before he demits office. "
"WASHINGTON: Defeated US President Donald Trump's effort to steal an election he lost decisively comes through loud and clear in a leaked phone call in which he is heard alternately pleading, flattering, intimidating, and threatening two Republican officials in Georgia into manipulating the results. Attesting to the resilience of the democratic system, the two officials stand up to the President courageously, calling out his bogus conspiracy theories and maintaining President-elect Joe Bidenâs 11,779-vote victory in Georgia was fair and accurate. âSo look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,"" Trump says in the hour-long phone call which was first published in the Washington Post. He later adds, âSo what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.â The cajoling is interspersed with implicit threats of criminal prosecution and public backlash if the officials refuse to pursue his false claims of large scale fraud. At one point Trump warns Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that he is taking âa big riskâ and that âthe people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry.â âAnd thereâs nothing wrong with saying, you know, that youâve recalculated,â Trump suggests. Raffensperger responds: âWell, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.â The extraordinary phone call has led to calls for impeaching and prosecuting Trump on charges of violating laws for criminal solicitation of election fraud. Campaigning in Georgia, where two Senate run-off election that could decide the balance of power in Washington takes place tomorrow, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said Trumpâs call was a âbaldfaced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States,â and characterized it as a ""voice of desperation."" ""In any other conceivable moment in our history, this tape would result in the leadership of both parties calling for the resignation of the President of the United States immediately,"" the journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame said, calling it the âthe ultimate smoking gunâ and clearcut evidence of Trumpâs plot âto undermine the electoral system and illegally, improperly and immorally try to instigate a coup in which he remains president of the United States.â While several Republican grandees were also aghast at the Presidential overreach amid talk of a coup, Trump loyalists maintained he was well within his rights to demand state officials revisit the results, even though he made bogus claims that were bluntly rebutted by the state officials who also happen to be establishment Republicans. At one point, Trump claims in the phone call that votes were scanned three times, only to be countered by Raffensperger: âMr. President, they did not. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.âAnother Trump claim: More than 5,000 ballots were cast in Georgia in the name of dead people, Raffensperger: ""The actual number was two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted.""Another time, Trump invokes a rumor to claim ballots were shredded. âDo you think itâs possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because thatâs what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery. Do you know anything about that? Because thatâs illegal, right?âRaffensperger's counsel Ryan Germany responds: âNo, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County.âTrump: âBut have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?âGermany: âNo.âTrump: âAre you sure, Ryan?âGermany: âIâm sure. Iâm sure, Mr. President.âTrump and his cohorts have repeatedly invoked bogus claims and rumors churned out by his conspiratorial followers and recycled in rightwing echo chambers such as OANN and Newsmax to question the result of an election that the Biden-Harris team won by more than 7 million votes and an electoral college margin of 306-232. "
"WASHINGTON: Beijing has good reason to be nervous about US President Donald Trump's diagnosis of testing positive for Covid-19 as his attacks on China regarding the pandemic would harden than ever before. Even at the First Presidential Debate, Trump said that it ""was China's fault"" adding that ""it never should have happened"". According to CNN, Trump has ""constantly played up"" the initial failures by China in controlling the pandemic to blame China and ""particularly the catastrophic effects the virus has had in the United States, where it has killed more than 200,000 people and infected upwards of 7.3 million, including the President himself"". ""Trump's rhetoric has angered Beijing, which has in turn highlighted Washington's own mishandling of the virus through state media and in official comments. Many countries closer to China and exposed to the virus earlier have nevertheless handled it far better than the US, and most experts are critical of how Trump has responded to the pandemic,"" CNN wrote. Global Times' Editor in Chief Hu Xijin said that Trump and First Lady Melania Trump who tested positive for COVID-19 ""have paid the price for his gamble to play down COVID-19"". However, he soon deleted the tweet but it remains ""unclear whether that was a personal decision or a direction from above"". CNN wrote, ""Beijing has good reason to be nervous about Trump's diagnosis. Chinese media and top officials have long complained about the way the country has been, in their words, ""scapegoated"" for the pandemic's effects in the US, and Beijing is decidedly unhappy with being a major topic in the US election."" ""Yet that seems unlikely to change. Trump could now take an even harder line on China, further leaning into the narrative he has already established that Beijing is ultimately to blame,"" it added. Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler on Twitter wrote, ""China lied about this virus and made the World Health Organization complicit in their cover-up. Now, this virus has affected our President and First Lady. We MUST hold China accountable for endangering millions of lives -including our Commander-in-Chief."" Blair Brandt, a Trump campaign fundraiser further attacked the Chinese Communist Party saying that it ""has biologically attacked our President"". CNN further wrote that Beijing ""always valued stability above all else"" but added that Trump's diagnosis "" threatens that stability, setting the stage for an uneasy golden week for China's top leaders."" Trump on Saturday said that he was ""feeling well"" after being hospitalised following his positive diagnosis of coronavirus. He also thanked the ""amazing"" medical staff at Walter Reed hospital for their assistance. ""Doctors, nurses and all at the great Walter Reed Medical Center, and others from likewise incredible institutions who have joined them, are amazing. Tremendous progress has been made over the last six months in fighting this plague. With their help, I am feeling well,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. "
"WASHINGTON: Under the Trump administration, US-India tensions have increased over each side's tariff policies, a Congressional report has said, noting that the two sides have also held concerted negotiations to address these trade frictions. The bipartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), in its latest report, pointed out that India's recent tariff hikes on cell phones and other telecommunication goods went up from zero per cent to 15-20 per cent in the last few years. ""Under the Trump administration, bilateral tensions increased over each side's tariff policies. In general, India has relatively high average tariff rates, especially in agriculture. It can raise its applied rates to bound rates without violating its commitments under the WTO (World Trade Organization), causing uncertainty for US exporters,"" said the CRS report, which is prepared for the members of Congress ahead of trade decisions. The United States and several other countries have requested to join various WTO dispute consultations against India, related to its technology tariffs, also questioning its compliance with the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA). ""India opposes the 25 per cent steel and 10 per cent aluminum national security-based 'Section 232' tariffs that the Trump Administration imposed in 2018. India repeatedly delayed applying planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States in hopes of resolving the issues bilaterally,"" it said. After India lost its eligibility for the US Trade Preference Program, India imposed higher tariffs of 10 per cent to 25 per cent, affecting about $1.32 billion of US exports, such as nuts, apples, chemicals, and steel, the report stated, adding that the two sides are challenging each other's tariffs in the WTO. ""Under the Trump administration, the United States and India held concerted negotiations to address trade frictions. A potential trade deal could include partial restoration by the United States of India's GSP (Generalised System of Preference) benefits in exchange for certain market access commitments according to press accounts,"" CRS said. Yet, the long expected limited trade deal has not materialised to date, the report said. Negotiations under prior administrations on a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) are stalled due to differences on approaches on investor protection. On the government-to-government trade policy, the CRS listed a set of key issues. Main among them was what aspects of bilateral trade relations would change or remain the same under a President-elect Joe Biden-led administration. President Donald Trump, a Republican, is set to be succeeded by Biden, a Democrat on January 20 after he won the November 3 presidential election. Other key issues were, what trade issues should the United States and India prioritise in future talks, the potential for broader trade agreement negotiations, will India and the United States renegotiate entry into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), or potentially seek other ways to engage on regional issues, and are there opportunities for the United States and India to bridge differences on multilateral trade issues. Noting that India and the US have signed defense contracts worth more than $20 billion since 2008, up from $500 million in all previous years combined, the CRS said the future big deals are the purchase of an Integrated Air Defense Weapon System, valued at nearly $ 2 billion, and 30 MQ-9B Sky Guardian drones worth more than $3 billion. ""India is eager for more technology-sharing and co-production initiatives, while the United States urges more reforms in India's defence offsets policy and higher Foreign Direct Investment caps in its defence sector. India's multibillion-dollar deal to purchase the Russian-made S-400 air defense system may trigger US sanctions on India under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,â the CRS said.

"WASHINGTON: US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Sunday said President Donald Trump's phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger showed a 'voice of desperation' from the incumbent president, reported The Hill. According to The Washington Post, Trump urged fellow Republican Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his defeat in an extraordinary one-hour phone call. Addressing the crowd at a campaign event for Georgia Democratic Senate candidates, Harris said: ""Have y'all heard about that recorded conversation?...Well, it was yes certainly the voice of desperation, most certainly that... It was a bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States."" In her speech, the Vice President-elect also slammed the president for calling the Georgia runoffs 'illegal' and 'invalid', saying that he was suggesting that the people of Georgia were committing a crime, reported The Hill. ""And I raise all this to remind us to ask a question always when we see these powerful people that are trying to make it difficult, trying to make it confusing, trying to invalidate our voice,"" she added. In a recording obtained by The Post, Trump ""alternately berated"" Raffensperger, tried to flatter him, begged him to act and threatened him with vague criminal consequences if the secretary of state refused to pursue his false claims, at one point warning that Raffensperger was taking ""a big risk."" ""The people of Georgia are angry, the people in the country are angry... And there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated,"" Trump said in the recording, to which Raffensperger responded, ""Well, Mr President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong."" The Georgia Secretary of State debunked the conspiracy theories by Trump and said President-elect Joe Biden's 11,779-vote victory in Georgia was fair and accurate. ""There's no way I lost Georgia... There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes,"" Trump claimed. Trump further told the Georgia Secretary of State that failure to act by Tuesday would jeopardise the political fortunes of David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Georgia's two Republican senators whose fate in that day's runoff elections will determine control of the US Senate. Trump's call to Raffensperger came as scores of Republicans have pledged to challenge the Electoral College's vote for Biden when Congress convenes for a joint session on Wednesday. Trump has urged supporters to travel to Washington to protest the outcome, and state and federal officials are already bracing for clashes outside the Capitol. President-elect Biden's inauguration is scheduled for January 20. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has nominated Indian-American advocate Vijay Shanker for the position of Associate Judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. In a communique to the Senate on Sunday, Trump said the nomination of Shanker is for a period of 15 years. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanker will replace John R Fisher, who has now retired. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is the highest court for Washington DC. Trump had first announced Shaker's nomination last June. Currently, he serves as Senior Litigation Counsel in the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, and as Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section. Before joining the Department of Justice in 2012, Shanker was in private practice with the Washington, DC, offices of Mayer Brown, LLC and Covington and Burling, LLP. Upon graduation from law school, Shanker served as a law clerk to Judge Chester J Straub on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Shanker completed his bachelors, cum laude, from Duke University and his Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia School of Law, where he served as a Notes Editor for the Virginia Law Review and was inducted into the Order of the Coif.

"WASHINGTON: In an extraordinary rebuke of President Donald Trump, all 10 living former secretaries of defence cautioned on Sunday against any move to involve the military in pursuing claims of  fraud, arguing that it would take the country into ""dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory."" The 10 men, both Democrats and Republicans, signed on to an opinion article published in The Washington Post that implicitly questioned Trump's willingness to follow his Constitutional duty to peacefully relinquish power on January 20. Following the November 3 election and subsequent recounts in some states, as well as unsuccessful court challenges, the outcome is clear, they wrote, while not specifying Trump in the article. ""The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived,"" they wrote. The former Pentagon chiefs warned against use of the military in any effort to change the outcome. ""Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory,"" they wrote. ""Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic."" A number of senior military officers, including General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have said publicly in recent weeks that the military has no role in determining the outcome of US elections and that their loyalty is to the Constitution, not to an individual leader or a political party. The 10 former Pentagon leaders also warned in their Post article of the dangers of impeding a full and smooth transition at defence department prior to Inauguration Day as part of a transfer to power to President-elect Joe Biden. Biden has complained of efforts by Trump-appointed Pentagon officials to obstruct the transition. Without mentioning a specific example, the former defence secretaries wrote that transfers of power ""often occur at times of international uncertainty about US national security policy and posture,"" adding, ""They can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation."" Tensions with Iran represent just such a moment. Sunday marked one year since the US killing of Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general; Iran has vowed to avenge the killing, and US officials said in recent days that they are on heightened alert for potential Iranian attack on US forces or interests in the Middle East. In a further sign of US-Iranian tension, the acting secretary of defence, Christopher Milller, announced on Sunday evening that he has changed his mind about sending the Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, home from the Middle East and instead will keep the vessel on duty. Just last week, Miller announced that he was sending the Nimitz home, a decision that had been opposed by senior military officers. In reversing himself, Miller cited ""recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other US government officials."" He did not elaborate, and the Pentagon did not respond to questions. The opinion article in the Post was signed by Dick Cheney, William Perry, Donald Rumsfeld, William Cohen, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, Ash Carter, James Mattis and Mark Esper. Mattis was Trump's first defence secretary; he resigned in 2018 and was succeeded by Esper, who was fired just days after the November 3 election. The Post reported that the idea for writing the opinion piece began with a conversation between Cheney and Eric Edelman, a retired ambassador and former senior Pentagon official, about how Trump might seek to use the military in coming days. "
"WASHINGTON: Wednesday's congressional joint session to count electoral votes has taken on added importance this year as congressional Republicans allied with President Donald Trump are pledging to try and undo Democrat Joe Biden's victory and subvert the will of the American people. The Republicans - a dozen senators and many more House members - are citing Trump's repeated, baseless charges of widespread fraud. They say they will officially object to the results, forcing votes in the Republican-run Senate and the Democratic-controlled House that will almost certainly fail. There was not widespread fraud in the election, as has been confirmed by a range of election officials and by William Barr, who stepped down as attorney general last month. Neither Trump nor any of the lawmakers promising to object to the count have presented credible evidence that would change the outcome. Nearly all of the legal challenges put forth by Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges. The Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-nominated justices, has also denied requests to hear a pair of cases aimed at invalidating the outcome of the election in key battleground states. The congressional meeting on January 6 is the final step in reaffirming Biden's win, after the Electoral College officially elected him in December. The meeting is required by the Constitution and includes several distinct steps. A look at the joint session: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CONGRESS MEETS WEDNESDAY?Under federal law, Congress must meet Jan. 6 to open sealed certificates from each state that contain a record of their electoral votes. The votes are brought into the chamber in special mahogany boxes used for the occasion. Bipartisan representatives of both chambers read the results out loud and do an official count. The president of the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence, presides over the session and declares the winner. The session begins at 1pm EST. WHAT DOES THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRE?The Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral votes. If there is a tie, then the House decides the presidency, with each congressional delegation having one vote. That hasn't happened since the 1800s, and Biden's electoral win over Trump was decisive, 306-232. HOW DOES THE SESSION UNFOLD?The two chambers meet together midday to count the votes . If the vice president cannot preside, there is precedent for the Senate pro-tempore, or the longest-serving senator in the majority party, to lead the session. That's currently Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The presiding officer opens and presents the certificates of the electoral votes in alphabetical order of the states. The appointed ""tellers"" from the House and Senate, members of both parties, then read each certificate out loud and record and count the votes. At the end, the presiding officer announces who has won the majority votes for both president and vice president. WHAT IF THERE'S AN OBJECTION?After a teller reads the certificate from a state, any member can stand up and object to that state's vote on any grounds. But the presiding officer will not hear the objection unless it is in writing and signed by both a member of the House and a member of the Senate. If there is such a request, then the joint session suspends and the House and Senate go into separate sessions to consider it. For the objection to be sustained, both chambers must agree to it by a simple majority vote. If they do not both agree, the original electoral votes are counted with no changes. The last time such an objection was considered was 2005, when Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, objected to Ohio's electoral votes, claiming there were voting irregularities. Both the House and Senate debated the objection and easily rejected it. It was only the second time such a vote had occurred. WHO IS EXPECTED TO OBJECT?Dozens of House Republicans and a smaller group of GOP senators are expected to object to the count from some swing states where Trump has alleged fraud, despite the consensus of nonpartisan election officials and even Trump's former attorney general that there was none. None of the members have presented detailed evidence and none of them objected to the swearing-in of congressional lawmakers who won election on the same ballots. In the Senate, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley was the first to say he would join with the House Republicans. On Saturday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced a coalition of 11 additional senators who vowed to vote against unspecified state electors on Wednesday unless Congress appoints an electoral commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. Hawley and Cruz are both among potential 2024 presidential contenders. The challenges have split the party. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has urged his colleagues not to object, saying last month on a private call that the vote would be ``terrible.'' Several other Senate Republicans have criticized the effort as well, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn and South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican. Thune said last month that any objections will go down ``like a shot dog'' in the Senate. On Sunday, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said the challenge is ""bad for the country and bad for the party."" WHAT IS PENCE'S ROLE?Pence's role is largely ceremonial and he has no power to affect the outcome, despite Trump's wishes to the contrary. The role of the vice president as presiding officer is often an awkward one, as it will be for Pence, who will be charged with announcing Biden's victory - and his own defeat - once the electoral votes are counted. Pence won't be the first vice president put in an uncomfortable situation. In 2001, Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000 presidential election he narrowly lost to Republican George W. Bush. Gore had to gavel several Democrats' objections out of order. In 2017, Biden presided over the count that declared Trump the winner. Biden also shot down objections from House Democrats that did not have any Senate support. ONCE CONGRESS COUNTS THE VOTES, WHAT'S NEXT?The joint session is the last official chance for objections, beyond court cases that have so far proven ineffective for Trump and his team. ""I think there comes a time when you have to realize that, despite your best efforts you've been unsuccessful,"" Cornyn said earlier this month. "
"WASHINGTON: Two top US health officials on Sunday disputed a claim by President Donald Trump that federal data on Covid-19 cases and deaths in the US is overblown, and both expressed optimism that the pace of vaccinations is picking up. ""The deaths are real deaths,"" Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on ABC News' This Week, adding that jam-packed hospitals and stressed-out healthcare workers are ""not fake. That's real."" Fauci and US Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who appeared on CNN's State of the Union, defended the accuracy of coronavirus data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after Trump attacked the agency's tabulation methods. ""The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of the @CDCgov's ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries, many of whom report, purposely, very inaccurately and low,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump, a Republican who leaves office on January 20 after losing a bid for a second term to Democrat Joe Biden, has frequently has downplayed the severity of the pandemic. He has also scorned and ignored federal recommendations for containing the spread. The Covid-19 death toll in the US has surpassed 350,000 as experts anticipate another surge in coronavirus cases and deaths stemming from holiday gatherings over Christmas and New Year's. Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows the US passed the threshold early Sunday morning. More than 20 million people in the country have been infected. ""From a public health perspective, I have no reason to doubt those numbers and I think people need to be very aware that it's not just about the deaths,"" Adams said. ""It's about the hospitalisations, the capacity."" Fauci and Adams expressed optimism that the pace of vaccinating Americans against the virus is accelerating after a slow start. More than 4.2 million people have been inoculated since December 14 with one of two vaccines, far short of the Trump administration's goal of 20 million by the end of 2020. ""We wanted to get to 20 million, but some glimmer of hope is that in the last 72 hours, they've gotten 1.2 million doses into peoples' arms, which is an average of about 500,000 a day,"" Fauci said. ""We are not where we want to be. There's no doubt about that. But I think we can get there."" He said he believed that the number of daily vaccinations could be expanded to 1 million and called for ""a real partnership"" between the federal and state governments. The US state of California, meanwhile, reported 53,341 new cases. The increase brings the total for the state to almost 2.3 million - with only six countries globally having more infections. Also, New York state passed 1 million Covid-19 cases, after a sombre year in which more than 30,000 of its residents died from the virus. "
"WASHINGTON: On the first day of the 117th Congress, a lawmaker has introduced a bill in the US House of Representatives to terminate the designation of Pakistan as a Major non-NATO Ally. Introduced by Republican Congressman Andy Biggs, the bill removes Pakistan's designation as a major non-NATO ally, a status that allows for various benefits such as access to excess US defense supplies and participation in cooperative defense research and development projects. The bill also notes that the US President cannot issue a separate designation of Pakistan as a Major NATO ally, unless a presidential certification that Pakistan continues to conduct military operations that are contributing to significantly disrupting the safe haven and freedom of movement of the Haqqani Network in Pakistan. It also seeks a presidential certification that Pakistan has taken steps to demonstrate its commitment to prevent the Haqqani Network from using any Pakistani territory as a safe haven and that the Pak government actively coordinates with Afghanistan to restrict the movement of militants, such as the Haqqani Network, along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The bill also asks the president to certify that Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani Network senior leaders and mid-level operatives. Pakistan was named a Major non-NATO ally during the Bush Administration in 2004. Currently, there are 17 Major non-NATO ally. Brazil was the last country to given this designation by President Donald Trump in 2019. The designation gives the countries to entry into cooperative research and development projects with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a shared-cost basis, participation in certain counter-terrorism initiatives, purchase of depleted uranium anti-tank rounds, priority delivery of military surplus (ranging from rations to ships). It also gives them access to War Reserve Stocks of DoD-owned equipment that are kept outside of American military bases, offers them loans of equipment and material for cooperative research and development projects and evaluations and permission to use American financing for the purchase or lease of certain defense equipment. The designation among other things expedites export processing of space technology and permission for the country's corporations to bid on certain DoD contracts for the repair and maintenance of military equipment outside the United States. However, President Trump in January 2018 suspended all financial and security assistance to Pakistan. The outgoing Trump Administration even considered terminating the designation of Pakistan as a Major non-NATO ally. Under the Obama Administration, US designated India as a Major Defense Partner. "
"WASHINGTON: One cartoon shows him barricading himself inside the White House with heavy-duty locks and bolts. Another shows a crane hoisting him out of 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue. A third shows the Statue of Liberty's upraised arm catapulting him into outer space. US President Donald Trump's loss in the presidential election is a foregone conclusion barring partisan, activist judicial intervention. But when and how he will concede defeat is animating both chroniclers of contemporary history and his own inner circle, which is reported to be mortally afraid of giving the notoriously tetchy President the bad news. The solution: Let him hear the drip-drip-drip of setbacks from the counting front, where he is now behind in four battleground states, and from courts, which have largely ruled against him, amid some insignificant victories. For instance, in Pennsylvania, courts agreed that poll observers could move closer to counting tables, something Trump presented as a massive legal victory. Even Republican lawyers concede that such verdicts are not ""outcome determinative"" and many of the procedural complaints are not well-founded. That hasn't stopped Trump, who has famously said he hates to lose, from launching a volley of lies and falsehoods on Twitter, many of which the social media platform flagged and masked for misinformation. Among them were claims that ""tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states"" and ""hundreds of thousands of Votes were illegally not allowed to be OBSERVED... This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States, including Pennsylvania, which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night, only to see a massive lead disappear, without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE, for long intervals of time, what the happened..."" ""Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously & crudely not allowed. Tractors blocked doors & windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms. BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE. BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE!"" Trump added in another bogus claim. Counting of votes does not take place without observers from both sides present, and the volley of tweets appeared aimed at inciting his base of conspiracy theorists who live in a nonsensical echo chamber. But even the Trump-leaning media like Fox News and WSJ are now preparing him for defeat, with lower court ruling going against the President and the US Supreme Court seemingly reluctant to intervene. The scenario now emerging is one where the President will not concede defeat right up until Inauguration Day, and if states certify election results that gives electoral votes from each state to whoever got majority of that state's popular vote (which would confirm Biden as the winner), Trump will carry his grievance immediately to his now expanded base, immediately launching his 2024 Presidential election campaign. In fact, Trump filed to run for President in 2020 as soon as he won the 2016 elections, an option available in a country that is a perpetual election machine. Midterm congressional elections- when the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate will be up for re-election- will also be available for Trump to test the waters. All that provided he survives the legal challenges that are certain to cascade upon him once he demits office -- which is why one scenario often envisaged is him resigning before January 20 to enable his vice-president Mike Pence to succeed him so he (Trump) can obtain a pardon. The catch here: Some cases are under state jurisdiction; a President is empowered to pardon only federal crimes. Alternately, Trump could push legal and executive boundaries by pardoning himself. Twice during his presidency, he has tweeted that he has the âabsolute right to PARDON myself.â For now though, the US President appears hellbent on fighting it out till all legal options run out, and perhaps even after, as some in his inner circle, including his sons Don Jr and Eric, have urged. There will be no concession speech- which in any case is a convention, not required by law -- although it has been a norm for 124 years delivered by every defeated candidate. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump was in a military hospital on Saturday for treatment after testing positive for Covid-19, an extraordinary development that upended the presidential race a month before the Nov. 3 election. Roughly 17 hours after he made his diagnosis public, Trump walked slowly from the White House to a waiting helicopter to be taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He wore a mask and business suit and did not speak to reporters. ""I think I'm doing very well, but we're going to make sure that things work out,"" Trump said in a brief video message posted on Twitter. Early on Friday, he had tweeted that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, had contracted the virus. Trump will work in a special suite at the hospital for the next few days as a precautionary measure, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. Online video showed a small group of Trump supporters outside Walter Reed late on Friday waving Trump 2020 flags, most not wearing masks. Trump, 74, has a mild fever, according to a source familiar with the matter. White House doctor Sean P. Conley said late on Friday that Trump was doing very well, did not need supplemental oxygen, and had received a first dose of Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc that has been shown to shorten hospital stays. In a tweet late on Friday, the president wrote: ""Going well, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!"" Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1601695894000The diagnosis was the latest setback for the Republican president, who is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. Trump has played down the threat of the coronavirus pandemic from the outset, even as the disease has killed more than 200,000 Americans and hammered the US economy. A number of other prominent Republicans also tested positive on Friday, including former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and Republican senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis. Vice President Mike Pence, who would take over presidential duties if Trump became severely ill, tested negative, a spokesman said. The former Indiana governor, 61, is working from his own residence several miles from the White House. Trump is at high risk because of his age and weight. He has remained in apparent good health during his time in office but is not known to exercise regularly or to follow a healthy diet. Conley said earlier on Friday that Trump has received an experimental treatment, Regeneron's REGN-COV2, one of several experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are used for treating a wide range of illnesses. Trump is also taking zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Conley said. Stocks on Wall Street closed lower as news of Trump's diagnosis added to mounting uncertainties surrounding the election. Chinese President Xi Jinping, joining well-wishers at home and abroad, sent a message to Trump and his wife on Saturday, wishing them a speedy recovery, Chinese state television reported. ELECTION DAY LOOMS With just 31 days to go until Election Day, Trump's campaign said it would postpone rallies and other events where he was scheduled to appear, or take them online. Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien, also tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday and will work from home, according to a senior campaign official. Biden pulled ads attacking Trump off the air but otherwise continued his campaign, traveling to Michigan on Friday after testing negative for the virus. At a union hall in Grand Rapids, Biden said he was praying for his rival's recovery. However, he also implicitly criticized Trump, who has mocked Biden for routinely wearing a mask and has held huge campaign rallies with little social distancing. ""Be patriotic,"" Biden said. ""It's not about being a tough guy. It's about doing your part."" The Republican National Committee would choose a replacement nominee if Trump were to become incapacitated, but it is too late in most states to change the names on the ballot. Some 2.9 million people have already voted, according to figures compiled by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald. Pence took over Trump's planned calls with governors and retirees' organizations. His Oct. 7 debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris will go forward as planned, organizers said. Harris has also tested negative, according to the campaign. The virus could complicate Trump's push to install conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court. In addition to the president and his wife, at least four people who were at a White House event to announce Barrett's nomination - Conway, Lee, Tillis and University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins - said Friday they have tested positive. Lee and Tillis are both members of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to begin hearings on Barrett's nomination on Oct. 12. Barrett herself tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, according to a person familiar with the matter. Tillis, who said in a statement that he has no symptoms, will isolate at home for 10 days. Polls show a close race between him and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham for his North Carolina seat, one of several Democrats hope to flip in their quest to win a Senate majority in November. Trump is the latest world leader to contract the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was rushed into intensive care after falling gravely ill in March. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called the virus a ""little flu"" after being infected in July. Both men recovered. "
"WASHINGTON: America's founding fathers designed the vice-presidential office to be so ineffectual that its early occupants often abandoned the post. Thomas Jefferson, the second vice-president, called it âthe most insignificant office ever that the invention of man contrived,â before fleeing to his estate in Monticello to pursue other interests. When a butler asked Theodore Roosevelt where to store a White House chandelier that bothered the President with its tinkling, he replied, ""Take it to the Vice President, he needs something to keep him awake."" But in an absurd drama worthy of Beckett and Ionesco, a cohort of Republican lawmakers is attempting to subvert US election results that favored Democrat Joe Biden by arguing that vice-president Mike Pence can ignore certification of electors from ""disputed"" states and pick Trump loyalist electors to give the incumbent a second term. The dirty little secret hidden in this exercise: the loyalists represent constituencies chafing at loss of white primacy to a coalition of blacks, minorities, liberals, and feminists among others who put the Biden-Harris team in office. The effort to obtain legal cover for a vice-presidential coup to give Trump a second term has been ridiculed in legal circles and thrown out of courts -- including rejection by an appeals court on Saturday. By that logic, legal experts and political pundits point out, vice president Joe Biden could have decided to install President Hillary Clinton rather than Donald Trump on January 6, 2017. Trump himself alleged irregularities in an election where he lost the popular vote. And on January 6, 2001, Vice President Al Gore could have named himself the winner of the 2000 election which George Bush won controversially with Supreme Court intervention. There is another catch. Some 150 Trump loyalist lawmakers, including 12 Republican Senators dubbed the ""dirty dozen"" by the tabloid press, are pursuing the line that there was fraud in the Presidential election, but their own election on the same day was untainted. Compounding the confusion, many Republican lawmakers, including the party's Senate leadership, had recognized Biden as the legitimate winner. All this will come up for play on January 6, when the vice-president presides over a joint session of Congress to recognize certification of electoral college votes from states in what has long been a ceremonial process. That process is now being turned into a divisive political spectacle that some experts are saying could have profound consequences for the Republican Party and the United States itself. Caught in this maelstrom is incumbent vice-president Mike Pence, who calls himself ""a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order."" Despite the numbers being stacked against a Trump loyalist coup, Pence indicated on Saturday that he will support the doomed bid by a dozen Republican Senators to overturn Joe Biden's election because he ""shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities."" Like scores of Republicans with an eye on future political prospects, Pence is also torn between loyalty to Trump and fealty to the party -- and facts and numbers that will compel him to declare Biden as next President. The political atmosphere is so fraught even within the Republican Party that a pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood jolted the establishment by suggesting on Friday that Pence could âface execution by firing squadâ for âtreasonâ if he doesnât go along with Trump loyalists bid to subvert the election. Separately, Texas lawmaker Louie Gohmert, whose bizarre lawsuit essentially arguing that the vice-president could elect the President was trashed by courts, suggested the ruling constituted an incitement to violence. ""The bottom line is, the court is saying, 'we're not going to touch this, you have no remedy. Essentially, the ruling would be, 'you have to go to the streets and be as violent as antifa, BLM,'"" Gohmert told a right-wing channel replete with conspiracy theories and is endorsed by Trump. Trump had called for a rally on January 6 in Washington DC, a black majority city governed by Democrats. Local officials are concerned that far-right, white supremacist groups such as âProud Boysâ will return to the District and âpick fights, create damage, damage property, and then act in a very threatening wayâ like they did during a mid-December rally.

"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is ""well"" and will continue to perform his duties ""without disruption"" while quarantining along with the first lady, after both tested positive for the coronavirus, the president's physician said Friday. They ""are both well at this time and they plan to remain home at the White House during their convalesence,"" doctor Sean Conley said in a statement. ""I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering."" "
"WASHINGTON: Facebook said it removed campaign ads for US President Donald Trump which appeared to stoke fear by claiming that his Democratic rival Joe Biden would pose threats by allowing more immigration. The move late Wednesday marked the latest by the leading social network seeking to curb misinformation while seeking to steer clear of political involvement. The messages, which remained visible in the Facebook ad library, said Biden was ""dangerous for America"" and claimed the Democrat would allow a ""surge"" in immigration, suggesting this could increase coronavirus and security risks. ""We rejected these ads because we don't allow claims that people's physical safety, health, or survival is threatened by people on the basis of their national origin or immigration status,"" Facebook said in a statement. The ad rejection underscored the challenge for social platforms seeking to sift through mountains of false claims during a heated election campaign, many of which come from Trump. Facebook earlier this year removed a Trump ad which contained a symbol used in Nazi Germany to designate political prisoners. Separately, Facebook also said it was clarifying its rules on ads seeking to question the legitimacy of the electoral process amid the latest Trump comments suggesting he may not trust the ballot count. ""In addition to banning ads that make premature declarations of victory, we also won't allow ads with content that seeks to delegitimize the outcome of the US election,"" Facebook product manager Rob Leathern said. ""This would include calling a method of voting inherently fraudulent or corrupt, or using isolated incidents of voter fraud to delegitimize the result of an election."" "
"MUMBAI/BENGALURU: The outgoing US president Donald Trump has extended the ban on H-1B and L-1 work visas through March, the latest in a series of hard-line immigration policies. In June, Trump signed a proclamation suspending the issuance of certain categories of worker visas through December 31. H-1Bs and L-1s are used extensively by Indian IT companies, as also US technology companies to recruit Indian talent. The latest move will impact IT professionals who were already issued H-1B visas for the 2021 fiscal beginning October 1. It is not clear whether incoming president Joe Biden will rescind the ban when he takes office on January 20. Cyrus Mehta, managing attorney and founder of New York-based law firm Cyrus D Mehta & Partners, said the visa ban extension contradicts its rationale to protect US jobs after Trumpâs recent claim that the unemployment rate is below 6.7%. âIt is Trumpâs last gasp to hurt immigration that benefits the US as the skilled workers impacted promote economic recovery. Although the ban was enjoined by the court in NAM (National Association of Manufacturers) v Trump, that ruling was limited to the plaintiff organisations that brought the suit. Therefore, the extension will still be effective on others,â he said. Mehta said Trump deliberately planted this time bomb for Biden, knowing that it would be politically unpalatable to rescind the ban on day 1 since unemployment due to Covid-19 is still high. But at least the new banâs shelf life is only till March 31, he noted. Stephen Yale-Loehr, professor of immigration law practice, Cornell Law School, said, âBarring temporary foreign workers from entering the country was a mistake in June. It remains a mistake today.â Rajiv S Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, said an extension of the travel ban would be challenged in courts and defeated on the same grounds on which the government suffered a preliminary injunction. âA US district court in the case of National Association of Manufacturers and others had held that the travel ban proclamation here deals with a purely domestic economic issue â the loss of employment during a national pandemic. In domestic economic matters, the national security and foreign affairs justification for policy implementations disappear, and the normal policy-making channels remain the default rules of the game, the court had held,"" he said. The Trump administration has challenged this lawsuit and it was to come up for hearing in mid-January. Trump has taken many measures that have made it more difficult for Indian IT services companies to get US long-term work visas. American tech companies, however, were not as constrained in accessing these visas. Indian IT services companies need these visas to service American customers, who constitute 50-60% of their revenue, and have been trying to overcome the visa constraints by hiring local Americans. Many in India hope president-elect Joe Biden will roll back some of these measures. Biden has supported the expansion of the number of high-skilled visas, and the elimination of limits on employment-based visas by country. "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans in the US Senate are expected to take steps toward overriding his veto of a major defense bill in a rare New Year's Day session on Friday and hand him his first major rebuke 20 days before he leaves office. Republican lawmakers have largely stood by the president during his turbulent four years in the White House. Since losing his re-election bid in November, Trump has lashed out at them for not fully backing his unsupported claims of voting fraud, rejecting his demand for bigger Covid-19 relief checks and for moving toward the veto override. The Republican-led Senate is set to reconvene at noon EST (1700 GMT) to take up the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Trump refused to sign into law because it does not repeal certain legal protections for tech companies. Senators are expected to cast the first of two procedural votes aimed at overriding Trump's veto, after the House of Representatives successfully voted to overturn it on Monday. If that succeeds, the Senate would then hold a second procedural vote followed by a final vote on passage on its last day in session on Saturday. Democrats, who in an unusual alignment with Trump welcomed his call for $2,000 direct relief payments, had hoped to use the NDAA to force a swift vote on a bill authorizing the checks, which would give Americans more than the $600 coming now. Some Republicans also back larger payouts. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell quashed the effort, tying larger checks to a competing bill with social media and election provisions that Democrats are sure to reject with little time left for maneuvering before the next Congress is sworn in on Sunday. Trump, who returned to Washington on Thursday from his private club in Florida, has ramped up pressure on fellow Republicans and slammed party leadership for failing to do his bidding on the two measures. ""Weak and tired Republican 'leadership' will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass,"" he said in a string of tweets this week, adding: ""Unless Republicans have a death wish ... they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP!"" Republican tensions are also rising over some conservatives' plan to object next Wednesday when the new Congress officially tallies the Electoral College votes certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential victory before he is sworn in on Jan. 20. McConnell, who publicly acknowledged Biden's win, on Thursday raised questions in a call with his caucus over fellow Republican Senator Josh Hawley's plan to object, according to media reports. At least 140 Republicans in the House are expected to launch similar objections despite Congress' largely ceremonial role, CNN reported. Representatives for McConnell did not respond to a Reuters query seeking comment on the planned maneuvers, which could trigger a lengthy Senate debate but have no chance of overturning the results. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump alleged on Wednesday that there had been ""surprise ballot dumps"" in states where he had been leading Democrat Joe Biden in the race for the White House. ""Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled,"" Trump tweeted. ""Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted."" Trump did not offer any evidence for his allegation of ""ballot dumps"" and there have been no reports of any irregularities. The leads in numerous states have shifted back-and-forth between the candidates as votes are counted. "
"WASHINGTON: There's little doubt that Nancy Pelosi will be reelected House speaker when the new Congress convenes Sunday. It could take a high-wire act for her to get there, largely thanks to the pandemic. The only woman in history to serve as speaker, the California Democrat has a reputation as a formidable vote-counter and wily deal-cutter. Those skills have helped her fend off threats and cement her as leader of her party in the House since 2003, and seem likely to carry the day on Jan. 3, when the Constitution requires the new Congress to begin. ""Yeah, I do,'' Pelosi told a reporter this week when asked if she had the votes wrapped up. In what seemed an indication of confidence, Pelosi told reporters Wednesday that Rep.-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, will be sworn in, even as Democratic opponent Rita Hart's challenge to the election results remains under review by the House. Miller-Meeks is certain to vote against Pelosi to be speaker. Even so, the terrain Pelosi faces will allow almost no margin for error. The full House elects the speaker, and Democrats will have the chamber's smallest majority in 20 years in a vote in which Republicans are certain to vote unanimously against her, joined by Democratic defectors. Democrats will have a 222-211 edge, with one race still undecided and one vacancy after Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., died Tuesday after battling Covid-19. The raging coronavirus pandemic, combined with routine illnesses and the usual risks of wintertime travel, could make attendance unpredictable for the first House roll call in months that lawmakers will have to attend in person. To avoid risks of exposure to Covid-19, the House altered its rules this year to let its members vote by proxy from their homes, but that change dies with the old Congress. ""I'm fine,'' Pelosi said when asked if COVID-19 absences were a concern. The speaker's election, in which members traditionally vote verbally in alphabetical order, has long been the first vote taken by the new House. Because of COVID-19 concerns, lawmakers will be voting in groups in a roll call expected to last three to four hours. ""It's extraordinarily tricky'' for Pelosi, said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., an 18-year congressional veteran. Still, he said, he expects her to prevail ""because I don't see what the alternative is'' for Democrats. To make sure they're at full strength, both parties' leaders are urging lawmakers to take health precautions and return to Washington well ahead of Sunday to avoid travel snags. In memos this week, Congress' chief physician, Dr. Brian Monahan, and House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving told House members that any guests, including family, will have to follow local District of Columbia requirements for COVID-19 testing. On a day when members' families and friends normally swarm all over the Capitol, incoming House freshmen will be allowed just one guest apiece in the chamber's gallery to watch them take their oaths. Returning members will not be allowed any guests in the gallery. An email from Monahan distributed to lawmakers Wednesday described testing, quarantine and mask-wearing guidelines. It said travel to Washington by members' relatives ""is highly likely to involve significant hardships and disease exposure risks that are best avoided.'' Top Democrats have checked on the availability of lawmakers who've had serious health problems. McGovern says Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., 84, who's been fighting pancreatic cancer, has told him he intends to attend. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., who nearly died from pneumonia after falling while running in March and has been convalescing ever since, says he's told Pelosi he will return to the Capitol for opening day. ""I'm planning on going back because that's my job,'' said DeSaulnier, 68. Pelosi retains the support of most Democrats, who revere her for leading their 2018 recapture of House control and their battles against President Donald Trump. She's kept her party's moderates and progressives largely united and raised boatloads of campaign cash. But at 80, about the same age as her top two lieutenants, Pelosi remains a source of frustration for younger Democrats eager to climb the leadership chain. Discontent and division have grown after expected gains in last month's elections evaporated and 12 Democrats lost House seats, prompting calls for fresh messengers in response to criticism that party leaders did a poor job of campaigning on the country's deep economic problems. No Democratic rival to Pelosi has emerged, greatly diminishing the odds she'll be toppled. Perhaps unanimously, Republicans will back Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California for speaker, but he seems destined to become minority leader again. Even so, Pelosi must minimize the number of Democrats opposing her. Of 15 Democrats who bucked her when she was elected speaker in January 2019, three lost reelection last month. One is in a race where votes are still being counted and another became a Republican. That leaves 10 Democrats who opposed her two years ago. Of those, Washington Rep. Kurt Schrader has said he's now open to backing her and at least two others have said they will do so, Jason Crow of Colorado and Jim Cooper of Tennessee. ""She has led a contentious Democratic caucus well during the pandemic and the Trump presidency,'' Cooper said. It's unknown how many of the 15 incoming Democratic freshmen might oppose Pelosi. Some suggest the tight numbers might encourage Pelosi's Democratic critics to force the balloting into a rare second round, when she could eventually win but perhaps be forced into promises about bills the House would consider or other concessions. People mentioning this scenario insisted on anonymity to describe behind-the-scenes conversations. Voting for speaker has needed multiple ballots only 14 times, including in 1923, the only time that has occurred since the Civil War. "
"Americans have cast their votes in record numbers. For an early indication of where the vote is headed, here are the key states to look out for ...1. Florida, Florida, Florida! Polls have closed in Florida, a pivotal swing state is geared up for early counting of all votes (unlike many other states). If Biden is the projected winner there, he is 80 per cent on his way to the White House. This is because he already has a lock on 217 electoral votes in Democrat-strongholds and Blue leaning states (assuming he does not lose any), and Florida's 29 electoral votes puts him within striking distance of 270.   2. Georgia and North Carolina: Trump comfortably won both states in 2016, and polls show Biden competitive in both states, which is why Trump has had to campaign so hard to keep them in his column. But if black voters in these two states, fired up by the Black Lives Matter movement, turn out in strength (early voting suggests they might have) and if Trump has not expanded his base with in-person turnout on Tuesday, the Biden has a good chance. So if he wins Georgia (16 electoral votes) and North Carolina (15) in addition to Florida (29), and retains the other Democratic states Hillary Clinton won, then the 60 electoral votes would put him past 270 and it will be game over for Trump. The messy counting in the rust belt states (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin) would not matter. But Trump retains Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina, he would still have to win the rust belt states to cross 270 and win a second term. Most polls show Biden in the lead in rust belt states too, poised to recapture the so-called Democratic blue wall that crumbled before Trump in 2016. Which is why Trump and his campaign are so keen to stall counting of mail-in ballots in these states (which tend to favor Democrats) and declare win on the basis of in-person votes (which are counted early and tend to favor Republicans). But to do that, Trump will first have to win Florida. Trump's future will rise or set in the sunshine state. "
"WASHINGTON: Lines of honking SUVs, pickup trucks and motorcycles, flying flags for US President Donald Trump are raising security concerns, election experts say - particularly on the country's last day of voting. One of the caravans, known as ""Trump Trains,"" sparked a confrontation on a highway outside Austin, Texas, on Friday, when it surrounded a campaign bus for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, and one member allegedly sideswiped a car, leading to an FBI investigation. On Sunday, a Trump caravan in Richmond, Virginia left the roadway to drive on the grass near the Lee Monument, Richmond police said on Facebook. Members allegedly pepper sprayed a woman, police said, and they are investigating reports that an unoccupied car was shot. A slew of Trump Train events are planned for Tuesday, the United States' official Election Day, according to posts on Facebook and interviews with organizers. Several are advertised as ending or going past polling stations. Election security experts say they are concerned the rallies could break laws, intimidate voters or spiral into violent confrontations. ""The Austin thing shows that it's not noise,"" said Michael Greenberger, the director of the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland. ""Disruption tomorrow is going to be the kind of thing that we haven't seen in our prior federal elections,"" he predicts. Most Trump Train events have gone off peacefully, and the three organizers who Reuters spoke to Monday stressed that they condemn what happened in Texas. A Reuters review of public Facebook events Monday afternoon found about a dozen ""Trump Train"" caravans planned for Election Day. More are likely to be organized through private groups, experts said. Several public itineraries include plans to drive past, or through, polling locations. State and federal laws make voter intimidation illegal, and many states have laws against campaigning on or near polling stations. One such event, organized on Facebook in southeastern Maryland's Wicomico County, outlines a route that goes past the Civic Center and the ""election office."" The organizer, who gave his name as Mark F. when contacted through Facebook, told Reuters the caravan of vehicles plans to slowly drive through the parking lot of the Civic Center, one of the county's nine voting centers. Election officials have asked him to change the route, he said, but as of Monday afternoon he hadn't decided whether to accede to their request and drive on the road next to the site instead. ""There's nobody that can stop us,"" he said, arguing that Trump supporters had the right to be on county property making a last-minute appeal to voters. ""I'm going to let everybody know that Biden's not the way to go,"" he said. He timed the event for about 3:15 in the afternoon, when he said he thinks the site will be most heavily crowded with voters. Trump retweeted a video of the Austin caravan on Saturday, commenting ""I LOVE TEXAS!"" The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Tuesday's planned caravans. Greenberg, who is advising officials on security at polling places, said he hoped the incident in Texas would deter more extreme Trump supporters. ""I think having the FBI saying they're looking at Austin may cause some people, not everyone, to think twice about interference."" "
"NEW YORK/FRANKFURT: Deutsche Bank AG is looking for ways to end its relationship with President Donald Trump after the US elections, as it tires of the negative publicity stemming from the ties, according to three senior bank officials with direct knowledge of the matter. Deutsche Bank has about $340 million in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the President's umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons, according to filings made by Trump to the US Office of Government Ethics in July and a senior source within the bank. The three loans, which are against Trump properties and start coming due in two years, are current on payments and personally guaranteed by the president, according to two bank officials. In meetings in recent months, a Deutsche Bank management committee that oversees reputational and other risks for the lender in the Americas region has discussed ways in which it could rid the bank of these last vestiges of the relationship, two of the three bank officials said. The bank has over the years lent Trump more than $2 billion, one of the officials said. One idea that has come up in the meetings: Sell the loans in the secondary market, two of the bank officials said. But one of the officials said that idea has not gained traction, in part because it is not clear who would want to buy the loans and the attendant problems that come with it. While it was known that Deutsche Bank has been closely examining its relationship with Trump, including by setting up a working group in 2016 to review the bank's relationship with him, its recent eagerness to end all ties and the contours of discussions in light of the election have not been previously reported. Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. Warren's warningThe German bank, which first started lending to Trump in the late 1990s, has been dragged into congressional and other investigations into the real estate mogul-turned-politician's finances and alleged Russia connections. The probes and the bad press, seen by one senior executive as ""serious collateral damage"" from the relationship, are an unwelcome distraction for the bank, the three officials said. It comes at a time when chief executive Christian Sewing is trying to turn Deutsche Bank around after its decades-long run at becoming a major Wall Street bank left it nursing huge losses. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat member of the Senate banking committee, has previously called for an investigation into Deutsche Bank over its money laundering controls and has demanded answers from the lender about its relationship with Trump and his family. She told Reuters that she intended to keep pushing for a probe in the next administration. ""You bet I'm going to continue to fight for accountability and strong enforcement of our banking laws, especially for giant institutions like Deutsche Bank,"" she said. What happens next for the bank rests on the outcome of Tuesday's elections, according to the three bank officials. If the Republican president loses, and Democrats take control of the White House and Congress, senior Deutsche Bank executives believe congressional investigations that have stalled amid a court battle over access to Trump's financial records could be rejuvenated, the three bank officials said. In this scenario, however, Deutsche Bank executives believe they will also have more freedom to deal with the loans and end their relationship with Trump, the officials said. They hope doing so might help reduce some of the scrutiny, they said. Different scenariosThe loans, which are against Trump's golf course in Miami, and hotels in Washington and Chicago, are such that the Trump Organization has only had to pay interest on them so far, and the entire principal is outstanding, two of the three bank officials said. They come due in 2023 and 2024, the filings show. The businesses backing the loans face challenges. The coronavirus-driven economic slowdown has hit the travel industry, including hotels. Moreover, last month Reuters reported that Trump's plan to make money by developing houses and hotels on his golf courses, including the one involving the Deutsche Bank loan, had not panned out so far. The Deutsche Bank executives are not unduly concerned about Trump's ability to repay the loans, given the president's personal guarantees and the time left before they come due, the three bank officials said. If Trump is not in office, Deutsche Bank executives feel that it would be easier for them to demand repayment, foreclose if he is not able to pay it off or refinance, or try to sell the loans, according to two of the three bank officials. Since Trump has personally guaranteed all the loans, Deutsche Bank could also seize the president's assets if he is unable to repay, two of the three bank officials said. If Trump wins a second term, Deutsche Bank executives feel their options would be fewer, the three bank officials said. The bank wouldn't want the negative publicity inherent with seizing assets from a sitting president and would likely extend the loans until he is out of office, two of the bank officials said. The bottom line, the three bank officials said, is that the matter wonât be resolved until well after the election. "
"NEW DELHI: From Donald Trump asserting that India and the United States could reach a ""tremendous"" trade deal to him complaining about high import tariffs on American motorcycles, there have been a series of developments between the two nations under the Trump administration. The most recent and significant one (of course after H-1B visa) will remain Harley Davidson's decision to shut down its only India factory and enter into a partnership with India's Hero MotorCorp, a tried and tested move which has already been adopted by global players such as BMW, KTM and Triumph. Here's how trade ties between the world's two largest democracies unfolded under Trump:* Trump admin and recent H-1B changes: The US government has been made several changes to the H-1B visa programme, which has hurt Indian professionals the most. The Trump administration has issued two interim final rules (IFRs) relating to the H-1B visa program (skilled worker visa), which significantly raise wage parameters and tighten eligibility norms by narrowing certain definitions ranging from âspeciality occupationâ to âemployer-employee relationshipâ. New definitions such as third-party worksite have been incorporated. The fraud detection force has also got more teeth to conduct site visits and monitor compliance before, during, and after an H-1B petition (application) is approved. But, the biggest blow to the IT Services sectors is that the new rules limit the H-1B visa tenure, where the employees are to be placed at third-party client sites to a maximum of one-year, from the current maximum tenure of three-years. US giants such as Apple, Google, Microsoft are among the 46 companies to have lent support to a lawsuit against the new policies issued by the US Department of Labour (DOL) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), relating to the H-1B program. Others include social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. 46 companies to file an amicus brief against H-1B interim final rules  * Visa ban: In June, Trump had issued an executive order that had put temporary bar on issuing of new H-1B and other foreign visas including H-2B, J and L visas, till the end of the year. The US president had argued that the America needs to save and protect jobs for its domestic work force at a time when millions of them lost their jobs due to coronavirus pandemic. Later, a federal judge blocked the enforcement of the H-1B visa ban issued by Trump, saying the president exceeded his constitutional authority. US judge blocks Donald Trump's H-1B visa ban* Trump and Harley: Trump has time and again complained about high import tariffs levied by India on American motorcycles. Even as India had slashed customs duty on imported motorcycles from high-end brands such as Harley-Davidson to 50 per cent from 100 per cent earlier, Trump stated that it was too high and unacceptable. High duties on large engine motorcycles raised their prices and made it too expensive for consumers in India. To make the bikes more affordable, an assembly plant was built in India. However, the brand didn't capture a majority portion of the Indian market. Then, the American bike maker decided to shut its India factory and partner India's Hero MotorCorp to run business in the country. Return journey: Harley hops on Hero Moto for India ride* Trump's India visit: Days ahead of his India visit in February, the US president had said that the two countries could make a ""tremendous"" trade deal. He had also said that ""saving the big deal"" with India for later and he ""does not know"" if it will be done before the presidential election in November. Will make tremendous trade deal with India: Donald Trump* Growth of India-US trade: The US remains India's top trading partner in terms of goods and services, followed by China. Goods dominate the bilateral trade between the US and India - approximately 62 per cent while it is 38 per cent in services. According to the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF) report, the overall growth rate in cumulative bilateral trade for the first three quarters of 2019 (January-September) was down to 4.5 per cent from 8.4 per cent registered for the first two quarters. The year 2019 saw the US export $34.3 billion worth of goods and services to India, another set of data showed. On the other hand, it imported $57.7 billion worth of goods and services from India, up 5 per cent from the previous year's $54.3 billion level. The US goods trade deficit with India stood at $23.4 billion in 2019. "
"WASHINGTON: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell all but shut the door Wednesday on President Donald Trump's push for $2,000 Covid-19 relief checks, declaring Congress has provided enough pandemic aid as he blocked another attempt by Democrats to force a vote. The GOP leader made clear he is unwilling to budge, despite political pressure from Trump and even some fellow Republican senators demanding action. Trump wants the recent $600 in aid increased threefold. But McConnell dismissed the idea of bigger ""survival checks"" approved by the House, saying the money would go to plenty of American households that just don't need it. McConnell's refusal to act means the additional relief Trump wanted is all but dead. ""We just approved almost a trillion dollars in aid a few days ago,"" McConnell said, referring to the year-end package Trump signed into law. McConnell added, ""if specific, struggling households still need more help,"" the Senate will consider ""smart targeted aid. Not another firehose of borrowed money."" The showdown between the outgoing president and his own Republican Party over the $2,000 checks has thrown Congress into a chaotic year-end session just days before new lawmakers are set to be sworn into office. It's one last standoff, together with the override of Trump's veto of a sweeping defense bill, that will punctuate the president's final days and deepen the GOP's divide between its new wing of Trump-styled populists and what had been mainstay conservative views against government spending. Trump has been berating the GOP leaders, and tweeted, ""$2000 ASAP!"" President-elect Joe Biden also supports the payments and wants to build on what he calls a ""downpayment"" on relief. ""In this moment of historic crisis and untold economic pain for countless American families, the President-elect supports $2,000 direct payments as passed by the House,"" said Biden transition spokesman Andrew Bates. The roadblock set by Senate Republicans appears insurmountable. Most GOP senators seemed to accept the inaction even as a growing number of Republicans, including two senators in runoff elections on Jan. 5 in Georgia, agree with Trump's demand, some wary of bucking him. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the $600 checks would begin to go out Wednesday. Congress had settled on smaller payments in a compromise over the big, year-end COVID relief and government funding bill that Trump reluctantly signed into law. Before signing, though, Trump demanded more. For a second day in a row, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tried to force a vote on the bill approved by the House meeting Trump's demand for the $2,000 checks. ""What we're seeing right now is Leader McConnell trying to kill the checks - the $2,000 checks desperately needed by so many American families,"" Schumer said. With the Georgia Senate runoff elections days away, leading Republicans warned that the GOP's refusal to provide more aid as the virus worsens could jeopardize the outcome of those races. Georgia's GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are trying to fend off Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in runoff elections that will determine which party has the Senate majority. The two Republicans announced support for Trump's call for more generous checks. ""The Senate Republicans risk throwing away two seats and control of the Senate,"" Newt Gingrich, the former congressional leader, said on Fox News. McConnell has tried to shield his divided Republicans from a difficult vote. On Wednesday he suggested he had kept his word to start a ""process"" to address Trump's demands, even if it means no votes will actually be taken. ""It's no secret Republicans have a diversity of views,"" he said. Earlier, McConnell had unveiled a new bill loaded up with Trump's other priorities as a possible off-ramp for the stalemate. It included the $2,000 checks more narrowly targeted to lower-income households as well as a complicated repeal of protections for tech companies like Facebook or Twitter under Section 230 of a communications law that the president complained is unfair to conservatives. It also tacked on the establishment of a bipartisan commission to review the 2020 presidential election Trump lost to President-elect Joe Biden. If McConnell sets a vote on his bill, it could revive Trump's priorities. But because the approach contains the additional tech and elections provisions, Democrats and some Republicans will likely balk and it's unlikely to have enough support in Congress to pass. No additional votes on Covid aid have been scheduled at this point. For McConnell, the procedural moves allowed him to check the box over the commitments he made when Trump was defiantly refusing to sign off on the big year-end package last weekend. ""That was a commitment, and that's what happened,"" he said. Liberal senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who support the relief boost are blocking action on a defense bill until a vote can be taken on Trump's demand for $2,000 for most Americans. Sanders thundered on the floor that McConnell should call his own constituents in the GOP leader's home state of Kentucky ""and find out how they feel about the need for immediate help in terms of a $2,000 check."" Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida, among the party's potential 2024 presidential hopefuls, also pushed in the president's direction. Hawley is also leading Trump's challenge Jan. 6 to the Electoral College result tally in Congress. Other Republicans panned the bigger checks, arguing during a lively Senate debate that the nearly $400 billion price tag was too high, the relief is not targeted to those in need and Washington has already dispatched ample sums on COVID aid. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., tweeted that ""blindly borrowing"" billions ""so we can send $2,000 checks to millions of people who haven't lost any income is terrible policy."" Considered a longshot, Trump's demand gained momentum at the start of the week when dozens of House Republicans calculated it was better to link with most Democrats than defy the outgoing president. They helped pass a bill raising the payments with a robust two-thirds vote of approval. As Trump's push fizzles out, his attempt to amend the year-end package - $900 billion in Covid-19 aid and $1.4 trillion to fund government agencies through September - will linger as potentially one last confrontation before the new Congress is sworn in Sunday. The Covid-19 portion of the bill revives a weekly pandemic jobless benefit boost - this time $300, through March 14 - as well as the popular Paycheck Protection Program of grants to businesses to keep workers on payrolls. It extends eviction protections, adding a new rental assistance fund. Americans earning up to $75,000 will qualify for the direct $600 payments, which are phased out at higher income levels, and there's an additional $600 payment per dependent child. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trumpâs finances and business dealings are under intense scrutiny, and his re-election prospects are in danger, after bombshell disclosures that the self-proclaimed billionaire president paid a measly each $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. Trump rejected revelations in the New York Times as âfake newsâ without denying specific items or numbers cited, while claiming he had paid millions of dollars in taxes and raging against the newspaper and the Internal Revenue Service that is auditing his finances. ""It's totally fake news. Made up,"" Trump said at a White House briefing before turning around and walking away from questions after complaining that the IRS had treated him ""very badly."" But the investigative report, more of which NYT said would be be rolled out in the coming days, laid bare what has long been suspected and speculated: The US President has been a spectacular failure as a businessmen and has a mountain of debt that could make him vulnerable to pressure. In fact, the report suggested that Trumpâs run for the White House in 2016 was aimed at reinvigorating his brand and clearing debts rather than winning, which no one expected him to. Some analysts went so far as to argue that Trumpâs debts presents a national security threat, pointing to the disclosure that upwards of $300 million in loans for which he is personally responsible, and nearly $421 million in overall debt, will become due in the next four years. In fact, the disclosures show that Trump paid more in taxes on revenues from licensing agreements for properties bearing his name in India than he did to the United States. During his first two years as president, Trump received $73 million from foreign operations, which in addition to his golf properties in Scotland and Ireland included $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey. The president in 2017 paid $145,400 in taxes in India and $156,824 in the Philippines, compared to just $750 in US income taxes. ""Due to his indebtedness, his reliance on income from overseas and his refusal to authentically distance himself from his hodgepodge of business, Trump represents a profound national security threat â a threat that will only escalate if heâs re-elected. The tax returns also show the extent to which Trump has repeatedly betrayed the interests of many of the average Americans who elected him and remain his most loyal supporters,"" Bloomberg Opinion columnist Timothy OâBrien wrote. Other analysts said Trump has been a walking conflict of interest from the time he ran for President, considering the extent of his business dealings, including overseas dealings. Calls for the Presidentâs resignation and hashtags of #LockHimUp, #Trumpisbroke and #FakePresident went up on social media as the NYT report exposed Trumpâs alleged financial shenanigans, including taking a $70,000 write-off for haircuts and routing money to his daughter Ivanka Trump in one dodgy transaction. In 2017, Trumpâs private records show that his company once paid $747,622 in fees to an unnamed consultant. That same year Ivanka Trumpâs public disclosure forms show she received $747,622 through a consulting company she co-owned. The Presidentâs alleged tax capers generated outrage in political circles amid the countryâs struggle with the pandemic. There were derisive references to he tax deductions he claimed, even as struggling workaday people disclosed they had paid more than $750 in taxes on their modest wages. ""In 2016 & â17, I paid thousands of dollars a year in taxes *as a bartender.* Trump paid $750. He contributed less to funding our communities than waitresses & undocumented immigrants. Donald Trump has never cared for our country more than he cares for himself. A walking scam,"" tweeted Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who was trolled by Trump supporters for treating herself to a $250 hairstyling on her birthday last year. ""Whereâs the criticism of their idol spending $70k on hairstyling? Oh, itâs nowhere because theyâre spineless, misogynistic hypocrites? Got it,"" she added. And from Democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders: ""Shock of shocks! Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, received a $72.9 million tax refund from the IRS while not paying a nickel in federal income taxes in 10 out of 15 years. Yep. Trump l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for everyone else."" Trump has long resisted calls to disclose his income tax returns â as all Presidential candidates do as part of the norms and conventions â arguing that he will do so once the IRS audit is finished, although there is no rule preventing him from opening the books during an audit. According to the NYT report, starting in 2010, Trump claimed, and received, an income tax refund totaling $72.9 million â all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005-08, plus interest. The legitimacy of that refund is at the center of a years-long audit battle with the IRS. Trumpâs dodginess on taxes is not new. Taunted by Hillary Clinton during he 2016 race that perhaps he was not releasing his tax returns because he had paid nothing, Trump interrupted her to say, ""That makes me smart."" "
"NEW DELHI: Donald J Trump, the flamboyant US President, is an unconventional leader by all standards with his tenure in White House marked with impulsive foreign policy decisions, off the cuff remarks, fiery rhetoric, racial tension and economic slowdown in America and numerous alleged scandals. Donald Trump is the 45th and current president of the United States. Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015 with his slogan ""Make America Great Again."" He defeated Hillary Clinton to become president, without ever holding political office previously.  He assumed office on January 20, 2017, and filed to run for re-election on the same day. He crossed the delegate threshold necessary to win the Republican nomination--1,276 delegates--on March 17, 2020. He was formally nominated at the Republican National Convention on August 24, 2020.  Donald Trump was born in New York City in 1946. He attended Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, according to the White House website. After that, he started working for his father's business and eventually founded the Trump Organization, which is comprised of 500 companies involving resorts, hotels, residential properties and more.  In the 1980s, he invested in the casino business in Atlantic City. Trump launched the reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" in 2004. It ran for 15 seasons.  He does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes, linking his abstinence to the loss of his older brother, who struggled with alcoholism and died in 1981 at the age of 43, according to Kyodo News. He instead loves fast food and prefers to drink Diet Coke.  Trump married his first wife, Ivana, in 1977 and the couple had three children: Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. They divorced in 1992 and the following year, his new wife, Marla Maples, gave birth to their daughter Tiffany. Trump has been married to Melania Knauss since 2005. They have a son together named Barron.  Trump is known for using social media, especially Twitter, to issue directives, to rants about political leaders, world leaders and occasionally his administration officials. New York Times reported that Trump has fully integrated Twitter into the very fabric of his administration, reshaping the nature of the presidency and presidential power.  In 2019, he announced increased tariffs on USD 300 billion worth of Chinese goods, using a tweet to deepen tensions between the two countries. And in March that year, Trump cast aside more than 50 years of American policy, tweeting his recognition of Israel's sovereignty in the Golan Heights.  In December last year, Trump became the third US President in history to be impeached by the House of Representatives when it brought accusations that he abused the power of his office to boost his own chances of re-election. He was acquitted at a subsequent trial in the Republican-controlled Senate.  In his re-election bid, President Trump has been focusing on his stewardship of the economy, promising a rapid coronavirus vaccine, and employing tough rhetoric on immigration and social unrest.  According to Trump's campaign website, his administration's policies generated 6 million new jobs, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest point in 50 years and wages grew. He also boasts about GDP growth.""There are more than a million more job openings than unemployed persons in the US,"" the website says.  As the President of the US, Trump is facing the most dangerous crisis of this century as coronavirus spreads and the country's economy is witnessing a slowdown.  Trump administration handling of coronavirus pandemic has become the flashpoint in his race against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The former vice president has focused his campaign against Trump on the administration's failure to combat the crisis.  The US is the worst COVID-19 impacted country in the world with its death toll exceeding over 2.3 lakh. Trump was also tested positive for COVID-19 and this impacted his campaign as he was downplaying the impact of the pandemic since its inception.  Trump's foreign policy has remained controversial and unconventional. In the four years, he withdrew from the Paris Accord, Iran nuclear deal, and rescinded Cuba deal.  Trump has also witnessed a few successes on the foreign front. Last month, the UAE, Bahrain becomes the third and fourth Arab country after Egypt and Jordan to have a Peace Treaty with Israel that was brokered by the US.  Trump had announced his intention not only to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians but also to resolve the century-long conflict between the Jews and the Arabs.  Trump last week also announced about a deal between Israel and Sudan in a televised three-way conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the president of Sudan's Sovereignty Council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.In February, the US and Taliban signed Afghan peace deal paving way for intra-Afghan negotiations between the terrorist group and the Afghan government to restore peace in the war-torn country. On September 12, the much-awaited intra-Afghan talks between the Taliban and the Afghan High Council for National Reconciliation opened in Doha, Qatar. Though the violence continues and even appears to be escalating, experts still believe as talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government will bear fruits.  Trump administration has also given special emphasis on the US relations with India. It is visible by the fact that just days before the elections, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper arrived in India for 2+2 talks.  Though US relations with few countries have strengthened, faultlines deepen with other countries like China and Iran. Trump administration pulled out of the famous Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and imposed multiple sanctions on Iran. Against that backdrop of heightened tensions, Trump authorised a drone strike that killed Iran's top military leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, as he arrived in Baghdad. The killing of Soleimbrought the two nations on the brink of war.  China has emerged as an important issue of the 2020 US elections. Donald Trump's aggressive approach to China has helped create a trade war more virulent than any seen in decades. He has also blamed China for spreading the coronavirus around the world.  Trump's first major trade actions against China came in January 2018, when he slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, according to Channel News Asia. The US-China trade war entered its first reciprocal phase between April and December 2018, as Washington and Beijing began a series of tit-for-tat exchanges.  A detente came in December when both countries agreed to suspend new tariffs and begin talks. This respite was not to last. In May 2019, after Xi backtracked on the newly negotiated agreement, Trump raised US tariffs to 25 per cent on US$200 billion of Chinese goods.  On the domestic front, the United States under Trump has been facing protests over one or the other issue. At the beginning of his administration, people hit the streets after the president imposed a travel ban on Muslims countries and pushed ahead with his plans to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.  The violent protests have rocked the American cities after the killing of a black man George Floyd in police custody in May.  In cities across the United States, tens of thousands of people have swarmed the streets to express their outrage and sorrow during the day. That has descended into nights of unrest, with reports of shootings, looting and vandalism in some cities.  Trump had his share of scandals too that has surely impacted his campaign so far.  Most recent is Trump's niece Mary Trump's book in which she has made some shocking claims about the US leader, calling him a ""narcissist"", a university cheat, a bully and someone who once complimented his niece's breasts.  White House has rejected the claims made in the tell-all memoir.  President Trump's longtime lawyer and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, has alleged in a new book that Trump made ""overt and covert attempts to get Russia to interfere in the 2016 election"" and that the future commander in chief was also well aware of Cohen's hush-money payoff to adult-film star Stormy Daniels during that campaign.  Cohen laid out an alarming portrait of the constellation of characters orbiting around Trump, likening the arrangement to the mafia and calling himself ""one of Trump's bad guys."" He describes the president, meanwhile, as ""a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.""White House has attacked Cohen's credibility, saying he is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress, Washington Post reported.  At least 24 women have accused the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, of inappropriate sexual behaviour in multiple incidents spanning the last 30 years.  Americans will vote today to elect their next president, either giving Trump another four years or handing over the keys to the White House to Biden. "
"LONDON: The 2020 US election is shaping up to be the biggest betting event of all time, with one player placing a record-breaking one million-pound bet on a victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden, betting companies say. People were still rushing to place bets on the eve of Tuesday's election and Matthew Shaddick, Head of Politics Betting at Ladbrokes Coral Group, said it estimated about one billion pounds would be wagered globally across the industry. US President Donald Trump's chances of re-election gained slightly over the weekend, but Biden remained a clear favourite in online betting markets. Betters on British exchange Smarkets give Biden a 65% chance of winning, while Trump's prospects improved to 35% from 34%. UK-based internet Betfair Exchange said it also saw Trump's odds improve on the same level. One person had placed a one million-pound ($1.3 million) bet on Biden, Betfair said, the biggest political bet of all time. If Biden wins, the player would bag 1.54 million pounds. The former vice-president has a substantial lead in national opinion polls, although the contest is slightly closer in battleground states likely to decide the race. ""Florida is one where the polls suggest Biden is the more likely winner, but the (betting) markets have Trump as favourite,"" Shaddick said. ""The GOP have tended to overperform the polls quite regularly in that state."" The election is on track to be by far the biggest betting event, with 271 million pounds bet so far, Betfair said. It accepts bets right up until the result is announced and sees bets with it to hit the 400 million pound mark, double that of 2016. Most of the big-money betting occurs outside the United States as betting on politics is illegal there. "
"WASHINGTON: A worrying new variant of Covid-19 was detected for the first time Tuesday in the United States and Latin America as President-elect Joe Biden vowed he will significantly ramp up a fledging vaccination drive. The new strain, which first emerged in the UK, pushed Britain to a new daily record of coronavirus infections and led South Africa to impose a raft of new measures, amid fears around the world that holiday revelers are aggravating the spike in infections. The EU health agency warned that the strain carried a high risk for more hospitalizations and deaths -- not because the infections are more severe but because it spreads more easily. The Rocky Mountain state of Colorado recorded what is believed to be the first case in the United States -- which has suffered the highest death toll of the year-old pandemic that has claimed more than 1.78 million lives globally. Governor Jared Polis said a man in his 20s in Elbert County near Denver was infected with the variant known as B.1.1.7 and is isolating. Biden, after receiving a briefing from experts on the pandemic, warned that the dire Covid situation may not ease up until ""well into March."" ""The next few weeks and months are going to be very tough -- a very tough period for our nation, maybe the toughest during this entire pandemic,"" Biden said in Delaware. Covid hospitalizations are back at an all-time high in the United States at more than 121,000 as of Monday. In Los Angeles, ambulances have waited all day to unload Covid patients, with more than 95 percent of hospitals forced to divert new cases away, and one reportedly treating patients in its gift shop and chapel. Southern California extended a three-week old lockdown indefinitely Tuesday. Biden called mass Covid vaccination the ""greatest operational challenge we've ever faced as a nation"" -- and promised the United States would do better after he replaces defeated President Donald Trump on January 20. ""The Trump administration's plan to distribute vaccines is falling far behind,"" Biden said, promising: ""I'm going to move Heaven and Earth to get us going in the right direction."" The Trump administration had predicted that 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by the end of December. With days left, some 2.1 million have received the first shot of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump defended his record on Twitter, saying that the federal government helped quickly develop vaccines but that it was up to individual states to distribute them. Biden renewed his promise to administer 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office and confirmed he would invoke a Korean War-era law to force private industry to step up production. ""We're planning a whole-of-government effort and we're going to work to set up vaccination sites and send mobile units to hard-to-reach communities,"" Biden said. With health workers desperately waiting, politicians have been among first to be vaccinated in a stated goal of setting an example, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris taking her first dose Tuesday before cameras in Washington. As conspiracy theories spread on the internet, a new poll by Ipsos Global Advisor showed that just four in 10 people in France want to get vaccinated, a figure that is only slightly higher in Russia and South Africa. Britain's government came under pressure to tighten restrictions as it announced a record 24-hour high of 53,135 new infections. Critical care doctor Samantha Batt-Rawden said medical staff were at ""breaking point."" ""We are incredibly thin on the ground. NHS (National Health Service) staff have not been prioritized for the vaccine and are going off sick in droves with the new strain,"" she tweeted. In South Africa, which has recorded more than 300 cases of the new variant and is the first African nation to hit one million cases, the government banned the sale of alcohol and made masks compulsory in public. ""We have let down our guard, and unfortunately we are now paying the price,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa, blaming the new strain and an ""extreme lack of vigilance over the holiday period"" for the spike. Chile on Tuesday became the first Latin American country to detect the new strain, in a woman who returned there from Madrid after also traveling to Britain and Dubai. Health authorities responded by announcing that from December 31, everyone arriving in Chile would have to spend 10 days in quarantine. The new strain was also detected in the United Arab Emirates and India, which has the second-biggest caseload in the world. Worrisome trends have been increasing worldwide, with South Korea -- hailed for its early success -- logging its highest daily death toll since the beginning of the pandemic. And Moscow health officials reported a 27 percent increase in fatalities in the capital from October to November -- a day after Russia admitted its number of Covid-19 deaths were more than three times higher than it had previously reported. "
"WASHINGTON: US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will receive a Covid-19 vaccine live on television on Tuesday, as the incoming Biden administration seeks to boost confidence in the inoculation even while warning it will be months before it is generally available. Senator Harris, who is Black and Asian-American, will become the second high-profile person from an ethnic minority background to receive the vaccine after Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Dec. 18. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he will make the fight against the coronavirus, which has infected more than 19 million Americans and killed over 334,000, his top priority. He received his first injected dose of the vaccine live on television last week. Two doses are required for full protection. The Biden team has put particular emphasis on the importance of encouraging vaccine distribution and inoculation in non-white groups especially hard hit by the coronavirus. Biden is scheduled to give an update on the pandemic in Wilmington, Delaware, later on Tuesday after a briefing with his Covid-19 advisory team and warn that infection rates and the number of deaths are expected to increase in coming weeks, an official from his transition team said. ""He will be truthful and straightforward with the American people about what lies ahead, and will address the current administration falling short on its pace for vaccinations. He will also lay out his plan to get people vaccinated as quickly as possible,â the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Outgoing Republican President Donald Trump, who had Covid-19 in October, frequently has played down the severity of the pandemic and overseen a response many health experts say was disorganized, cavalier and sometimes ignored the science behind disease transmission. Biden will inherit the logistical challenges of distributing the vaccine to hundreds of millions of Americans, as well as the task of persuading people who worry its development was rushed to take it. Biden and his team have warned the vaccine will take time to roll out to the general population and urged people to listen to the advice of medical experts to avoid infection by the coronavirus. Dr. Atul Gawande, a member of Biden's Covid-19 advisory board, told CBS News the transition team still did not have all the information it needed to understand the bottlenecks hampering vaccine distribution. He warned that the Trump administration may have set unrealistic expectations that everyone who wanted to get vaccinated could do so by the end of June 2021. ""The realistic picture is to expect it could be fall before ... enough people are being vaccinated that we're getting back to normal and that it might be summer before the general public is really accessing the vaccine,"" he said. Other Biden transition officials have echoed such caution. Dr. Vivek Murthy, Biden's pick for surgeon general, told NBC News last week that while it was possible that people in lower-risk categories would get the vaccine in the late spring, it was more realistic to expect it would be midsummer or early fall before it reached the general population. The United States has so far authorized two Covid-19 vaccines: one developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE and another by Moderna Inc. Other vaccines are being evaluated. Separately on Tuesday, the Republican-controlled US Senate is expected to address whether to increase coronavirus aid checks for Americans to $2,000, a measure approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on Monday after Trump called for the increase. Biden has said he favors the increase from an already approved $600. "
"WASHINGTON: Covid and a traumatic presidential election left the US reeling in 2020, but even with Donald Trump gone and Joe Biden promising to heal the nation there'll be no quick return to normal in 2021. For many in the world's richest country, 2020 was the year that seemed never-ending -- an infinite series of horror movie sequels shaking the economy, politics and society itself. Biden, an old-school Washington politician who believes in traditional US diplomacy and what he refers to as ""decency,"" got elected on a promise to stop the chaos. ""It is time to turn the page,"" he said earlier this month. The shift in mood at the White House after Inauguration Day on January 20 will be remarkable. Out goes the most attention-seeking president imaginable, and in comes a mild-mannered leader who says he seeks ""to lower the temperature."" But Trump clearly has no intention of giving up the limelight -- or allowing the United States to forget the nationalist and populist passions that his administration worked so hard to stoke. His extraordinary decision to deny that he lost the election, more than a month after it happened, is just part one in what he hopes will be yet another Trump-centered drama, possibly culminating with a new presidential run in 2024. And Biden will have another, tougher foe breathing down his neck: Covid-19. Even though vaccines are now coming online, the virus is at its most deadly, killing thousands of Americans a day. It's forecast to get even worse before winter is over. Trump has tried to take credit for the ultra-fast development of the vaccines -- one of the few good news stories of 2020. But it will largely fall to Biden next year to oversee the unprecedented logistical task of getting doses administered across 50 states. And while Trump can blame the catastrophic disruption to the economy on the coronavirus, it will be Biden who finds himself being remembered for what happens during the hoped-for recovery in 2021. With Trump running for a second term, perhaps it was always inevitable that 2020 was going to be a wild year. The rules-breaking Republican began his year with acquittal along party lines in a Senate impeachment trial. Emboldened, he then stormed out onto the reelection trail, holding rally after rally in front of large crowds. The Trump campaign machine was so well-funded and so single-minded that its then manager, Brad Parscale, likened it to the Death Star in ""Star Wars,"" a weapon ready to annihilate everything in its path. The Democrats, meanwhile, began the year eyeing a long, perilous primary season featuring a staggering two dozen candidates. Clearly, Trump fancied his chances. Unemployment was at rock bottom, the stock market at historic highs and in January Trump reached a truce -- which he spun as a huge win -- in his trade war with China. Yes, he was historically unpopular, but what made him reviled by the left, like his anti-immigrant rhetoric, won adoration on the right. He even joked to his crowds that he'd not only win four more years but an unconstitutional extra eight, 12 or more. What no one knew in the first days of the year was that the Covid-19 virus, at first an unknown disease in faraway China, was about to upend the landscape. By the end of January, the Chinese city of Wuhan was under severe lockdown and Trump had stopped travel from China. Yet for months he and many others in the United States did not appear to understand or at least accept what was happening. Trump called Covid the ""invisible enemy."" It was an unseen force which would kill more than 300,000 Americans by mid-December and wreck Trump's entire reelection message of success and strength. Biden, whose campaign rested heavily on his claim to be the safe pair of hands for a crisis-ridden America, will now face the monumental task of steering the country to recovery. He'll do this with Trump sniping from the sidelines and an opposition Republican party which has moved far to the right over the last four years, embracing Trump's scorched earth brand. Biden's own party may also not prove an easy partner, with the Democrats' left wing in no mood to toe the line. Two runoff races in Georgia for the Senate on January 5 will decide who controls the upper house -- and to a large extent how much room Biden will have to manoeuvre Yet Biden, 78, has insisted he goes into this new era hopeful. As he said in August, accepting the Democratic nomination: ""History will be able to say that the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight."" "
"WASHINGTON: US President-elect Joe Biden on Sunday said that his country is facing ""four historic crises at once"", adding that his team is work working hard to tackle the time-bound challenges. ""From Covid-19 and the economy to climate change and racial justice -- our nation is facing four historic crises at once. And come January, there will be no time to waste. That's why my team and I are hard at work preparing to take action on day one,"" Biden tweeted. Hours after Biden's tweet, President Trump officially signed the trillion dollar coronavirus relief and government spending bill, The Hill reported. On Saturday, Biden had accused Donald Trump of ""abdicating responsibility"" and had pressed the outgoing President to immediately sign the COVID-19 relief bill that was pending. ""It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don't know if they'll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump's refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,"" Biden said in a statement. Members of both parties had urged Trump to sign the USD 2.3 trillion packages, The Hill reported. Earlier, the bill was passed with bipartisan support in US Congress. Earlier today, top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the United States is headed for the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the upcoming weeks as Americans will see the effects of the holiday season. ""The reason I'm concerned and my colleagues in public health are concerned also is that we very well might see a post-seasonal, in the sense of Christmas, New Year's, surge,"" CNN quoted Fauci as saying. ""We are really at a very critical point.... So I share the concern of President-elect Biden that as we get into the next few weeks, it might actually get worse,"" Fauci added. President-elect Biden last week had said that ""darkest days"" against coronavirus ""are ahead of us, not behind us."" The Covid-19 case total in the United States surpassed 19 million-mark on Sunday (local time), according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University, which tracks and compiles data from various sources including local authorities and media outlets. As of 6:35 IST on Monday, Johns Hopkins University had registered 19,107,675 positive tests for the coronavirus disease in the United States. The country's death toll, at the same time, stood at 333,069. "
"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump will accept the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election, the White House said on Thursday, a day after the Republican president drew criticism for refusing to commit to accepting those results. ""The president will accept the results of a free and fair election,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at a news briefing when pressed on Trump's comments on Wednesday, which prompted fellow Republicans in Congress to convey support for a peaceful transition of power. "
"WASHINGTON: Unemployment aid lapsed this weekend for millions of Americans as the country's departing President played golf, complained that fashion magazines discriminated against his wife, and continued his tirade against an election his own party says he lost. The political gridlock in Washington, caused mainly by the President and the fiscally conservative wing of the Republican Party, meant Americans were denied even the $600 stimulus aid in addition to $300-a-week unemployment relief contained in a spending bill that Trump himself shafted while demanding a $2000 payment, which is supported by Democrats. But the domestic economic crisis arising from the Republican wrangle, which could also cause millions of Americans to lose their homes from the lapsing of an eviction moratorium, took a backseat to more frivolous issues. Trump relayed a rightwing news outlet's complaint that ""elitist snobs in the fashion press have kept the most elegant First Lady in American history off the covers of their magazines for 4 consecutive years,"" adding the First Lady is the ""greatest of all time"" and berating ""fake news"" for ignoring her. That invited a cascade of ridicule from critics who derided her qualifications or lack of it, and reveled in the fact that former First Lady Michelle Obama -- who was subjected to racist taunts by white supremacists -- featured a dozen times on the cover of fashion magazines. ""In 26 days we will have a First Lady, a President, a Doctor, a real human couple, and dogs in the White House,"" read one tweet in response to Trump's complaint. The outgoing President's critics also torched him for going on vacation and playing golf while millions of Americans are heading into a dark winter with no financial aid because of the impasse in Washington. Although the President's aides claimed he was holding multiple official meetings while at his home in Mar-a-Lago in Florida, photos emerged of the President, his belly hanging over his belt, golfing on Friday. By one count, trump has hit the golf course more than 300 times during his four-year Presidency slated to end on January 20. Trump though is suggesting that he will not leave without a fight, tweeting ""History will remember. Never give up. See everyone in D.C. on January 6th."" That is the day a joint session of Congress presided over by the vice-president is scheduled to formally count electoral votes from the states and declare a new President elected. Since states have already certified that Joe Biden has 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232, the event would normally be a formality, but Trump proxies are expected to create a scene with objections claiming the election was rigged. ""A young military man working in Afghanistan told me that elections in Afghanistan are far more secure and much better run than the USAâs 2020 Election. Ours, with its millions and millions of corrupt Mail-In Ballots, was the election of a third world country. Fake President!"" Trump tweeted on Saturday morning, continuing his tirade against an election process he accepted when it threw him up as the winner in 2016, despite the fact he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million. ""The U.S. Supreme Court has been totally incompetent and weak on the massive Election Fraud that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election. We have absolute PROOF, but they donât want to see it - No âstandingâ, they say. If we have corrupt elections, we have no country!"" he added, despite his campaign having failed to make a case for his win in dozens of cases it filed in lower courts, many of which were summarily thrown out even by judges he and his administration had appointed. The defeated President railed against his own party and administration while making the case that he had won to a dwindling number of supporters. ""The âJusticeâ Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest SCAM in our nationâs history, despite overwhelming evidence. They should be ashamed...If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the Republicans do NOTHING, just want to let it pass. NO FIGHT!"" he complained. Trump also characterized ""the $740 defense bill"" (he forgot the billion) as ""a gift to China, Russia & Big Tech,"" even though it was forged by his administration and cleared by Republican grandees. ""It fails to terminate the internationally dangerous Section 230, wonât allow us to bring our troops back home (where they belong), renames & destroys our forts & National Monuments, & makes 5G almost impossible!"" he added. "
"PALM BEACH, Fla/WASHINGTON: Millions of Americans saw their jobless benefits expire on Saturday after U.S. President Donald Trump refused to sign into law a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, protesting that it did not do enough to help everyday people. Trump stunned Republicans and Democrats alike when he said this week he was unhappy with the massive bill, which provides $892 billion in badly needed coronavirus relief, including extending special unemployment benefits expiring on Dec. 26, and $1.4 trillion for normal government spending. Without Trump's signature, about 14 million people could lose those extra benefits, according to Labor Department data. A partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday unless Congress can agree a stop-gap government funding bill before then. After months of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats agreed to the package last weekend, with the support of the White House. Trump, who hands over power to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, did not object to terms of the deal before Congress voted it through on Monday night. But since then he has complained that the bill gives too much money to special interests, cultural projects and foreign aid, while its one-time $600 stimulus checks to millions of struggling Americans were too small. He has demanded that be raised to $2,000. ""Why would politicians not want to give people $2,000, rather than only $600?...Give our people the money!"" the billionaire president tweeted on Christmas Day, much of which he spent golfing at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Many economists agree the bill's aid is too low but say the immediate support is still welcome and necessary. A source familiar with the situation said Trump's objection to the bill caught many White House officials by surprise. While the outgoing president's strategy for the bill remains unclear, he has not vetoed it and could still sign it in coming days. On Saturday, he was scheduled to remain in Mar-a-Lago, where the bill has been sent and awaits his decision. Biden, whose Nov. 3 electoral victory Trump refuses to acknowledge, is spending the holiday in his home state of Delaware and had no public events scheduled for Saturday. "
"SLIPPERY ROCK: President Donald Trump's campaign has a bold theory for how he will win reelection: It can tap a universe of millions of supporters who did not vote for him in 2016 but will do so this time. Supposedly, these voters are overlooked by polls that show Trump consistently trailing Democrat Joe Biden. They are mostly the white working class from factory towns, farms and mining communities that Trump has elevated to near-mythic status as the ""forgotten Americans."" They are disaffected and disconnected from conventional politics. Yet they flock to the president's rallies, plaster their yards with signs and have been filling up voter registration rolls, the campaign insists. In few places will this strategy be tested as in Pennsylvania, a critical state that Trump carried by only 44,292 votes out of 6.1 million cast in 2016. A Democratic surge of votes in cities and suburbs could quickly erase that narrow lead. To hold onto Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes, the president needs to prove that a hidden groundswell of supporters exists - and will vote. But the math behind the theory is tight. Trump's plan requires blowout victories and historic turnout in conservative strongholds across the state, places where he outperformed traditional Republicans four years ago and he knows must do even better. His mission is made clear by his campaign stops in Pennsylvania this week - a tour through GOP areas like Latrobe, Lititz and Martinsburg, ""Trump has to drive turnout,"" said Terry Madonna, a professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster who has conducted polls in the state for almost three decades. ""I don't see any evidence that he's expanded his base."" The strategy is more difficult to execute given the stunning disruption wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, both in terms of a public health crisis and nationwide economic dislocation. Trump's handling of the virus has cost him support among suburban women and older voters. His response to the civil unrest reacting to police killings of Black men only served to energize the resolve of Black women, as candidates and as voters. His wrecking-ball persona has prompted some of his backers in 2016 to reject him. So his fate lies in large part in places like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, conservative county north of Pittsburgh. There are nearly two Republicans for each registered Democrat. Most adults did not graduate from college. The economy rests on manufacturing and fracking, as well as service-sector jobs from suburbs creeping in from the city. Republican turnout in Butler County was an impressive 80% in 2016. But local Republicans say the goal is to push that number as high as 90% this year. And they've spent several months registering new Republicans, adding 9,043 of them this year alone, for a 12.8% increase. Trump's campaign is trying to replicate those kinds of numbers in other rural and exurban counties in the state. Al Lindsay, a 74-year-old trial lawyer and farmer who leads the Butler County Republicans, says that registration push has been made easy by frustrations over pandemic lockdowns and a growing belief that Democrats don't understand people who are religious and rural. His pitch is simple: ""Look, there's an urgency here. We need you."" Butler wears its industrial past openly. There is still a baseball field at the historic Pullman Park, but the company closed its railcar factory in 1982. Its towns' Main Streets recall an era when America was ascendant. The wire rope that holds up the Brooklyn Bridge was made in Butler County. So was the prototype for the Jeep deployed in World War II. Republicans have been operating three campaign offices in the county - a declaration of their intention to dominate. Slippery Rock Mayor Jondavid Longo pushed to open one of those offices in his town of 3,600. It sits opposite North Country Brewing, the town's second-largest employer after Slippery Rock University, where Longo, a former Marine infantryman, attended college. Longo, 30, was elected mayor of Slippery Rock in 2017 by promising to keep taxes low and attract new businesses. The Republican knocked on 1,000 doors on the premise - similar to Trump's - that the key to winning was finding people who had tired of politics. His suits are tailored, his beard manicured and he drives entrepreneurs through Slippery Rock in a matte white Tesla. Trump ""has given us an energy that says, Don't back down, stand up for what's right,"" Longo said. ""Open your mouth when you feel compelled to do so."" The mayor has aimed to turn out younger voters, a group that normally favors Democrats. But in Butler County, there are almost twice as many Republicans under 35 as there are Democrats - and their perspectives veer from the politics of their peers across the country. "
"WASHINGTON: Conservative jurist Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in as the 115th justice on the US Supreme Court on Monday night, an hour after the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed her nomination, delivering President Donald Trump a landmark win just a week before the crucial presidential election.  The Senate confirmed the nomination of Barrett as the Supreme Court Judge by 52-48 votes, overcoming the unified opposition of Democrats.  Barrett, a 48-year-old religious conservative, was administered the official constitutional oath by Justice Clarence Thomas on the South Lawn of the White House alongside President Trump.  ""I stand here tonight, truly honoured and humbled,"" she said shortly after she took the constitutional oath.  ""This is a momentous day for America, for the United States Constitution and for the fair and impartial rule of law,"" said Trump in his remarks on the occasion.  ""She is one of our nation's most brilliant legal scholars, and she will make an outstanding justice on the highest court in our land,"" he said.  Out of nine Supreme Court Justices, Trump, so far, has nominated three of them.  In the US a Supreme Court justice is appointed for life and does not have a retirement age. Barrett's confirmation creates a 6-3 conservative majority on the court.  ""It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the seat of a true pioneer for women: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Tonight, Justice Barrett becomes not only the fifth woman to serve on our nation's highest court, but the very first mother of school-aged children to become a Supreme Court justice. Very important,"" Trump said.  The opposition Democratic party has decried the Senate for confirming her nomination. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had said that the new judge should have been selected by the winner of the November 3 elections. Trump, however, defended his decision.  ""I want every American child watching to understand that this is a very special and important ceremony. We are fulfilling the duty that passes to each new generation to sustain the national traditions and virtues that make possible everything we have achieved before that we will do tomorrow,"" Trump asserted at the White House.  Grateful for the confidence of the Senate in her, Justice Barrett in her remarks pledge to the American people that she will discharge her duties to the very best of her ability.  ""The confirmation process has made ever clearer to me one of the fundamental differences between the federal judiciary and the United States Senate, and perhaps the most acute is the role of policy preferences,"" she said.  ""It is the job of a senator to pursue her policy preferences. In fact, it would be a dereliction of duty for her to put policy goals aside. By contrast, it is the job of a judge to resist her policy preferences. It would be a dereliction of duty for her to give in to them,"" she added.  Federal judges don't stand for election. Thus, they have no basis for claiming that their preferences reflect those of the people. This separation of duty from political preference is what makes the judiciary distinct among the three branches of government, Barrett said.  ""A judge declares independence not only from Congress and the President, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her. The Judicial Oath captures the essence of the judicial duty the rule of law must always control,"" she said.  Senator and Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris slammed the Republicans for confirming Barrett's nomination a week before the important presidential elections.  ""Today Republicans denied the will of the American people by confirming a Supreme Court justice through an illegitimate process-all in their effort to gut the Affordable Care Act and strip health care from millions with pre-existing conditions,"" she said.  ""Tonight's vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice is a disgrace, not only because of what she will do when she gets on the bench, but because of the entire process, which was pushed through with extraordinary hypocrisy by Senate Republicans in the last days of a president's term,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said.  Eight days from Election Day, after 60 million Americans have already cast their ballots, Trump and the Republican Senate have committed an act of supreme desperation by jamming through a Supreme Court justice - all so that they can achieve their years-long campaign to destroy Americans' health care, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  ""With this usurped Supreme Court seat, the President is ripping away millions of families' health care in the middle of a pandemic that has infected over 8.6 million and killed nearly one-quarter of a million Americans.  ""In her confirmation hearing, Justice Barrett refused to answer whether she believes that Medicare is constitutional. She refused to acknowledge the scientific fact that climate change is happening, saying she isn't a scientist, calling it 'controversial',"" she said.  ""The President's Supreme Court manipulation threatens the very values and rights that define and distinguish our nation: a woman's constitutional right to make her own medical decisions, the rights of LGBTQ Americans, the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain for fair wages, the future of our planet and environmental protections, voting rights and the right of every American to have a voice in our democracy,"" Pelosi said. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump packed up from the White House and left for vacation in Florida on Wednesday, leaving Republican and Democrats lawmakers scrapping on Christmas eve over coronavirus stimulus relief payments to millions of broke and unemployed Americans who face a dreadful finale to 2020, and worse, an uncertain 2021. The unreal spectacle of Republican lawmakers blocking Trump's proposal for $2000 stimulus payments for Americans and Democrats supporting it is playing out in Washington in the closing days of a traumatic year, with promise of more pain the coming days. If lawmakers cannot arrive at a deal soon, unemployment benefits for 14 million Americans will expire on Saturday, and an eviction moratorium protecting some 30 million Americans from being turfed out of rental properties will end on December 31. The federal government itself will shutdown on December 28 midnight if lawmakers do not approve an extension in funding. âToday, on Christmas Eve morning, House Republicans cruelly deprived the American people of the $2,000 that the President agreed to support,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday as lawmakers hung on in Washington DC for political skirmishes ahead of the biggest holiday week of the year. âIf the President is serious about the $2,000 direct payments, he must call on House Republicans to end their obstruction.â But Trump headed off for holidays to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida amid uncertainty whether he would even return to the White House, which is emptying out fast even as he insists he won a second term, something even the Republican leadership now acknowledges is not true. Whether the party dumps Trump or Trump breaks the party will become clear in the next few days now that the establishment GOP has virtually accepted the imminence of a Biden presidency. In a typical Inauguration Day transfer of power, the outgoing President and spouse welcome the newly-elected president and First Lady for tea at the White House, an Oval Office meeting, and a shared ride from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue up to the Capitol for the oath taking ceremony at noon. That looks off the table now given Trump's intransigence on not recognizing a Biden victory, with Covid-19 fears providing cover for bailing out of the established routine. Still, there are signs that Trump will leave the White House once Congress formally certifies election results during a joint session on January 6, which presents the President a last chance to torpedo the results. Earlier this week, administration officials issued directions to White House staffers on how to pack up from their jobs and offices before abruptly withdrawing the memo. The memo informed them about when they would receive their final paycheck and when they would have to clear out their office and exit the White House. It also included housekeeping details such as cleaning the office microwave and refrigerator, returning Presidential gifts, and boxing up office supplies and things to take home. The approximately 55,000-sq foot White House itself is expected to undergo a ""deep cleaning"" before the Bidens move in, given that it was a covid hotspot with more than a dozen people in Trump's inner circle getting infected. While majority of White House staff consists of political appointees whose jobs are co-terminus with the Presidency, the executive mansion and residence has about 100 permanent staffers, including ushers, butlers, valets etc who transition into the next dispensation. Reports from Florida also say First Lady Melania Trump has been scouting elite private schools for her son Barron Trump, who is now in 9th grade -- a sign that she too is reconciled to leaving. She has reportedly toured Pine Crest school in Fort Lauderdale, which is about 40 minutes away from Mar-a-Lago, and costs $ 35,000 per year. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump granted pardons Tuesday to two people linked to a probe into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia along with a list of others as time ticks away on his remaining weeks in office. The moves are sure to draw even further controversy and come as the outgoing Republican continues to refuse to concede defeat to Democrat Joe Biden in the November election. They add to pardons already issued to political allies of Trump, due to leave office on January 20. The White House said in a statement that Trump had granted full pardons to 15 people and commuted all or part of the sentences for five others. A full pardon was given to George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser who admitted lying to federal investigators about his contacts with Russians. Papadopoulos was a member of Trump's foreign policy advisory panel when he ran for president in 2016. He pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI about contacts with a professor who promised to connect him to senior Russian officials. He cooperated with investigators led by Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who conducted a two-year probe into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Papadopoulos spent 12 days in jail after his guilty plea. ""Today's pardon helps correct the wrong that Mueller's team inflicted on so many people,"" the White House statement said. Another full pardon was granted to Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who was also convicted in connection with Mueller's probe. Full pardons were also granted to four Blackwater security guards convicted over the 2007 killing of Iraqis. The four guards for the Blackwater security firm convicted over the 2007 shootings included Nicholas Slatten, who had been sentenced to life. They were convicted of opening fire in Baghdad's crowded Nisur Square on September 16, 2007 in a bloody episode that caused an international scandal and heightened resentment of the American presence. The shooting left at least 14 Iraqi civilians dead and 17 wounded while perpetuating the image of US security contractors run amok. The Blackwater guards said they acted in self-defense in response to insurgent fire. The White House statement said the four men, former members of the military, ""have a long history of service to the nation."" Others included on the list were three former Republican members of Congress. "
"NEW YORK: Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both top White House aides, are threatening to sue a group of anti-Trump Republicans for posting billboard ads in New York Cityâs Times Square linking them to the countryâs almost 225,000 coronavirus deaths. A lawyer representing the two made the threat on Friday in a letter to the Lincoln Project, calling the ads âfalse, malicious and defamatoryâ. "
"BEIJING: China said on Monday it firmly opposed US President Trump signing a bill that would kick Chinese companies off US stock exchanges unless they adhere to US auditing standards, saying it contains discriminatory provisions against Chinese companies. ""This is nothing but an unjustified political crackdown on Chinese enterprises listed in the United States,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily new briefing in Beijing. ""It will seriously hinder the normal listing of Chinese companies and distort the basic market economy rules that the US has always touted,"" Wang said. President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation that would remove Chinese companies from US stock exchanges unless they adhere to American auditing standards, the White House said, giving the Republican one more tool to threaten Beijing with before leaving office next month. "
"NASHVILLE: US President Donald Trump on Thursday described the air in China, Russia and India as ""filthy"" as he denounced Democratic rival Joe Biden's plans to tackle climate change. At their second and final presidential debate, Trump renewed his criticism that action on climate change was unfair to the United States. Quick Edit: Trump skipped mentioning US' role in India's 'filthy air'""Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia, look at India -- it's filthy. The air is filthy,"" Trump said at the debate in Nashville. That was the only mention of India during a debate that mostly stayed clear of foreign policy and strategic interests. Trump, Biden debate marked by clashes, but less chaosTrump's remarks come days before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper visit New Delhi for talks on building the growing US-India partnership. Trump charged that Biden's climate plan was an ""economic disaster"" for oil states such as Texas and Oklahoma. Biden said that climate change is ""an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it."" ""We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years,"" he said. The planet has already warmed by around one degree Celsius (34 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, enough to boost the intensity of deadly heat waves, droughts and tropical storms. Final US presidential debate takeaways: Trump gets personal, Biden hits on coronavirusIn 2017, Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, saying the international deal to keep global temperatures rises below 2 degree Celsius was disadvantageous to US workers. He has continuously argued that countries like China and India are benefiting the most from the Paris agreement. Speaking to his cheering supporters at an elections rally in the key battleground State of North Carolina last week, Trump had blamed countries like China, Russia and India for adding to the global air pollution. ""We have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, and so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India all these countries they're spewing stuff into the air,â he alleged during the rally. China is the world's biggest carbon emitter followed by the US, India and the EU. "
"WASHINGTON: The most improbable of presidents, Donald Trump reshaped the office and shattered its centuries-old norms and traditions while dominating the national discourse like no one before. Trump, governing by whim and tweet, deepened the nation's racial and cultural divides and undermined faith in its institutions. His legacy: a tumultuous four years that were marked by his impeachment, failures during the worst pandemic in a century and his refusal to accept defeat. He smashed conceptions about how presidents behave and communicate, offering unvarnished thoughts and policy declarations alike, pulling back the curtain for the American people while enthralling supporters and unnerving foes and sometimes allies both at home and abroad. While the nation would be hardpressed to elect another figure as disruptive as Trump, it remains to be seen how much of his imprint on the office itself, occupied by only 44 other men, will be indelible. Already it shadows the work of his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, who framed his candidacy as a repudiation of Trump, offering himself as an antidote to the chaos and dissent of the past four years while vowing to restore dignity to the Oval Office. ``For all four years, this is someone who at every opportunity tried to stretch presidential power beyond the limits of the law,'' said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. ``He altered the presidency in many ways, but many of them can be changed back almost overnight by a president who wants to make the point that there is a change.'' Trump's most enduring legacy may be his use of the trappings of the presidency to erode Americans' views of the institutions of their own government. From his first moments in office, Trump waged an assault on the federal bureaucracy, casting a suspicious eye on career officials he deemed the ``Deep State'' and shaking Americans' confidence in civil servants and the levers of government. Believing that the investigation into Russian election interference was a crusade to undermine him, Trump went after the intelligence agencies and Justice Department - calling out leaders by name - and later unleashed broadsides against the man running the probe, respected special counsel Robert Mueller. His other targets were legion: the Supreme Court for insufficient loyalty; the post office for its handling of mail-in ballots; even the integrity of the vote itself with his baseless claims of election fraud. ""In the past, presidents who lost were always willing to turn the office over to the next person. They were willing to accept the vote of the American public,"" said Richard Waterman, who studies the presidency at the University of Kentucky. ""What we're seeing right now is really an assault on the institutions of democracy.'' Current polling suggests that many Americans, and a majority of Republicans, feel that Biden was illegitimately elected, damaging his credibility as he takes office during a crisis and also creating a template of deep suspicion for future elections. ``That's a cancer,'' Waterman said. ``I don't know if the cancer can be removed from the presidency without doing damage to the office itself. I think he's done tremendous damage in the last several weeks.'' Jeopardizing the peaceful transfer of power was hardly Trump's first assault on the traditions of the presidency. He didn't release his tax returns or divest himself from his businesses. He doled out government resources on a partisan basis and undermined his own scientists. He rage tweeted at members of his own party and used government property for political purposes, including the White House as the backdrop for his renomination acceptance speech. Trump used National Guard troops to clear a largely peaceful protest across from the White House for a photo-op. He named a secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who needed a congressional waiver to serve because the retired general had not been out of uniform for the seven years required by law. In that one example, Biden has followed Trump's lead, nominating for Pentagon chief retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, who also will need a waiver. Trump's disruption extended to the global stage as well, where he cast doubt on once-inviolable alliances like NATO and bilateral partnerships with a host of allies. His ``America First'' foreign policy emanated more from preconceived notions of past slights than current facts on the ground. He unilaterally pulled troops from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and Syria, each time drawing bipartisan fire for undermining the very purpose of the American deployment. He pulled out of multinational environmental agreements, an action that scientists warn may have accelerated climate change. He stepped away from accords that kept Iran's nuclear ambitions, if not its regional malevolence, in check. And his presidency may be remembered for altering, perhaps permanently, the nature of the U.S.-China relationship, dimming hopes for a peaceful emergence of China as a world power and laying the foundation for a new generation of economic and strategic rivalry. While historians agree that Trump was a singular figure in the office, it will be decades before the consequences of his tenure are fully known. But some pieces of his legacy already are in place. He named three Supreme Court justices and more than 220 federal judges, giving the judiciary an enduring conservative bent. He rolled back regulations and oversaw an economy that boomed until the pandemic hit. His presence increased voter turnout - both for and against him - to record levels. He received unwavering loyalty from his own party but was quick to cast aside any who displeased him. ``President Trump has been the person who has returned power to the American people, not the Washington elite, and preserved our history and institutions, while others have tried to tear them down,'' said White House spokesman Judd Deere. ``The American people elected a successful businessman who promised to go to Washington, not to tear it down, but to put them first.'' At times, Trump acted like a bystander to his own presidency, opting to tweet along with a cable news segment rather than dive into an effort to change policy. And that was one of the many ways Trump changed the way that presidents communicate. Carefully crafted policy statements took a back seat, replaced by tweets and off-the-cuff remarks to reporters over the whir of helicopter blades. The discourse hardened, with swear words, personal insults and violent imagery infiltrating the presidential lexicon. And there were the untruths - more than 23,000, according to a count by The Washington Post - that Trump tossed out with little regard for their impact. It was that lack of honesty that played a role in his defeat in an election that became a referendum on how he had managed the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 300,000 Americans. Day after day during his reelection campaign, Trump defied health guidelines and addressed packed, largely mask-less crowds, promising the nation was ``rounding the corner'' on the virus. He admitted that from the beginning, he set out to play down the seriousness of the virus. He held superspreader events at the White House and contracted the virus himself. And while his administration spearheaded Operation Warp Speed, which helped to produce coronavirus vaccines in record time, Trump also undermined his pubic health officials by refusing to embrace mask-wearing and suggesting unproven treatments, including the injection of disinfectant. ``We have seen that Donald Trump's style was one of the contributing factors to his failure as a president,'' said Mark K. Updegrove, presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. ``His successor can look at his presidency as a cautionary tale.'' "
"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met for the second and last time on a debate stage Thursday after a previously scheduled town hall debate was scrapped after the Republican incumbent became one of the millions of Americans to contract coronavirus. For Trump, the matchup at Tennessee's Belmont University was perhaps the final opportunity to change the dynamics of a race dominated, much to his chagrin, by his response to the pandemic and its economic fallout. For Biden, it was 90 minutes to solidify an apparent lead less than two weeks before the election. Here are key takeaways: Covid-19 still a drag for TrumpTrump's difficulty articulating a defense of his handling of the coronavirus remains a drag on his campaign. The opening topic of the debate was entirely predictable - Trump has received variations of the same question in interviews and has rarely delivered a clear answer. Asked to outline his plan for the future, Trump instead asserted his prior handling was without fault and predicted a rosy reversal to the pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 Americans. ""We're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner,"" Trump claimed, even as cases spike again across the country. ""It's going away."" Biden, who has sought to prosecute Trump's handling of the virus in his closing pitch to voters, came prepared. ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America,"" he said. Biden added: ""He says we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it."" ""We're about to go into a dark winter,"" Biden said. ""And he has no plan."" Trump attacks Obamacare, againTrump and Biden each sought to position himself as the defender of American's health care, keenly aware that it ranked among the top issues for voters even before the coronavirus pandemic struck the nation. But Trump's efforts to repeal and undermine the Obama-era Affordable Care Act proved to be a liability, as Biden hammered his efforts to strip coverage from tens of millions of Americans and his lack of a plan to cover those with preexisting conditions. Biden, by contrast, fended off Trump's attack that his plan to reinforce the Obama-era law with a ""public option"" amounted to a step toward socialized medicine by relying on his well-established public persona _ and his vanquishing of Democratic primary rivals with more liberal health care policies. ""He thinks he's running against somebody else,"" Biden said. ""I beat all those other people."" Trump tones it downThree weeks after drawing bipartisan criticism for his frequent interruptions and badgering of his Democratic rival, Trump adopted a more subdued tone for much of the debate. Trump took to asking moderator Kristen Welker for the opportunity to follow up on Biden's answers _ ""If I may?"" _ rather than just jumping in, and he thanked Welker repeatedly to boot. From the first question, this debate seemed different from round one, when Trump's incessant interruptions and flouting of time limits derailed the 90-minute contest from the outset. Sure, there still were digs. ""We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does,"" Trump said, reprising his spring and summer attacks on Biden staying at his residence rather than campaigning in-person amid the pandemic. Biden smirked, laughed and shook his head. He mocked Trump for once suggesting bleach helped kill coronavirus. The two men had a lengthy back-and-forth about their personal finances and family business entanglements. But on the whole, voters at home got something they didn't get on September 29: a debate. It marked a recognition by Trump that his bombastic side was a liability with the seniors and suburban women voters who have flocked from the GOP to Democrats. Trump's indirect personal attacksAiming to alter the trajectory of the race, Trump returned to a tactic that he believes boosted him to the Oval Office four years ago _ staccato personal attacks on his opponent. Trump repeatedly leveled unsupported allegations against Biden and his son Hunter in an attempt to cast his rival and his family as corrupt. ""I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do,"" Trump said. Trump offered no hard proof for his assertions, and he has a record of making claims that don't withstand scrutiny. A larger question may be whether voters are moved at all, especially those undecided voters whom both candidates are trying to win over, especially given that more than 47 million Americans have already cast ballots. White men and raceWith centuries of institutional racism coming to a head in 2020, it's been a bit of disconnect to see a 74-year-old white Republican and a 77-year-old white Democrat battle for the presidency. Trump and Biden did little to dispel that disconnect. Welker offered both multiple opportunities to talk directly to Black Americans. Both men said they understood the challenges Black citizens face, but the segment amounted mostly to them blasting each other. Trump blamed Biden as an almost singular force behind mass incarceration, especially of ""young Black men."" Trump declared himself ""the least racist person in this room"" and repeated his claim that ""nobody has done what I've done"" for Black Americans ""with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception."" Biden, incredulous, called Trump a ""racist"" who ""pours fuel on every single racist fire."" Polls suggest many young voters of color do not support Trump but aren't particularly enthusiastic about Biden either. It's unlikely their final debate altered that view. ClimateTrump and Biden faced off on global climate change in the first extensive discussion of the issue in a presidential debate in 20 years. Biden sounded the alarm for the world to address a warming climate, as Trump took credit for pulling the US out of a major international accord to do just that. Trump asserted he was trying to save American jobs, while taking credit for some of the cleanest air and water the nation has seen in generations - some of it a holdover of regulations passed by his predecessor. Biden, tapping into an issue of particular importance to his base, called for massive investment to create new environmentally friendly industries. ""Our health and our jobs are at stake,"" he said. Biden also spoke of a transition from the oil industry, which Trump seized upon, asking voters in Texas and Pennsylvania if they were listening. Foreign policyBiden finally got a chance to talk a little foreign policy. But only a little. The former vice president loved the topic in the early months of the Democratic presidential primary, but the general election has been dominated by the pandemic and other national crises. He used it to hammer Trump's cozy relationship with North Korea's authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un. ""His buddy, who's a thug,"" Biden said, arguing that Trump's summit with Kim ""legitimized"" a US adversary and potential nuclear threat. Trump defended his ""different kind of relationship ... a very good relationship"" with Kim, prompting Biden to retort that nations ""had a good relationship with Hitler before he, in fact, invaded the rest of Europe."" It certainly wasn't a deep dive into a pool of complex issues. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Saturday accused members of the ""deep state"" at the Food and Drug Administration, without providing evidence, of working to slow testing of COVID-19 vaccines until after the November presidential election. In a Twitter post, Trump said the deep state ""or whoever"" at the FDA was making it very difficult for drug companies to enroll people in clinical trials to test vaccines and therapies for the novel coronavirus. The comment came after Reuters exclusively reported on Thursday that a top FDA official said he would resign if the Trump administration approved a vaccine before it was shown to be safe and effective. ""Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!"" Trump wrote, tagging FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in the tweet. The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order tâ¦ https://t.co/3RLBgVjFjG— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1598096979000Trump often uses Twitter to criticize federal agencies, sometimes accusing them of being controlled by the ""deep state"" in an apparent reference to long-serving staff who, in Trump's eyes, are determined to undermine his agenda. His tweet increases the pressure on the FDA after Peter Marks, director of its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, last week said on a conference call with government officials, pharmaceutical executives and academics that he would resign if the agency rubber-stamped an unproven vaccine. Scientists, public health officials and lawmakers are worried that the Trump administration will push the FDA to approve a vaccine in advance of the vote, even if data from clinical trials do not support its widespread use. Marks, whose division regulates cutting-edge biotech treatments, vaccines and gene therapies, told Reuters he has not faced any political pressure and that the FDA would be guided by science alone. Should that change, he said on Thursday, ""I would feel obligated (to resign) because in doing so, I would indicate to the American public that there's something wrong."" "
"WASHINGTON: Republican US Senator Mitt Romney said a widespread data breach across the US government was ""extraordinarily damaging"" and that President Donald Trump has a ""blind spot"" when it comes to Russia, which US officials believe was behind the hack. ""We've come to recognize that the president has a blind spot when it comes to Russia,"" Romney said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" one of a series of Sunday morning TV interviews. US officials and researchers say they believe at least half-a-dozen US government agencies have been infiltrated and thousands exposed in what appears to be one of the biggest such hacks ever uncovered. Trump only acknowledged the hacking on Saturday, almost a week after Reuters first reported it, downplaying its importance and questioning whether the Russians were to blame. Revelations of the hack come at a vulnerable time as the US government grapples with a contentious presidential transition and the coronavirus health crisis. US Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on ABC that the hack could still be going on and that officials had yet to determine its full scope. But he stopped short of the aggressive language used by Romney, who called the hack ""an invasion"" ""This is in that gray area between espionage and an attack,"" Warner said. Still, he backed Romney's call for retaliation, saying Washington needed to make clear to adversaries ""that if you take this kind of action we and others will strike back."" The team of President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, will consider several options to punish Russia over its suspected role once he takes office, from financial sanctions to cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure, people familiar with the matter say. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that both Russia and China want his Democratic challenger Joe Biden to win the presidential elections as no other White House occupant has been tougher to them than his administration in the last four years. Trump also said that Iran does not want him as the president but asserted that they will sign a deal with the US if he is re-elected. ""They are hoping that Biden gets in,...China is hoping that Biden gets in. Russia, probably they want Biden, because look, nobody's been tougher to Russian than me, nobody. With the pipeline, with our big military, we've become the number one energy country in the world, we're more than anybody -- we're totally energy independent now,â Trump told Fox News. ""What I've done with Russia -- and remember, Obama gave them pillows, and I gave them tank busters; there's a big difference with Ukraine. So I think Russia would like it too. But here's the thing, they want to wait until after this election because there's nobody in the world that China would rather negotiate than sleepy Joe,"" he said in response to a question. ""If they got in -- if this crew got in; the same basic crew but they've gone far left, much further left than they ever were that's why this is the most important election that we've ever had. If they ever got in, China would own the USA, China would own them,â he charged against Democratic party's presidential nominee Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris. Responding to a question, Trump alleged that Biden has been taking some kind of drugs. ""Mr. President you have suggested that Joe Biden should take a drug test,â he was asked. âI do, I would take one too. Yes, I would say he should take a drug test,â Trump replied. ""You think he's taking some sort of drugs that pep him up?â he was asked again. ""I do. I do. He's taking something. He's taking something that gives him so clarity or whateverâ¦,Take a look at him -- yeah, maybe had a lot of coffee. Maybe he had 15 cups of coffee,â Trump said. âI'll tell you what, I've seen him in the debate with the other people, including Kamala and nobody treated him worse than Kamala. He picked Kamala and nobody treated him worse...,"" said the president. ""Then he says, I'm going to pick Kamala. And Kamala has her own problems, I mean she went from 15 down to nothing. She dropped out before they got to Iowa, so I think she's not a good choice. I think compared to Mike Pence who's been a great vice president. He's been a great vice president and you guys know that very well,â Trump said. "
"NEW YORK: A federal judge turned down US President Donald Trump's newest move on Friday to keep New York City prosecutors from getting his tax records, but Trump's lawyers have already asked higher courts to step in. The developments came a day after US District Judge Victor Marrero ruled â as he had before in a case that has been to the US Supreme Court and back â that Manhattan's top prosecutor could subpoena the records for a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers immediately appealed Thursday's ruling. They also asked Marrero to delay enforcement of the subpoena while the appeal plays out. Marrero said no to that Friday. âThe president has not demonstrated that he will suffer irreparable harmâ if the records are turned over for a grand jury probe that would keep them secret, he wrote. However, Trump's lawyers noted in a court filing Thursday that they were making the same request of an appeals court and the Supreme Court. âThe president raises serious arguments,â Trump attorney William Consovoy wrote in an appeals court filing Friday, adding that it's âimplausibleâ that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr ""needs these records so badly that there's no time for appellate review"". Vance's office, which has agreed to hold off enforcing the subpoena for a week, declined to comment Friday. Messages seeking comment were sent Friday to Trump's lawyers. Marrero has refused multiple times to block the subpoena. The US Supreme Court last month upheld one of his rulings, finding that the presidency in itself doesn't shield Trump from Vance's investigation. But the high court returned the case to Marrero's courtroom to allow Trump's lawyers to raise other concerns about the subpoena. They did, arguing that it was issued in bad faith, might have been politically motivated and amounted to harassment. Vance's attorneys countered that they were entitled to extensive records to aid a âcomplex financial investigation,â citing public reports of âextensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organisation.â Those arguments led to this week's flurry of rulings and appeals. Trump blasted the long-running quest for his financial records Thursday as a âcontinuation of the most disgusting witch hunt in the history of our country.â Vance, a Democrat, began seeking the Republican president's tax returns from his longtime accounting firm over a year ago, after Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that the president had misled tax officials, insurers and business associates about the value of his assets. The president has said he expects the case to end up back before the Supreme Court. Even if the tax records ultimately are subpoenaed, they would not automatically be made public, as they are being sought as part of a confidential grand jury investigation. Congress is also pursuing Trump's financial records, though the Supreme Court last month kept a hold on the banking and other documents that Congress has been seeking and returned the case to a lower court. Trump is the only modern president who has refused to release his tax returns. Before he was elected, he had promised to do so. "
"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is set to preside over the signing of historic diplomatic deals between Israel and two Gulf Arab nations that could herald a dramatic shift in Middle East power dynamics and give him a boost ahead of the November election. In a White House ceremony aimed at showcasing presidential statesmanship, Trump will host more than 700 guests Tuesday on the South Lawn to witness the sealing of the agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Trump and his allies hope the occasion will burnish Trump's credentials as a peacemaker at the height of his reelection campaign. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Emirati and Bahraini foreign ministers are to ink the deals before the crowd, which will include representatives of supporting nations from the Washington-based diplomatic corps but few other dignitaries from overseas. Some congressional Democrats who have offered muted praise have been invited to attend. In addition to the individual bilateral agreements signed by Israel, the UAE and Bahrain, all three will sign a trilateral document, officials said. The agreements are dubbed the ""Abraham Accords"" after the patriarch of the world's three major monotheistic religions. Trump is expected to sign as a witness. The agreements won't end active wars but will rather formalize the normalization of the Jewish state's already warming relations with the two countries. And, while not addressing the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they may pave the way for a broader Arab-Israeli rapprochement after decades of enmity, a pair of wars and only two previous peace deals. Sceptics, including many longtime Mideast observers, analysts, experts and former officials, have expressed doubts about the impact of the deals and lamented that they ignore the Palestinians, who have rejected them as a stab in the back by fellow Arabs. Yet even the harshest critics have allowed that they could usher in a seismic shift in the region should other Arab nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, follow suit, with implications for Iran, Syria and Lebanon. Other Arab countries believed to be close to recognizing Israel include Oman, Sudan and Morocco. ""These agreements are a huge accomplishment for the countries involved and have led to a tremendous sense of hope and optimism in the region,"" said Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who led the negotiations. ""Instead of focusing on past conflicts, people are now focused on creating a vibrant future filled with endless possibilities."" Tuesday's ceremony follows months of intricate diplomacy headed by Kushner and Trump's envoy for international negotiations, Avi Berkowitz, that first bore fruit Aug. 13 when the Israel-UAE deal was announced. That was followed by the first direct commercial flight between the countries, and then the Sept. 11 announcement of the Bahrain-Israel agreement. The specific contents of the individual documents to be signed Tuesday, however, were not known ahead of the ceremony. While officials said they would hew closely to the joint statements issued when the deals were first announced, it remained unclear if the agreements would require further action by the three governments or what binding obligations they would commit each to enforcing. A senior White House official said Monday that the documents had been completed and that the UAE-Israel agreement would be longer and more detailed than the Bahrain agreement because there had been more time to finalize it. Still, the lack of clarity even a day before the ceremony has raised some suspicions about the durability of the agreements. Even in Israel, where the accords have received widespread acclaim, there is concern that that they might result in U.S. sales of sophisticated weaponry to the UAE and Bahrain, thus potentially upsetting Israel's qualitative military edge in the region. Meanwhile, a politically vulnerable Netanyahu is facing questions about appearing at such a large event just days after he announced a new nationwide lockdown to fight a surge in coronavirus cases that will impose severe restrictions on movement and gatherings. The White House is encouraging those attending Tuesday's ceremony to wear masks. And while the UAE and Bahrain have a history of suppressing dissent and critical public opinion, there have been indications that the agreements are not nearly as popular or well-received as in Israel. For one, neither country is sending its head of state or government to sign the deals with Netanyahu. Bahrain's largest Shiite-dominated opposition group, Al-Wefaq, which the government ordered dissolved in 2016 amid a yearslong crackdown on dissent, said there is widespread rejection in the country of normalization. Al-Wefaq said in a statement that it joins other Bahrainis who categorically reject the agreement to normalize ties with the 'Zionist entity,' and criticized the government for crushing the public's ability to express opinions ""to obscure the extent of discontent"" at normalization. In the UAE, there has been speculation that Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, widely seen as the country's day-to-day leader and architect of the Emirati push to improve relations with Israel, is steering clear of the signing ceremony. Although Emirati protocol dictates that the foreign minister and not the crown prince of a specific emirate be dispatched to represent the country in lieu of the UAE's president, who's rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke more than six years ago, there's speculation the crown prince is not attending the White House ceremony for political reasons. He may not want to be seen throwing too much of his support behind Trump weeks ahead of a US presidential election in which the outcome is far from certain. While the pageantry of the White House signing ceremony offers Trump and Netanyahu a political triumph, Prince Mohammed faces neither reelection pressures nor protests at home. The Emiratis may also be wary of appearing too close to Netanyahu, who publicly stated in August his opposition to the sale of US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets to the UAE. While the UAE has said that Israel not moving ahead with plans to annex West Bank settlements is a cornerstone of the agreement, Netanyahu has insisted that annexation is only suspended and remains on the table.

"NEW YORK: Safety, the economy and friendship for India are the themes of video ads supporting US President Donald Trump produced by an entrepreneur in the duel of the two political parties Indian-American votes in key states in the November 3 election. ""When I heard Trump had Covid-19, I said, 'What the hell, I must gear up and do something for this guy rather than stay home and fume about the news',"" Danny Gaekwad, who has produced a series of video ads backing the President, told IANS about his foray into the campaign. Describing himself as a grassroots political activist who has stayed away from national politics and has supported both Democrats and Republicans, Gaekwad said that he made an exemption for Trump because he is a ""real guy"" who ""supports India 100 per cent"". He said that till he met Trump he had been turned off from national politics because at that level most leaders were ""fakes"" and working at the grassroots for local, state and federal legislators was more effective. Gaekwad, who traces his lineage to the family that had ruled the Baroda princely state, is a serial entrepreneur, developer and investor, is a member of the advisory committee of the 'Indian Voices for Donald Trump' campaign. Two of his ads on the theme, ""Trump hai toh safe hai"" (With Trump we're safe), feature clips of him speaking in Ahmedabad earlier this year about the ""special place"" India has in his heart and extolling Indian-Americans. About the stress on safety, Gaekwad said that Indian-owned businesses were looted and burned during the Black Lives Matter protests backed by the Democratic Party against police brutality and racism. He asked: ""Is this the Democratic agenda? Indian lives don't matter?"" His videos are straightforward, with direct messages, unlike the video for the Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden with Bollywood music. Another video released on Monday by Gaekwad makes an appeal to the purse, especially of businesspeople, extolling Trump's economic record as president and as a job-creating entrepreneur while attacking Biden's policies and his personal career of 47 years on the public payroll. In the ad, he also defends Trump's record in the pandemic crisis asserting that he acted fast and also helped saved businesses like his hotels through the programme to help with payroll when the occupancy plunged. He takes another jab at Biden, calling him a ""China lover"". Besides circulating on social media, Gaekwad claimed that his ads are running on several TV programmes. Another Trump video ad was circulated earlier this year by the Trump campaign on social media with clips from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Texas last year and Trump's Ahmedabad ""Namaste Trump"" meeting this year, with both leaders proclaiming their and their nations' close friendship. Credit for the ad's concept was given to Al Mason, the co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee. Kimberly Guilfoyle, the chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, tweeted soon after its release: ""America enjoys a great relationship with India and our campaign enjoys great support from Indian-Americans."" Although Indian-American voters are estimated to number only about 1.3 million, they could make a difference in the swing states where neither party has a lock on the voters and could go either way with small margins. The electoral college made up electors representing states gave Trump the victory in 2016 although he got 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton. She lost one of the swing states, Wisconsin, by just about 10,000 votes. Explaining why he shows up in two of the videos with a gun, Gaekwad said that he is a strong defender of the Constitution's Second Amendment giving citizens the right to bear arms, having grown up in India with guns and with a son in the US Army. Gun rights, which the Democratic Party wants curbed, are an important issue for Trump supporters. Gaekwad traces his lineage to the Gaekwad family, which was once the ruler of the Baroda princely state. Asserting that he supported many Democratic politicians like House of Representatives member Raja Krishnamoorthi, Maryland state legislator Kumar Barve and former Iowa state legislator Swati Dandekar, and others he said that he backs all Indian-American candidates in elections at all levels a"" as long as they were not anti-India. Indian-Americans as a tiny minority have to support candidates from the community realising that ""if we are not at the table, we will be on the menu"", Gaekwad said. Asked why then he was not supporting Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's vice-presidential candidate who is of Indian descent, he said: ""Her comments are anti-India."" ""I am not gonna help Kamala Harris who is running against my candidate Donald Trump"" who ""stands by his friend India"", he said. Gaekwad claimed that he has not seen Harris proudly say on national TV that she is Indian-American and her recent overtures to the community are only because she thinks it is like a bank cash dispensing machine. ""We have to ask what we get in return"" for supporting a candidate, he said. "

"PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plans to make use of Covid-19 jumbo hospitals for vaccination during the second or subsequent phases. The move is on the lines of Mumbai, where the municipal corporation has decided to use the jumbo hospital for vaccination. âThe facilities are well equipped. The health department will take the final call on it,â said Rajendra Muthe, head of the PMCâs building and establishment department. âThe facilities available in the hospitals will be useful for carrying out vaccination on a large scale,â said a senior official of the PMCâs health department. Ashish Bharati, head of the PMCâs health department, was not available for comment despite repeated attempts. "
"Ahmedabad: The Covid-19 pandemic brought the routine medical procedures to a grinding halt in March last year. But several cancer patients could not wait for the lockdown to be lifted, or could not sustain only on medicines. While the patients were afraid to enter the medical setting fearing Covid-19 infection, it was equally distressing times for the surgeons who were exposed to the aerosols generated by the patients during the procedures.Dr Kaustubh Patel, senior city-based surgical oncologist (head & neck), said that the initial phase of the pandemic was the most difficult. âAfter September, the patients started trickling in, and after December, we saw the regular numbers resuming. But in the initial phase, the viral infection was new for us all and we decided to perform life-saving surgeries despite understanding the risk involved,â he said.For the surgical procedures, the team devised a âshieldâ in-house. âThe moulded hard plastic apparatus had an opening on one side and two holes on the other. After the apparatus is kept on the patientâs head, the surgeon can see the process through transparent plastic sheet. We performed several procedures with the shield,â said Dr Patel.Another indigenous development for the oncologists was âaerosol collector.â Dr Dushyant Mandlik, surgical oncologist, said that the instrument was designed in a way that it could arrest all the aerosols generated from the patientâs mouth during a surgery. âThe surgeries take a long time, and generation of aerosols was natural. Thus, the instrument would be used along with the probe to ensure that there are no aerosols â which could contain the virus â in the operation theatre,â he said.The city-based experts also devised ways to perform surgeries where exposure could be reduced."
"PUNE: Union minister Ramdas Athawale, whose 'go corona, go' chant became a national sensation, on Sunday came out with a new slogan, 'No Corona', saying it was in response to the new strain of the novel coronavirus. ""I gave the 'Go Corona Go' slogan and the virus is now going. But it also came near me, leading to my hospitalisation (after testing Covid-19 positive). I thought coronavirus would not reach me but it can reach anywhere,"" Athawale said. ""For the new coronavirus strain, I would say 'No Corona, No Corona' as we don't want either the old coronavirus or the new strain to infect us,"" he told reporters in Pune. Athawale was discharged from a private hospital in Mumbai last month, 10 days after testing coronavirus positive. In February, a video of Athawale, along with a Chinese diplomat and Buddhist monks chanting ""Go corona, go corona"" at a prayer meeting went viral on social media. The video was reportedly shot at the Gateway of India here on February 20 during a prayer session to stop the spread of coronavirus in China. Athawale (60) is a member of the Rajya Sabha and minister of state for social justice in the Narendra Modi-led government. ""I will be meeting BJP president J P Nadda to discuss a possible alliance for West Bengal Assembly elections,"" he said. ""We expect (BJP to set aside for us) around 10 seats,"" he added. "
"Madurai: Amidst cheers of an electric crowd, a determined horde of bull tamers and charging bulls made sure the spirit of jallikattu kept burning as ever among Tamil youths in Palamedu on Friday. The world-renowned Palamedu Jallikattu saw a neck-and-neck contest for the best bull tamer with Karthik from Karuppayurani, Madurai taking home a car after taming 18 bulls to claim the first place, closely followed by Prabhakaran from Podumbu village in Madurai, who tamed 17 bulls. A slow start with minor disruptions and drama was more than made up for by the gifts that rained from the Vadivasal on the victorious bull tamers and owners â silver vessels, gift hampers, clothes, bicycles, beds, grinders and what not. Emotions ran high as bull tamers and owners got into passionate fights which needed intervention. Tamers had their fair share of struggle against the bulls that were keen to toss them around. The bull belonging to AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran too did just that to emerge victorious. This time, as a unique addition to the range of gifts, cookers, which is the symbol of AMMK, were also in the mix. In each round of the event, 30 bull tamers were allowed and towards the end, seven were selected for the final rounds. At the end of eight rounds, a total of 674 bulls out of the 783 registered ones had been released and 600 bull tamers had taken part. The jallikattu came to a close by 5 pm with an extra hour of action being permitted considering the number of bulls left for release. The event left around 30 bull tamers injured. The best bull tamer, Karthick from Karuppayurani, who tamed 18 bulls credited his family and mentors for the win. âThis is a team effort. I won third place here last time and now have come first. With the support of fellow bull tamers, jallikattu was fun and I did not even feel any pain,â he said. Karthick, who is doing his diploma in civil engineering, also urged the government to give a government job to the winners. The third place went to another Karthick, who was from Mettupatti, after he tamed 10 bulls. The bull of Jeyaraman from Palamedu emerged as the best bull, followed by bulls of Kalimuthu from Vathirairuppu and Veerapandi from Sikkandarchavadi in second and third place. The owner of the best bull was awarded a Kangeyam cow and a calf. The action, not much unlike the coronavirus, was contagious as spectators and villagers were as much a part of the event. The event was flagged off by revenue minister R B Udhayakumar. Covid-19 safety was a major concern as hundreds of villagers crowded in front of Vadivasal without masks and not following social distancing, not to speak of the thousands who thronged the arena. "
"Ahmedabad: The tree was about 5 feet tall, most of its leaves were missing â it looked like a shelf with the majority of its books unreturned. Yet, Pandit Birju Maharaj saw in the tree a forest of implications. âThat tree over thereâ¦,â Panditji pointed out during a 2018 interview with TOI, â...doesnât it look like a dancer with the hip bent and the arm thrust forward to make a dramatic point!â Panditjiâs art, Kathak, derives from âkathaâ or âstoryâ. He and his disciples were featured in the concluding session of the e-Saptak finale, on Wednesday. The Saptak stage can be crossed with a few strides, but in that space Panditji has related kathas that cover the infinite cultural acreage of mythology, human condition, and the power of nature. In the sumptuous horror of the battlefield in âWar and Peaceâ, Leo Tolstoy makes Nikolai Rostov say: âIn myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry...â. In the sunshine, Rostov can finally see his own perplexity about his passion to become a war hero. The monumental setting is the stage for an individualâs awakening. Panditji can turn on that sunlight in any setting â in a garden with a 5-foot tree, at the Saptak venue, or on a digital streaming platform. Indeed, it is owing to classical notables such as Panditji that Saptak-2021 was a success. The organizers took the festival online this year because Covid had made it impossible for rasikas to attend the annual event in person. But as Panditjiâs tree has shown, it is the mind that gives remote access to meaning; so the site of contemplation shouldnât matter. Of course, rasikas hope to be amid the luxuriant foliage of âwahsâ next year because human company has become as valuable as artistic pleasure. "

The condition of the Covid testing centre at Rohini Sector 17 is such that even a healthy person will get ill. 
"Ahmedabad: On Tuesday morning, the citizens queued up outside an urban health centre (UHC) in Sector 2 of state capital Gandhinagar â they had received SMS about date and time of their vaccination for Covid-19. They showed their identity proof outside the centre, underwent medical check-up including symptom check for viral infection and lastly also got the âinjectionâ â the entire process for Covid-19 vaccination only had one thing missing, which was Covid-19 vaccine!A total of 475 mock beneficiaries â 25 each at the 19 identified vaccination booths in Gandhinagar and Rajkot districts â underwent the exercise on Tuesday. Gujarat was part of the nationwide dry run in four states to understand possible trouble points, technical glitches and improve the delivery system.Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, told TOI that the dry run was successful. âRight from supply chain preparedness and communication between various centres to technological part of the drive, everything went smoothly. The intended volunteers got the SMS, their verification could be done through a designated software and the mock vaccination process also took place with SOPs in place,â he said, adding that the officials from WHO and UNICEF were present as observers.At each booth, it was a three-tier system with identification, health check-up and vaccination stages. The designated rooms for waiting and observing after the vaccination were also created with support staff, said officials.In all, the state has so far trained 16,000 health workers for the job of vaccination. The health department officials on Monday claimed that the state is prepared to vaccinate 16 lakh persons in a day at its optimal capacity.âWe received a list of beneficiaries from Co-Win software. Trained vaccinators have been deputed in three rooms created for different purposes at these booths (identified for the mock drill),â said Dr M H Solanki, CDHO, Gandhinagar. Those who were vaccinated were given slip of the timing of the vaccine and contact details for emergency help. They were also given the approximate date for the second shot â working as a booster dose. Officials said that if a person is not able to attend the vaccination, he/she will be given a new time through SMS."
"HYDERABAD: Even as the number of active cases in the state came down to 723 on Monday from nearly 5,000 a month back, Telangana recorded 118 new cases and two deaths.

"HYDERABAD: Though the renewal and sale of standard Corona policies is expected to decline in the coming days due to falling Covid-19 cases, it is not likely to have a negative bearing on the overall growth of health insurance sector, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) chairman Subhash C Khuntia said on Friday. Addressing participants virtually at the 17th Annual Insurance Brokersâ Summit, organised by Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI), Khuntia pointed out that the standard Covid-19 policies were introduced to protect the uninsured as a âstop gapâ arrangement during the pandemic and has been serving its purpose. He said the pandemic has made people realise the importance of having adequate health coverage and is expected to boost overall health insurance in the near-term. He pointed out that 1.28 crore standard Covid policies with a total premium of over Rs 1,000 crore have been sold so far. âUnder Corona Kavach, which is the standard product, 42 lakh lives have been protected, while 5.36 lakh lives have been protected through Corona Rakshak,â Khuntia said. The IRDAI chairman also urged brokers to enhance their contribution towards life insurance as well as individual health insurance in the country. He also urged the broker community to leverage digital tools to reach out to the stakeholders and customers. âI see a huge opportunity in the tier 2 and 3 cities and towns. Substantial economic growth is expected from rural areas and I would urge the broker community to penetrate this untapped segment. Further focus is required on the MSME sector and new insurance products have been added to cater to this,â he said. He said brokers must represent the interest of customers and assist policyholders during the life cycle of the policies. âThough you have got the policy holder insured, you must also guide them on how to prevent risk against which they are insured,â he added. Besides, he also urged the brokers community to reach out to MSMEs to offer or part-finance standard pension covers or group health policies or life policies for their employees. Meanwhile, Sumit Bohra, president, IBAI, pointed out that post the pandemic, the role of brokers has enhanced as the nature of risk has changed. "
"BHOPAL: In the Trilanga branch of a nationalised bank, a group of employees, who had perhaps won the union election, surged in on Thursday morning, exchanging greetings and garlands with branch staff. None of them were wearing masks or used sanitiser and, of course, social distancing was furthest from their minds. This, when several customers were waiting â most of them elderly people. This was the same branch, where at the peak of the Coronavirus pandemic, the guard would not only sanitise customersâ hands, but deter them from entering unless essential. Staff of the branch not only wore masks, which they still do, but also gloves and counters used to be segregated with ropes. But, the manner in which a group of their colleagues from other branches were conducting themselves on Thursday â without any protest from either the staff or customers â reflected the receding âconsciousnessâ on the deadly infection as Covid cases dip. Whatâs being missed in the belief that Covid is waning is that Bhopal not only has the highest number of active cases â at 667 on Friday, over twice that of Indore â but has been topping the daily count in MP almost since the beginning of the year. Experts say it is imperative to adhere to Covid-19 protocol as nothing is worse than contracting the infection at a time when the pandemic is on the back foot. State coordinator for coronavirus, Dr Lokendra Dave, said, âIt is essential not to lower guards till most of the people get vaccinated. People should continue wearing masks and maintain social distancing as before.â But, even those who were particular about observing the Covid-19 norms in their offices or shops are finding it difficult to stick to it as their own friends are asking them to stop âfussing over Coronaâ. âI had a sanitiser machine installed in office and put a note at the gate requesting everyone to wear masks, but now when I ask my friends or clients to use the sanitiser machine or not to take off their mask, they just smile and move on. Since the vaccines arrived and corona cases started declining, people now feel all those precautions are not necessary now,â said Gyandev Mishra, a builder. âNot everyone was wearing masks earlier also, but now many of those who were particular about wearing masks at public places and not getting into crowded places have also stopped the practice. This, despite the fact that the changed caller tune after vaccination clearly says âDawai bhi, kadai bhiâ,â said Rajat Agrawal, a shopkeeper. Meanwhile, police, municipal staff and the administration also seem to have become slack in catching and punishing people not wearing masks. Collector Avinash Lavania, however, has been particular in cautioning people to continue sticking to Covid-19 protocol even while talking about falling Corona cases and the improving recovery rate. âMy appeal to people has been to wear masks in public places, observe social distancing and not crowd. Frequent washing of hands is vital,â he said. "

"Bhopal: More than 55% of the 2,800 active Covid-19 patients of the state are in home isolation, as on Friday.It is noteworthy that the state government had closed the Covid care centres (CCCs) in the entire state, except in state capital Bhopal from January 1 onwards, as the number of active patients had started declining and CCCs were vacant. Sources said that one of the major causes of the vacancy in the CCCs was due to the fact that most of the patients preferred home isolation.Additional chief secretary (health) Mohammed Suleman confirmed that 55% of the active patients are in home isolation and the remaining are in hospitals.When TOI talked to the patients who were in the home isolation, a few patients said that they received regular calls from the control rooms and updates were taken, while others said that the calls had stopped after a week.âI was found corona positive and remained in home isolation. Now, I do not have any issues. During that period, people from the control room used to call us twice a day and enquired about my health condition. Now I am okay, but I am yet to get any recovery certificate,â said a 26-year old student from Arera Colony who tested positive on January 13.Another 46-year-old patient from MP Nagar zone I area of Bhopal said, âI had gone for tests as I was not feeling well. I was diagnosed as positive in the rapid test. I remained in home isolation and officials would call me every day for the first 7 days, then the calls stopped. I am totally fit and finenow, but I had also requested for a re-test which has not been done till now.âSources said that with increase in awareness regarding Covid-19 precautions, a majority of the people have started opting for home isolation and with the relaxation in the Covid-19 lockdown norms, the number of people remaining in home isolation has increased.

"GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat state election commission (SEC) has issued Covid-19 guidelines for campaigning for the forthcoming local body elections. Candidates who have contracted the coronavirus will have to confine their outreach to online platforms. Political parties will be allowed to run door-to-door campaigns, albeit with some restrictions. According to the guidelines, only five persons will be able to accompany a candidate during the door-to-door visits. Only five vehicles can be part of campaigning. Prior permissions of the nodal officers concerned will be mandatory for all public meetings. Details of entry and exit of participants will have to be provided. All district and other authorities will have to appoint a nodal officer to ensure that these guidelines are adhered to. SEC guidelines say that candidates and political parties will have to arrange masks, sanitizers, and other corona-fighting essentials during political activities and ensure that all their workers follow social distancing norms. The SEC has requested political parties and candidates to use social and electronic media to reach out to masses rather than personally contacting them. The SEC has directed all local election officers to register cases under the Disaster Management Act and the IPC against those who violate the Covid-19 guidelines. "
"AHMEDABAD: Dhvaj Haria and Rupesh Shah, both from Ahmedabad, have become prominent names in the last few years in the cue sport, both at national and international levels. They have churned out some incredible victories. Both can easily be called among the best in the field in the state. Ahmedabad, considered to be the nursery and the hub for this sports in India, has given eminent players of the calibre of Satish Mohan, Neelkamal Vakil, Rajkamal Vakil and Geet Sethi in the past â all legends and big names on the international arena. Dhvaj, 27, ranked amongst the top 3 in India in billiards and top 5 snooker, is the most promising of the current lot. Having all the shots in his armour, the talented cueist reached back-to-back finals of the senior national billiards in 2018 and 2019. âThis year due to the pandemic, I was unable to play international tournaments in Leeds, London and Melbourne,ââ said a dejected Dhvaj, speaking to TOI. However, the talented youngster has taken the pandemic in his stride. âI have been practising regularly at home and at the Sports Club (following the new safety norms) in the evening. It has also given me an opportunity to practise and learn new skills,â said Dhvaj. âThis year, I was supposed to participate at the World Billiards Limited championship and the World Matchplay championship at Leeds in April and the IBSF World Billiards championship in October, but couldn't participate due to the pandemic,ââ said the Arjuna award winner, Rupesh, 47. Ahmedabadâs Sonic Multani, the current national snooker coach, too, feels that apart from established players like Rupesh and Dhvaj, the pandemic has affected the progress of the upcoming players too.

"The fear of the âCâ word has given rise to a new term known as âCorona Anxietyâ.â I will get COVID if I step out.â What if the BMC takes me to an isolation center ? These are the common questions that our parents have been asking us since the start. Tackling this anxiety is not easy. What we lack is acceptance. Itâs not easy but the moment you try accepting the fact that the corona virus is here to stay for long and no matter how much precaution you take, you might still be at the receiving end of it. Just keep boosting your immunity and keep washing your hands. But along with taking care of your physical health, taking care of mental health has become of utmost importance especially during the lockdown. Try to keep yourself away from whatâs app news and deviate your energies into something useful. Every moment is a fresh beginning! "

"Rekha Das, head of anaesthesia at Acharya Harihara Regional Cancer Centre, Cuttack, was infected with Covid in September. On Tuesday, she took a dose of the vaccine. She shared her experience with Minati SinghaOn AHRCC being a Covid-19 hotspot earlier last yearAHRCC is eastern Indiaâs premier government-run cancer care centre. A large number of people from the different states come here for treatment. So when the virus was spreading rapidly, a large number of patients and health workers got infected. On battling the virus as a Covid warriorI was chairman of the infection control committee at AHRCC. We tightened enforcement of safety guidelines. Since a large number of patients depend on the hospital, we could not close it down. We continued treatment of patients and even surgeries. It was team work that helped us successfully contain the spread. On contracting the virus herselfIt is difficult to pinpoint the source of infection. But it was definitely from a patient. In the operation theatre, while administering anaesthesia, I had to come in close breathing contact of patients. My symptoms were neither very serious nor very mild. I took rest for 16-18 days and became fit again. On vaccine hesitancyCovid-19 has not been eliminated. More serious strains of the virus have been detected in the UK and other countries. So it is very important to take the vaccine so that we can stay safe. I would urge everyone to get vaccinated without any doubt or fear in their mind. On severity of the infectionA: The COvid-19 infection in me was neither very serious nor very mild, it was in moderate degree. On fear factorVaccine doesnât scare me If it would have scared us we could not be able to take up so much awareness activities and continued our work. "
"AHMEDABAD: Convalescent blood plasma, often administered to Covid-19 positive patients with moderate symptoms, may be discontinued from the state hospitals after changes in national Covid-19 management guidelines, indicated experts.  Experts are also keeping an eye on the final word on ivermectin and favipiravir, two of the drugs â anti-parasitic and anti-viral medicines respectively â used by some Indian states in Covid-19 treatment. While use of ivermectin is not much prevalent in Gujarat, several private hospitals administer favipiravir to the patients. âWe are awaiting the new treatment guidelines by the Indian Council on Medical Research (ICMR) for the Covid-19 infection. We donât have any state-specific protocol but there surely can be modifications based on the local conditions and requirement,â said a senior state health department official. âDecision on the convalescent blood plasma therapy is not yet taken at the state level. But if itâs discontinued at the national level, we will follow the suit.â While a section of experts has advocated use of plasma therapy on the grounds that it can show results in selective patients, a recent ICMR report based on the trials between April and July in 39 hospitals across the country showed that it doesnât help in reducing mortality. Several hospitals in Gujarat are already providing the plasma therapy to Covid-19 patients. Dr Maharshi Desai, a city-based critical care specialist and member of the state-appointed committee on Covid-19 control, said that with lack of any specific medicines for Covid-19 treatment at the moment, the primary focus is on re-purposed medicines. âAfter seven months of pandemic, we have understood what works and what doesnât â thus, the focus is on anti-virals, immuno-suppressants, anti-coagulants and steroids. I believe use of ivermectin is not much prevalent in Gujarat,â he said. âFavipiravir is used in moderate cases of infection, whereas focus is still on remdesivir and tocilizumab,â said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA).

"HYDERABAD: The positivity rate in the state dropped to 0.6 per cent on Tuesday, a first since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2020, when the first cases of the novel coronavirus were recorded in the state, the average positivity rate was 8.92 per cent, which peaked in June. Positivity rate denotes number of people who tested positive out of total number of tests performed. In March, just 97 patients had tested positive out of 1,087 who were tested.  But by June, the positivity rate went up to 21.73 per cent when 13,534 patients tested positive. The average positivity rate since the onset of the pandemic till now in the state has been four per cent, making Telangana better placed than most other states of the country. The positivity rate began declining from August last year (6.56 per cent). While this is a good sign for the state, which has been able to control the spread of the virus, health authorities have cautioned people to be careful. âIt is essential that people take precautions till end of January and early February. We are urging people to avoid celebrating Sankranti in public spaces,â said a senior health official, adding that any lapses can send positivity rate soaring again. "
"CHENNAI: When La Liga rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona meet, it is always a grand occasion. The El Clasico, as both teams are aware, has much more than just the three points at stake. But when the Spanish giants square up for this season's first Clasico, much of the grandeur will be missing. There are two reasons for this. The fans, of course, will be absent on this occasion due to the Covid-19 pandemic and not be able to show the kind of fervour that makes the fixture stand out. But more importantly, both teams appear to be a pale shadow of the teams that have dominated Europe over the years. After a spell of sustained success, neither team has been particularly impressive of late. Both of them lost last week to lowly opponents in La Liga while Real's misery was exacerbated by a shock Champions League defeat to a depleted Shakhtar Donetsk just a couple of days ago. In the best of times, this is a game neither club wants to lose. However, with both sides teetering on the brink of a crisis, avoiding defeat becomes even more imperative. Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois admitted that a positive Clasico result would do a lot to bolster their confidence. ""It's a long season, and the three points are the same as any other week. But obviously, confidence-wise and for our own pride it's important to win. Above all, it's the pride you can take from winning El Clasico,"" Courtois told TOI on Friday in exclusive quotes shared by La Liga. Talking about Real's troubling start to the season, Courtois said that the problem has been the team's lack of goals. ""When you play for Real Madrid, the objective is to get to every final and to win. That's what makes this club the best in the world. think we could have scored more goals this season, but it's not because we don't have firepower. It has been a tough season so far but we will start winning soon."" Barcelona, of course, have had their fair share of well-documented problems. With Lionel Messi's public spat with the board still simmering under the surface and his performances wavering in a new set-up under coach Ronald Koeman, things aren't looking rosy in the Barcelona camp. Midfielder Frenkie de Jong, though, said that having Messi in their midst still gives them the upper hand. ""To have someone like Messi in your team is great because he's the best player in the world and you know that he can score a goal or assist from nowhere. He can create a big chance from nothing. I think it's a huge advantage to have him in your team. You can always pass the ball to him because he's normally not losing it that much,"" felt the Dutchman. Given that the Clasico results last season weren't in Barcelona's favour (a draw and 0-2 loss), De Jong said that they were taking a cautious approach this time. ""Real Madrid are going to be a tough opponent for us. They are really confident and they have a really strong squad. But of course, I would like to get a feel of what it is to win the El Clasico,"" he added. "
"The novel coronavirus has foisted an unusual Durga Puja on Kolkata this year. One C-word, âCovidâ, has led to another C-word, âCautionâ. The spike in cases after Mahalaya has prompted health experts to apprehend another â possibly bigger â surge after the festivities are over. Government agencies have done their bit to nudge the festival towards a new-normal mode; the Calcutta High Court has given the final push, curbing crowds in the immediate vicinity of pandals. Puja organisers have fallen in line â some eagerly, some grudgingly â but the combined effort has had its effect in, at least, the run-up to the four big days; the number of revellers on the road has reduced substantially. TOI has lined up for you some of the cityâs bigger pujas but, in a nod to the spirit of the times, it comes with a newnormal twist: a new check-list â of Covid precautions being taken by organisers â has bludgeoned its way in this year. Hopefully, we will not have any reason to repeat this next year when we can go back to the old normal: jostle with each other as we struggle to include the pratimaâs face in our selfie frame, fight for elbow room during the morning anjali, burp to glory in the evening after wheedling that extra phuchka out of the neighbourhood phuchkawallah, do the dhunuchi dance (with a few mistimed steps) to the dhakâs beat at night and then bid goodbye to the Goddess and her children with a dash of sindoor khela the morning after. Letâs pray that we are able to slay the coronasura by celebrating responsibly this year so that we can return to the old normal next year. Happy reading and a safe Durga Puja! "
"INDORE: Virology laboratory of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College has reported increase of about five per cent in Covid-19 sample testing in December from November after three months of continuous dip. The lab still failed to test the samples at its fullest capacity. The records of the virology laboratory showed testing rose to 39388 samples in December in comparison to 37419 in November. The laboratory can test around 60,000 samples a month with an average testing of about 1800 to 2000 daily. Of those 39,388 samples tested in December only 45% were from Indore, rest was from other districts of division. This is the only government-run laboratory in the division and also the biggest in the state in terms of capacity. Dr Manish Purohit, associate professor microbiology department said, âThe lab is functioning round the clock at its maximum capacity. It has been testing as many samples received.â The number might have declined because of receiving less samples for RT-PCR testing. The lab has a capacity of testing between 1800 to 2000 samples per day, said Dr Purohit. Going by what Dr Purohit said showed that the laboratory received a maximum number of samples from Indore as well as other districts in August. But, later the number of samples declined. The decline in RT-PCR testing in virology laboratories might be also because of more focus on Rapid Antigen Testing. RAT for Covid-19 is rapid and cost effective but less efficient than RT-PCR, which is considered gold standard with 80% efficacy. "
"CHHAPRA: The monthlong Harihar Kshetra Mela or Sonepur fair, which is organized in the months of November and December every year, has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Sonepur SDO Sunil Kumar, both the Sonepur fair and the Godna-Semaria Mela will not be organized this year. However, considering the religious sentiments of the devotees, police and security personnel will be deputed in Sonepur on the occasion of Kartik Purnima on November 30. âWe have urged people to avoid rush while performing âGanga snanâ on Kartik Purnima,â the SDO told this newspaper on Thursday. The administration has also decided to suspend the movement of traffic on the old bridge over the Gandak from Sunday night to Monday. Vehicular movement on the new bridge will remain unaffected. âWe will not set up any temporary police station or outpost to regulate traffic. We have, however, requested the railways to run additional trains to help the devotees reach Sonepur on Kartik Purnima,â Saran range DIG B K Verma said. MLA in favour of organising fair: Sonepur MLA Ramanuj Prasad has asked the district administration to organize the cattle fair despite the pandemic. âIf elections can be held amid Covid-19, why canât the fair be organized? It provides jobs to thousands of people for almost a month,â he said. "
"MUMBAI: The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), comprising the city and eight bordering civic corporations, touched six lakh coronavirus cases on Wednesday. MMR thus carries the heaviest burden in Maharashtra, but Mumbai can breathe easy in the knowledge that it now accounts for less than half the tally. After the outbreak in March, it took a month before most areas outside Mumbai began reporting infections. Since then, cases have spread more on the edges than inside the city. An addition of 1,832 cases on Wednesday took MMRâs caseload to 6,00,550 while the death toll stands at 18,164 with the addition of 41 casualties. Mumbai, with a population of 14 million, has 44% (2,66,748) of the cases and 10,506 deaths. Kalyan-Dombivli is the next most affected with 55,208 cases, followed by Navi Mumbai with nearly 50,000. In death rate, Bhiwandi-Nizampur leads with 5%, even higher than Mumbaiâs 3.9%. The stateâs overall fatality rate is 2.63%. Daily Covid-19 cases in city double during Diwali weekMumbai is seeing a near doubling of daily Covid-19 cases. After reporting around 500 on Monday and Tuesday, the tally jumped to 1,069 on Wednesday. BMCâs additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the spike was due to increased testing. âIf daily cases cross 2,000, that would be something to worry about,â he said. The death toll for the day was limited to 22. Dr Sanjay Oak, head of the stateâs Covid-19 taskforce, cautioned that the threat has far from dimmed. âIf people keep visiting their friends and relatives during Diwali without following masking and hygiene protocols, they will also end up sharing the virus apart from chakliand laddoos,âhe said. âIt would be unwise to think both for Mumbai and MMR that there may not be a surge,â he said. While other cities in the MMR such as Kalyan and Thane saw their first cases around the same time as Mumbai (March11), most began to experience a spurt in April and May. In Navi Mumbai, cases surged in the second week of May and the following week in neighbouring Panvel. In July, regions outside of Mumbai reported a near doubling. But by September, both Mumbai and other MMR corporations had started registering a decline. MMR (excluding Mumbai) has contributed 56% (3,33,802) of the six lakh cases in the region and 7,658 deaths. The last one lakh cases in MMR came in 37 days, the longest it has taken compared to previous additions on the same scale. Dr Oak said commissioners and collectors from MMR and Mumbai often meet to discuss measures. Kakani said Mumbai and adjoining satellite cities are one unit in the war against coronavirus. âAll these cities are closely interlinked, and we try to have similar interventions. We have also urged them to not shut Covid centres, that will help us tackle any surge together,â he said. Overall, Maharashtra reported 4,907 cases on Wednesday after 3,277 and 3,791 on Monday and Tuesday respectively. Total tally is 17,31,833. And thereâs a near doubling in deaths. On Wednesday, 125 were recorded after 46 on Tuesday, its lowest in six months. (Inputs by BB Nayak, Pradeep Gupta, Manoj Badgeri) "
"BENGALURU: The Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) among seniors in two groups â aged above 60 years and above 100 â in Karnataka has decreased, although the number of infections among those in the category increased in the past month. Of the 12,051 Covid-19 deaths in Karnataka as of December 26, 59.7% were seniors, even as this age group accounts for only 15% of the 9.1 lakh cases, reiterating the high vulnerability of people in this category. Comparatively, as of November 28, seniors accounted for 61% of the nearly 11,800 deaths. CFR among four of the five age groups seniors are grouped under has fallen compared to November-end and the overall CFR rate too has seen a marginal decrease to 4.9% from 5.1%. Given that this group of people were expected to be the most vulnerable, experts say that decline in CFR is encouraging. Analysis of data shows that among the 1.4 lakh seniors infected (as of December 26), the youngest (in their 60s) and the oldest (centenarians) have the lowest CFR. While CFR has reduced in both categories compared to last month, the trend is similar to what was seen in November. Doctors told TOI that even those who have died in these categories are those with comorbidities. While access to healthcare and early detection may have helped those in their 60s, low fatality rate among centenarians is attributed to good genes and mild infection among other things. Data shows patients in their 60s continue to account for about 63% of cases among senior citizens but now account for only 46.8% deaths, compared to 49% of the deaths among seniors in November. Centenarians account for 0.04% of both number of cases and deaths. Although the number of infections increased to 63 from 60, the number of deaths remained constant at three. Those in the 70-99 years group account for 37% of cases among seniors and 53% deaths. Groupwise, those in their 90s have the highest CFR at 11.3%, which is marginally lower compared to November. Patients in the 80s have a CFR of 9.4%, the only one to have seen an increase from 9% in November, while those in their 70s maintained the same CFR at 6.2%. "

"PATNA: Four super speciality clinics were inaugurated at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) on Saturday, including one dedicated to post-Covid treatment. The other three are liver, kidney and cornea clinics. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the clinic for post-Covid-19 treatment was first of its kind in Bihar. âEven after recovering from Covid-19, people suffer from weakness, lung problems, cardio problems, vertigo and stress. These people had to run from one place to another for treatment. Hence we decided to come up with such a health facility so that all their problems are addressed under one roof,â Dr Mandal said. âIn the post-Covid clinic, there will be experts of general medicine, pulmonary medicine, neuro medicine, cardiology department and physiotherapy department, which can be accessed with a registration fee of Rs 50,â he added. Dr Mandal said nearly 40% of people who had recovered from Covid-19 required post-recovery treatment. IGIMS director Dr NR Biswas inaugurated the post-Covid-19 treatment clinic. Dr Biswas had earlier contracted the virus and also suffered from post-Covid symptoms. He was the first patient at this clinic. He said he too was suffering from various health issues and felt patients like him had to wander from one place to another for treatment. In another development, the body 69-year-old Bhagya Chandra Jain was donated to the IGIMS on Saturday. Hospital administration appreciated the efforts of Dadhichi Deh Dan Samiti for this donation. Jain, a resident of SP Verma Road had taken the pledge to donate his body.

"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 803 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, the lowest since August 17 when the city had recorded 787 new cases. On Sunday, 62,440 tests were conducted, including 34,288 RT-PCR tests and 28,152 rapid antigen tests, the state health department said. Health minister Satyendar Jain said Delhi witnessed a lowest positivity rate of 1.29% for the first time in eight months on Monday. âWe still need to take precautions to stay safe!â he tweeted. This is the seventh consecutive day when the positivity rate in the city has remained below 2%. The tally of active cases on Monday dropped to 9,255 cases, the first time since August 4 when the number stood at 9,897. The total number of cases of Covid-19 is 6.17 lakh. The toll stands at 10,304, including 27 deaths reported in the last 24 hours, officials said. While the positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% since December 2, the death rate has been a cause of concern, but that figure too has been dipping compared to the high fatality rate witnessed during the peak of the third wave of Covid-19 last month. Of the total active cases, latest data shows, 5,405 are recuperating in home isolation and 2,909 are admitted in hospitals, apart from 112 in Covid care centres and 26 in Covid health centres.

"BENGALURU: The market for Corona-Kavach policies has grown 10-fold in a month to 1.1 crores from 15 lakh. A record sales figure that makes it the hottest selling insurance product in decades. Irdai chairman S C Khuntia announced the figure while addressing a CII meeting on Thursday. While there have been a few group health purchasers, the overwhelming majority of sales is coming from individual retail customers. âGrowth in corona-specific policies are driven by rising Covid-19 cases, with continuous uncertainty and a surge in related medical expenses,â said Subrata Mondal, EVP and head underwriting, IFFCO Tokio General Insurance. Media reports on hospitalsâ bills have played a role, say insurers. âAbout 75% of customers are preferring to take sum insured of Rs 2-5 lakh. Only a quarter are taking coverage below Rs 2 lakh,â said Gurdeep Singh Batra, head - retail underwriting, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. Insurers also say that many customers are first-time buyers. âMore than half the customers who have approached us for Corona Kavach are new to insurance. Since Corona Kavach only has a maximum sum insured of Rs 5 lakh, if people feel that is not sufficient then they take a comprehensive family plan,â says Batra. As Corona Kavach policies have a maximum sum insured, most people were buying it as an individual cover and not family floater (as only one personâs hospital bill could exhaust Corona Kavach). But with heightened insecurity, people are now turning to comprehensive insurance plans with family floater option, said insurers. "

"AHMEDABAD: A 69-year-old man from the Satellite area of city on Saturday committed suicide around one and a half months after his wife died of corona. According to police, he was completely shattered after the death of his wife. Satellite police have registered a case of accidental death. The deceased was identified as Piyush Desai, a resident of Azad Apartment-1 in Satellite. âThe incident came to light on Saturday evening when some neighbours found him unresponsive. They looked from a window and found him hanging from a ceiling fan,â said an officer of Satellite police. Investigating officer of the case, sub-inspector M G Limbola of Satellite police said that Desaiâs wife had died around one and a half months ago after which he was left alone. âHe did not have any kids or relatives who could live with him. So after his wifeâs death, he was lonely which triggered the extreme step,â said Limbola. He said that Desai had retired around nine years ago and he and his wife were living a happy life till coronavirus took her life. âWe have been facing trouble in investigating the issue as he did not have any family member who could tell us about his condition. So, we are relying on his neighboursâ accounts,â said a cop of Satellite police. "
"Ahmedabad: In the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, a couple from the city were scared of the viral infection and cases were reported around them. A close neighbour had also tested positive. They thus stepped up their âpreventive measuresâ. On the suggestion of relatives, they maintained a cycle of doing steam inhalation every four hours. It was not only for the two of them though â they also started inhalation for their three-year-old. Once, while getting a steam at 2am, the boy accidentally upset the hot water vessel and scalded himself. The boy suffered 16% burns and had to be treated at a hospital. This is one of the 16 cases documented by a team of doctors led by Dr Vijay Bhatia, head of the plastic and reconstructive surgery department at SVP Hospital, which was published recently in IJCMCR. The co-authors were Kena MP, Sruja DN and Ranjit RZ. The team took into consideration the period from March to August and analysed 16 cases of burns due to steam inhalation. âThere is no direct evidence that steam inhalation can prevent or cure Covid-19. But this is a popular belief and many from the city and state have started taking it as a preventive measure. A large section uses a vessel containing hot water for the purpose. While steam directly doesnât cause severe burns, the hot water does,â said Dr Bhatia. âWe used to see 2-3 such cases every year during the winter months. Now, in five months, we witnessed 16 cases, or one case every 10 days.â The researchers concluded that the traditional method of steam inhalation was employed by many especially during the lockdown months. But leaning over the vessel is dangerous and instead electrical appliances should be used if itâs used for symptomatic relief from common cold. They added that burns have both physical and emotional impact on the patients. The temperature of a vessel containing hot water is over 100 degrees celsius and could lead to second-degree burns, they added. "
"NEW DELHI: India has significantly ramped up daily vaccinations against Covid-19 with over 5.7 lakh beneficiaries vaccinated successively on Thursday and Friday, while more than 10,000 sessions were conducted on both the days. On Saturday, however, the number of beneficiaries inoculated dropped to around 2,06,130 till evening, with the Centre advising states to further boost the number of vaccinations and expand coverage through multiple concurrent sessions. So far, 37,06,157 beneficiaries have been inoculated through 68,830 sessions in just about a fortnight, making India the fastest country to reach not only the one million target but also two million and three million marks in Covid-19 vaccination. The Centre also advised states to use Aadhaar-based authentication as the preferred mode of verification of beneficiaries prior to the vaccination. Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan held a review meeting with state health secretaries and MDs of the National Health Mission. Underlining the huge scope for improvement in the number of average vaccinations per session, he said though some states have over 50% coverage, there are many who need to improve their performance. State health secretaries were asked to analyse the daily variation in the number of average vaccination and take steps to increase them. India launched its vaccination drive against Covid-19 on January 16 and aims to first inoculate three crore health and frontline workers. While so far only healthcare workers were being inoculated, now frontline workers will also start getting the doses from first week of February. The government had initially targeted only 5,000 sessions per day by end of January. However, with a consistent supply of vaccines, states and big hospitals were allowed to start multiple sessions to be able to accelerate vaccination. The Centre has also asked district immunisation officers to interact with the nodal officer at the session sites on a regular basis to evaluate the scope of this enhancement. He pointed out that vaccines are available in sufficient quantity and technical glitches on Co-WIN have also been resolved. The importance of timely data reconciliation was also emphasised upon during the detailed review meeting. "
"HYDERABAD: Though the renewal and sale of standard corona policies is expected to decline in the coming days due to falling Covid-19 cases, it is not likely to have a negative bearing on the overall growth of health insurance sector, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) chairman Subhash C Khuntia said on Friday. Addressing participants virtually at the 17th Annual Insurance Brokersâ Summit, organised by Insurance Brokers Association of India (IBAI), Khuntia pointed out that the standard Covid-19 policies were introduced to protect the uninsured as a âstop gapâ arrangement during the pandemic and has been serving their purpose. He said the pandemic has made people realise the importance of having adequate health coverage and is expected to boost overall health insurance in the near-term. He pointed out that 1.28 crore standard Covid policies with a total premium of over Rs 1,000 crore have been sold so far. âUnder Corona Kavach, which is the standard product, 42 lakh lives have been protected, while 5.36 lakh lives have been protected through Corona Rakshak,â Khuntia said. The IRDAI chairman also urged brokers to enhance their contribution towards life insurance as well as individual health insurance in the country. He also urged the broker community to leverage digital tools to reach out to the stakeholders and customers. âI see a huge opportunity in the tier 2 and 3 cities and towns. Substantial economic growth is expected from rural areas and I would urge the broker community to penetrate this untapped segment. Further focus is required on the MSME sector and new insurance products have been added to cater to this,â he said. He said brokers must represent the interest of customers and assist policyholders during the life cycle of the policies. âThough you have got the policy holder insured, you must also guide them on how to prevent risk against which they are insured,â he added.

"PUNE: A drop in the number of new cases has led to a massive fall in daily generation of Covid-19 biomedical waste within Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Latest data shows daily waste generation has fallen by nearly 66% â from 6,000 kg per day in September to at least 2,000 kg in December. An official from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board said, âAverage daily generation of Covid biomedical waste in the PMC area in November and December fell to 2,000 kg-3,000 kg from Octoberâs 4,000 kg-5,000 kg. In September, volume of per day Covid waste from PMC area was 6,000 kg.â Officials attributed the drop to the reduction in number of hospitalised patients. A heath department official said, âNearly 60% of active cases in Pune district are in home isolation. This has led to reduced use of PPE in hospitals. Currently, the region has 6,150 patients in home isolation, while 2,700 are in hospitals. In September, the number of patients at home was much less.â The official added that in October, the ratio of hospitalised and home-isolated patients was 50:50 in the district. âIt is now 60:40,â he said. Sunil Dandawate, who runs the cityâs common biomedical waste treatment facility, at Kailas Crematorium, said, âThe volume of Covid-related biomedical waste has indeed reduced. But non-Covid incinerable waste has increased in PMC limits, to 3,200-3,500 kg per day from at least 2,800 kg per day (when cases were on a rise). This is because regular admissions have resumed at many hospitals.â "

"MANGALURU: Although its healthcare system is far more advanced that most other districts in the state, Dakshina Kannadaâs case fatality rate (CFR) is highest in the state and is even higher than the state average, the national average and that of many other states and Union territories in the country. As on Monday, the district had recorded 668 Covid-19 fatalities from a total of 29,185 infections â case mortality rate of 2.2%, far higher than the national average (79.9 lakh cases and 1.2 lakh deaths) of 1.5%.

Their numbers are also added to the district tally.â He said even some deaths due to accidents or other incidents are added to the Covid-19 tally. âMany road and other accident victims test positive posthumously and they are also added to the tally,â said Bairy. Despite a high CFR, DK stands fourth highest in the number of cases in Karnataka. Bengaluru Urban, Mysuru and Ballari share the first three places. DKâs death rate was at its peak at the end of April (13.6%) and reduced to 1.6% in June. The mortality rate again increased to 2.4 % in July and currently stands at 2.2%.

"WASHINGTON: US coronavirus cases crossed the 15 million mark on Tuesday as regulators moved a step closer to approving a vaccine. President-elect Joe Biden, setting ambitious goals to change the course of the coronavirus pandemic, vowed on Tuesday to get âat least 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American peopleâ during his first 100 days in office, and said he would make it a ânational priorityâ to get kids back to school during that time. The pledge, which Biden made while introducing the members of his health team in Wilmington, Delaware, tracks with the goals set by President Trump. But in creating clear bench marks for himself, Biden is taking a certain risk. He will undoubtedly be held to the 100 million promise at the 100-day mark on April 30, and fulfilling it will require no hiccups in manufacturing or distributing the vaccine and a willingness by Americans to be vaccinated. Bidenâs announcement came as fresh details emerged about how Pfizer, the pharma giant whose vaccine could receive regulatory approval in the US this weekend, repeatedly urged the Trump administration to lock in a bigger supply. Before the vaccine was proved successful in clinical trials, the administration repeatedly turned down the chance to expand its pre-order beyond the 100 million doses it agreed to buy from Pfizer last July. The administration is now seeking to double the pre-order; otherwise it will run out of Pfizerâs vaccine by around March, according to people familiar with the talks. But Pfizer may not be able to deliver more doses for Americans until as late as June because the firm signed deals with other governments, including the EU. Pfizer, a US firm, too could face a consumer backlash if other nations are using its vaccine while Americans are forced to wait. "

"AHMEDABAD: Itâs not just the lungs or heart or other internal organs that are bearing the brunt of the Covid-19 infection, it could also be your teeth! City-based experts said that the recovered Covid patients are also showing signs of distress when it comes to fungal infection of jaws or bleeding in gums. Dr Arvind Agarwal, an oral-maxillofacial surgeon in Ahmedabad and former professor at a dental college in Visnagar, said that some of the recovered patients had fungal infection of jaws. âThose with co-morbidities such as diabetes and those who have received high doses of steroids are more vulnerable. It gets developed as the patientâs immunity is low,â he said, adding that the infection, identified as mucormycosis of jaw, spreads fast and can infect gums, bone and dental tissues. The teeth in affected patients can be painful and bleeding of gums is also reported. The experts also pointed at poor oral hygiene for the patients who are on prolonged oxygen or ventilator and they develop infection in the mouth. Dr Milan Dalal, a city-based dental surgeon, said that in conditions like cancer or treatment involving bisphosphonet drugs, the necrosis (death of body tissue) of bones is observed. âCovid-19 affects the blood supply and severe infection can cause similar effect. As the blood vessels get narrower, even a milder infection like dental decay can get aggravated,â he said, adding that the infection can flare up or spread fast. âIt is advisable to maintain oral health during and after the infection and also consult experts when experiencing acute pain or discomfort.â Courts to stay closed in honour of Justice Udhwani The Gujarat high court on Sunday announced that all courts across the state will remain closed on Monday due to the demise of sitting high court judge, Justice G R Udhwani.

"Jaipur: Stateâs second worst Covid-affected district, Jodhpur is on a mission with its âcorona-free wardâ strategy. Jodhpurâs pandemic situation started worsening from October 30 to November 5, when the cases were doubling in 106 days, since then the doubling rate became a cause of concern.

Aiming at flattening the curve, Jodhpurâs district collector Inderjeet Singh is spearheading the âcorona-free wardâ campaign. Teams of auxillary nurse midwives, ASHA and anganwadi workers along with sanitation inspectors, police beat constables and public representatives have a task in hand to reach out to each and every household in Jodhpur. Jodhpur South is the worst-affected and the focus will be on door-to-door survey in the municipal wards of the area. âCorona-free ward is a strategy devised by the district administration under which we have to conduct door-to-door survey aiming to minimise the number of Covid cases in worst-affected wards,â said Dr Balwant Manda, chief medical health officer, Jodhpur. Jodhpur and Jaipur are the two districts which are under the watchful eyes of the Centre.

"PATNA: At a time when the companies are resorting to financial restructuring by laying off employees and their salary cuts in order to survive the economic crisis induced by Covid-19, premier colleges in the city are finding it increasingly difficult to get their students placed amid the pandemic. Rishikesh Kumar, assistant professor at NIFT Patna, said the textile and fashion industry has suffered losses due to the pandemic and that has directly reflected in their placement drive in 2020. âThe economic slowdown has affected the businesses of our regular recruiters as they had to abruptly shut down their operations in March. Many of our final year students were not able to finish their internships as well. Hence, the chances of pre-placement offer are lost. The placement drive for the 2020 batch is still going on as many of the students are yet to be recruited,â Kumar said. Kriti K, assistant professor of management at Chanakya National Law university Patna (CNLU), said even though the placement committee at CNLU reached out to 60 firms this year, their response has been grim. The only positive development is that the companies that have offered jobs before the pandemic have not rescinded any so far. âEven though the date of joining given by many companies has been deferred owing to the travel restrictions, no job offers have been revoked so far,â said Kirti. While placement for the 2020 batch was a cakewalk for NIT Patna, things seem a little difficult for the 2021 batch. Samrat Mukherjee, professor in charge of training & placement at NIT Patna, said, âFor the batch of 2020, more than 60 companies came to campus and 93% of students were placed. But for the batch of 2021, I cannot say anything at the moment. A few corporate giants have recruited from campus while four to five are lined up in the coming weeks. But if I compare the situation to last year, we had three times more companies coming to our campus by this time.â "

"KOZHIKODE: âMy father was a traditional healer who would chant a mantra while dispensing medicine to the patients. It is a belief that the incantatory power of words can have an impact on the human beings,â said the poet Girish Puliyoor, whose new poem is on the Covid-19 pandemic. The poem âCorona Theyyamâ was written with the hope that the evil that has gripped the world could be exorcised through the magical spell of words. âHuman history is marked by our struggle with natural forces and at times coming into terms with them. The chequered history of human beings is marked by the fights with diseases like smallpox that threatened to devour humanity,â Girish said. One way of survival was to surrender before the natural forces and to appease them. âAayiram Villi in our village in Puliyoor in Thiruvananthapuram and Theyyam in north Kerala epitomise the natural force. We have concepts like Muthu Mariyamma and Vasoori Mala Theyyam,â he said. The poem is written in the form of human beings prostrating before Mother Earth. âThe disease is visualised in the poem as the punishment by the mother for the series of wickedness committed that put the existence of earth in danger. Finally, the mother decides to eliminate the children to save the earth for posterity,â Girish said. But after all, like any mother, the earth also is kind and considerate. âShe cannot turn deaf to the loud cries of her children who have realised their mistake and have repented. The fierce and the merciful co-exists in the same deity,â Girish said. The poem was composed in March, during the lockdown. âI could only record the poem ten days ago,â he said. Girish is in isolation after the staff at the studio tested positive. âThe orchestration is done by Jayan Pisharody and the poem is written and sung in the form of the âThottamâ of the Theyyam. Thottam is rendered in a loud voice as it should be audible for the entire public assembled in the Kavu. And it is in the simple form because it should be comprehensible to even the laymen,â he said. "
"BHUBANESWAR: Although the daily Covid count in the state has shown a decline, the fatalities remain steady at 15 per day on an average. On Monday, 16 people succumbed to the infection, taking the number of deaths in the state to 1,543. A total of 749 people tested positive for Covid-19, raising the virus caseload to 3,09,408. The daily Covid case count has stayed below 1,000 since Friday. Experts said fatalities may increase in winter as those with respiratory distress and comorbidities would be even more vulnerable. So far, Khurda district has reported the highest number of 268 deaths followed by Ganjam (232) and Cuttack (124). Other districts that have reported close to 100 deaths are Sundargarh, Puri and Balasore with 99, 90 and 79 fatalities, respectively. Jayant Panda, the governmentâs technical adviser on Covid-19, said the virus has several strains, of which some are more virulent. âThatâs the reason behind the fatalities remaining static despite the fall in the number of new cases. The mutant strain of the virus is causing fatalities. Other reasons are comorbid conditions, delayed reaction and treatment and hiding of symptoms. The unpredictability of the virus still very much persists,â he told TOI. âThe number of cases being reported daily is not directly linked to the fatalities. In many states , fatalities are increasing. In others, they are on the decline. As far as Odisha is concerned, deaths are static,â he added. In spite of recording around 15 deaths on an average daily, Odisha is one of the states with the lowest death rate. At 0.46 per cent, Odishaâs fatality rate is lower than the national rate of 1.2 per cent. Most deaths have been reported in the age group of 41 to 60 years. Health experts, however, have time and again cautioned against delayed reaction of people to the symptoms. âIn most asymptomatic cases, the lungs are not likely to be affected much and hence there is no need to panic,â an expert said. They also said many young people with obvious Covid symptoms are not going for tests and were coming to hospital in a critical condition. âTheir (youngstersâ) complacency and overconfidence put them in trouble. Many elderly people and persons with comorbidities are recovering due to timely intervention,â the experts added. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said five strains of the Covid-19 virus have been detected in Odisha till August. âGenome sequencing is continuing and we will be able to say whether there are more strains after studying the genome sequencing pattern of September and October,â he said. Doctors have been stressing on the need to quickly recognise the symptoms of Covid. âWithin 48 hours of having symptoms, one should either consult a doctor and start medication at home or get hospitalized depending on severity. People should strictly avoid cross-practice like taking medicines of allopathy, Ayurveda and homoeopathy till the test results come,â doctors said. "

"JAIPUR: With the number of Covid cases dipping, corona warriors in the state, especially doctors and paramedical staff, have got some time to get back to their families. Some of them had to postpone their weddings and honeymoon, while some could not attend the funeral of their kin while some others were unable to meet their newly born kids. However, in this month so far they are little relieved as the caseload on hospitals has eased. Dr Satish Mishra, a corona warrior posted at the chief medical and health officer, Jaipur, joined the duty leaving his pregnant wife Neha Mishra at home in March 2020. âMy son was born on October 21, but I could only see him through video calls and pictures sent to me by my wife. I have, so far, visited my family once on November 19 at my native village near Chomu when there were some rituals to be performed. But now I have applied for leave and also to relieve me to my original posting at Chomu. Hopefully, by the end of this month, I would be able to get back to my home and meet him,â Mishra said. Mishra had been a frontline warrior while extensive contact tracing was on, especially at Ramganj and Aadarsh Nagar areas, in April. âSince then we have been living in a hotel. I now hope to take my son in my lap as things are improving,â he added. Hemant, personal assistant to Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal, SMS medical college, had to postpone his wedding twice before he finally got married on December 9 last year. âEven for marriage, I took just two days leave. Now, I have planned to go for honeymoon from January 27 to February 5. Hopefully, with dip in cases, I may get leave for honeymoon,â he added. Likewise, some of the doctors and paramedical staff could not give time to their families due to strict quarantine rules. âMy wife has some orthopaedic problem, but I kept postponing a doctorâs appointment since April 2020. I took my wife to the hospital on Friday. It was actually tiresome and also since we are working at RUHS, we had to keep ourselves in isolation,â said Dr Shashi Kant, nursing superintendent, RUHS. Similarly, 25% staff from RUHS has been relieved and are allowed to go back to their original postings at satellite hospitals, primary health centres and community health centres. âWe are relieving doctors and paramedical staff on first-come-first-serve basis. They have been working tirelessly with us for a long time. Many of them have applied for leaves from three days to seven days to spend some time with their families,â said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent, RUHS, a Covid-dedicated hospital. "
"Ahmedabad: Flute legend Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia told TOI on Tuesday that the pandemic must not mute music. Mohan Veena maestro Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt added an authoritative flourish while talking to TOI: âMusic must prevail!â The two classical icons were reacting to the news that Saptak, the annual music festival held in Ahmedabad, was going online in its next edition beginning January 1, 2021. Saptak, which runs till January 13, is Indiaâs longest classical music conference. The event brings to Ahmedabad figures from the pantheon of Hindustani and Carnatic traditions. Apart from Pandits Chaurasia and Bhatt, those who have performed on the Saptak stage include Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Vidushi Shubha Mudgal, Pandit Jasraj, and Pandits Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Carnatic stalwarts who have held Amdavadi rasikas in thrall include the Ranjani-Gayatri duo, T M Krishna, and the violinist, Vidhwan Kumaresh. âFor the 2021 edition, we have cut the baithaks from three to two,â said Manju Mehta, the Saptak custodian. âOtherwise everything will be the same â the dates, and the 8.30pm start.â Prafull Anubhai, a Saptak trustee, said: âThe first session will feature an established artist. The finale will star a musical titan.â For the forthcoming Saptak, artists will record their expositions either at home or at studios. The concerts will be streamed on Shaale. The musiciansâ list is expected to be settled in the coming days. âThis is an opportunity to take our music to the world,"" Pandit Bhatt said. Pandit Chaurasia said though going online was the most feasible option, he will miss the crackling interactions with Amdavadi rasikas. âI look forward to enjoying that when things get normal,â he said.

"AHMEDABAD: Is it possible to quickly assess the severity of Covid-19 patients before assigning them wards? Can there be a universal practice through which doctors and patients can communicate with each other about symptoms and severity? These were some of the questions a team of doctors from Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) at the Civil Hospital campus started working on to form a sort of universal language which they have termed âABCD.â The concept â which resulted in two academic papers that were published in international journals â also found a place in the World Health Organization (WHO) repository on research papers related to Covid-19 on Thursday. The authors included Dr Abhijeet Salunke, Dr Vikas Warikoo and Dr Shashank Pandya from GCRI among other experts from Pune, Ambala and Rajnandgaon. âIn the simplest of form, we can explain the system as a scoring of factors including age, body ache, body temperature, contact, cough, co-morbidities and dyspnoea, which makes up âABCDâ. Patients and doctors are asked to mark each factor with 0 or 1,â said Dr Salunke. âIf the score is 0-3, the patient has mild symptoms, if itâs 4-6, itâs moderate, and if itâs above 6, itâs severe.â In mild cases, patients can be advised isolation at home, in moderate cases they can be directed to a doctor and if symptoms are severe, the patients need to be shifted to an ICU. Dr Shashank Pandya, director of GCRI, said that almost all triage areas (the first section of Covid-19 hospitals where the severity of the patientsâ condition is assessed and they are assigned wards) have their own systems based on the severity of the infection, HRCT scan results and the condition of the patient.

"Bhopal: Health worker, TS Mishra, came forward to take the coronavirus vaccine, a day after only 18% turnout was reported in JP hospital. It was the third day of inoculation at the district hospital. Call it auspicious or credit to the counselling skills of people like Mishra who got vaccinated, since then, the hospitalâs vaccine trend has moved in only one direction, upwards!Talking about his experience, the 60-year-old Mishra said: âI was more than willing to get the first shot (when vaccination started on January 16). My family were in agreement. The fact is sooner or later we all have to get vaccinated to defeat Covid-19.â Knowing peopleâs apprehensions about the vaccine, Mishra has been trying to motivate others to take the jab. He has been with the MP health department for 31 years and his coming forward to get the vaccine has been a source of inspiration for many others. Going by health department estimates, it takes about six minutes for each person to get the jab. âStaff nurses, sanitation workers and others approached me to ask about my situation after getting the jab. I returned to work the next day after vaccination,â Mishra told TOI. He has been honest about his experience, recalling that he felt a little discomfort at the vaccination spot and low temperature. âIt is the same like taking any other injection,â he said with a proud smile and was quick to remind others to keep wearing a face mask, stay at least 6 feet away from everyone and wash hands frequently.âWe have to strive for both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity â that is the way forward to return to normalcy,â he added. Mishra is now awaiting the second vaccine dose."

""If someone has Covid-19 symptoms, for example fever, cough or difficulty breathing, he or she should get tested immediately. Also, those under home isolation should be under medical supervision. Deterioration of symptoms can be sudden and, therefore, patients need to be watchful of warning signs such as irregular heart beat or sudden loss of consciousness,"" said a health expert. "
"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday concluded its hearing and reserved its order on a petition filed by third-year MBBS students from colleges run by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) challenging the mandatory Covid-19 duty as âcorona sahayaksâ. During the proceedings, the government said that the studentsâ Covid duty would not continue once academic activities at the colleges begin. However, on part of the students it was argued that when colleges will resume teaching has not yet been decided. Moreover, they will not get enough time to prepare for their exams, though a decision to postpone the exams for three months has been taken. The students continued to question the AMC decision mandating that students of NHL Medical College and LG Medical College join Covid-19 duty. They submitted that students in 20 other medical colleges across the state were asked to join voluntarily. For the students, advocate Anand Yagnik also requested the court for a certificate regarding permission to move the Supreme Court, arguing that ordering compulsory Covid duty for students is an unreasonable restriction. In reply to the petition, the AMC said that the studentsâ services are required to perform antigen tests, as the government plans to go in for mass testing.

"INDORE: The district is heading towards another peak, which will be a prolonged one, after a plateau of about a month, say experts. They attributed the surge in Covid-19 cases to election rallies, festive gatherings in markets. Indore has been reporting an increase in daily positive cases since November 4 and in the last three days the cases have surged to 313 on Thursday from 178 on November 16. âThe sudden and sharp rise in daily infections was expected after huge political rallies during campaigning for bypolls,â said Dr Rajshekhar Wavare, community medicine expert. The surge in cases at the moment is because of those rallies as the incubation period of virus is around 15 days. The effect of Navratri has also started to appear but it will take another 15-20 days for Diwali impact to be seen, said Dr Wavare. The situation is expected to remain same till December-end because of the decline in temperature in winter. So, this time the period of peak will remain a little longer than the earlier one, said Dr Wavare. âAt present, we are in post-festival period and the surge in cases of Covid-19 has been anticipated due to huge gatherings,â said MGMâs community medicine HoD Dr Salil Sakalle. The situation will last till December 15 because the effect will appear till that period, said Dr Sakalle. On what steps district administration should take to curb the spread, Dr Wavare suggests, âThe administration should try something like night curfew or on weekends along will banning huge gatherings like marriage functions and other public occasions.â Dr Sakalle said, âDefinitely, there should be some restrictions at least for marriage gatherings, religious places and some market places because June remained a magical month for district with very low positivity rate of around 2% and least number of cases amidst pandemic.â On precautionary measures to tackle the virus spread, Dr Sakalle said, âMasks, social distancing, frequent sanitization of hand and immediate reporting to doctor in case of symptoms are the steps that should be taken to prevent virus spreadâ "

"JAMSHEDPUR: Nearly a month after restaurants across Jamshedpur reopened for customers, the East Singhbhum district administration began a drive to screen the staff working at the eateries for Covid-19. âThe drive, which began on Friday, has covered 459 employees across 25 hotels and restaurants and will continue until everybody is screened,â said civil surgeon Dr R N Jha on Sunday. âThe purpose of the drive is to make sure every person working at hotels and restaurants get tested for the virus so we can stop the spread of and ensure timely treatment,â Jha said.

"KOLLAM: As long as 24-year-old Corona Thomas can remember nobody poked fun at her rather innocuous name all these years. But all of that started changing after a virus by that name started spreading rapidly across the world. âNow, many people joke about my name and give me peculiar looks. Some shout at me, Go Corona, go away!â Thomas, the BJP pick for Mathilil division of Kollam Corporation says local residents welcome her warmly during campaigning as she is already known to the voters. âMy unique name has made me popular and I have been featured on TV programmes,â she says. BJP supporters in the region say though the word corona denotes a relentless scourge, the voters in the Mathilil division will rather remember the strong and successful fight put up by Thomas against the pandemic. She has been able to instill courage among all those around her, they say. That was when the novel coronavirus started making its way into her neighborhood and her home. Besides herself and her husband, her parents too got infected. âAs I was in the advanced stage of pregnancy, we were all worried. I got admitted to Parippally Medical College Hospital on October 10. On October 15, I gave birth to my daughter. She too tested positive for the virus, adding to my concerns,â says Thomas. However, beating all odds, she managed to recover and returned home safely with her daughter after about 10 days. So, how did Corona come by her moniker? Corona says her father Thomas Francis, an artist, and mother Sheeba Thomas chose the name Corona for her, which means the aura around stars or the moon, after naming her twin brother, Coral Thomas. She got interested in BJP after her marriage to Jinu Suresh, a BJP worker, about six years ago. âItâs my interest in BJP politics that prompted me to contest on a BJP ticket,â says Corona. Asked about her winning prospects, she points out that the BJP candidate who was fielded from the Mathilil division during the last elections was defeated by a UDF candidate by a margin of only 175 votes.

"BHOPAL: Is Covid-19 steadily building up into a second wave in Madhya Pradesh? The question arises from the fact that Covid-19 cases which had gone drastically down in the month of October have been showing a steady increase in the past 14 days. There were only 8,298 active cases in the state on November 2, which has now increased to 9,146. Earlier on September 30, there were 20,997 active cases in the state and in the month of October it reduced to 8,929 (on October 31). It is after more than nearly two months that more than 1,000 positive cases were reported in a single days in state, that too consecutively for three days on November 14, 13 and November 12. In November, number of new positive cases started increasing since November 2, and barring two days November 2 and November 13, more cases were reported every day compared to previous days. So far in November, 12,568 new cases have been reported and only 12,212 patients have recovered. This is less compared to 43,212 new cases in October but what is heartening is that while 43,000 tested positive in October, 54,745 people recovered from the disease in the same month, drastically bringing down the number of active cases in the state. But now it is against going up, i.e., more people are testing positive and recoveries are less. Sources say that the numbers are still less, but it is likely to increase following the festivities of Diwali and the impact of the campaigning of bye-elections will also be visible. It is already visible, in Gwalior where the cases were going down, but since November 4, day after polls on November 3, the number of cases reported every day has increased significantly and more cases are reported everyday compared to previous days.

"NEW DELHI: With 6,842 people testing Covidpositive in the past 24 hours, Delhi on Wednesday recorded over 6,000 fresh cases for the second consecutive day. This is the highest single-tally till date in the city, followed by 6,725 cases recorded on Tuesday. According to government data, Wednesdayâs record-breaking numbers came out of 58,910 tests conducted in the past 24 hours. Of this, 14,574 (25%) tests were done using RT-PCR/CBNAAT/True Nat, which is considered gold standard for Covid-19 testing, while 44,336 (75%) were done using rapid antigen test kits, which gives result faster, but has lower sensitivity rate. The overall positivity rate, number of positive cases from those tested, stood at 11.6%, which is nearly four times the national average. The infection tally in Delhi crossed 4.1 lakh mark, while the death toll stood at 6,703. As many as 51 fresh fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours, said an official. Public health specialists warned that the new cases might rise further in the next few weeks as people continued to flock to markets for festive shopping. Cold weather and air pollution were acting as other key factors contributing to the spread of the virus, they added. According to a recent research published in International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH), particulate matter, a key pollutant, could create a suitable environment for transporting the virus to greater distances than those considered for close contact. âParticulate matter can also induce inflammation in lung cells, which can increase the susceptibility and severity of Covid-19 symptoms,â said scientists. âOur health infrastructure, especially critical care facilities, is already under duress. If Covid cases continue to surge, we may soon reach a breaking point when the system will not be able to handle the patient load. Therefore, it is important to be strict with adherence to preventive measures such as maintaining social distance and wearing masks,â said Dr J C Suri, director and head of pulmonology, Fortis Vasant Kunj. Many Covid patients develop early stage pulmonary-fibrosis or scarring of the pulmonary tissues. âThis results in decreased pulmonary functions. Air pollution consisting of various gases and suspending particles may cause further worsening of their respiratory symptoms, which may have longterm impact on lungs,â said DR Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care, Apollo Hospital.

"PATNA: Preparations for the Republic Day celebrations and parade are in full swing in the state capital. The district administration is busy making necessary arrangements while keeping the ânew normalâ in mind. The number of invitees would be restricted to ensure physical distancing norms and other Covid-19 protocols during the celebration. Altogether 10 tableaux (jhanki) of education, health, water resources, tourism, agriculture, art, culture and youth affairs, women development corporation and building construction departments besides IPRD and Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan would be displayed at Gandhi Maidan on January 26.The contingents to take part in the parade include CRPF, SSB, ITBP, CISF, district armed forces, BMP, home guards, NCC and fire brigade. The full dress rehearsal of the Republic Day parade will be held on January 24 at Gandhi Maidan. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh on Wednesday reviewed the preparations and issued several instructions. âAll the Covid-19 protocols will be strictly followed. The wearing of face masks, use of sanitisers and thermal screening would be ensured at the entrance. Social distancing would be maintained inside the ground. The officers concerned have been directed to ensure availability of medical team, safe drinking water and urinals,â he said. âAltogether 75 corona warriors will be honoured for their selfless contribution to the society during the pandemic. There will be a special gallery for them,â he added. The DM has instructed the officials concerned to ensure cleanliness, barricading, uninterrupted power supply, lighting, public address system, pruning of trees and proper seating arrangements. âTraffic police have been instructed to take precautionary measures related to the movement of vehicles on the road and make proper parking arrangements for vehicles near Gandhi Maidan,â Singh said. Deputy development commissioner Richie Pandey, traffic SP D Amarkesh, additional collector (legal systems) KK Singh and ADM Vinayak Mishra among the other officers were present at the review meeting.

"FRANKFURT: A boom in electric vehicles (EV) in Germany could counterbalance some car industry gloom this year caused by COVID-19 lockdowns that closed showrooms and delayed vaccinations, Hyundai said on Tuesday.  ""It is clear that new sales in January will be down from a year ago and 2021 is hard to gauge,"" said Juergen Keller, managing director of the South Korean carmaker's German arm in an interview.  ""But many customers are now open to EVs and I am convinced that the momentum will last,"" he said.  Momentum came from a Berlin government stimulus package in the summer to boost demand for a low-carbon economic recovery, which included moves to cut pollution from combustion engines.  In November, Berlin allocated 1 billion euros to extend to 2025 a buyer rebate for EVs that had been planned to end in 2021.  Hyundai Deutschland, which narrowly expanded its market share to 3.60% from 3.59% in 2019, benefited from the incentives, from a wider EV product range than German rivals and quick availability of its EVs.  Some 30.7% of its sales in 2020 were made up of electric or hybrid cars that combine batteries with combustion engines, while for German car sales overall, the share of alternative propulsion was 24.7%.  Hyundai saw a decline in lucrative private passenger cars by 6.4% in the year, compared with a fall seen across the German market of 12.9%.  In 2021, Hyundai will upgrade its EV portfolio, launch new EV models, having started supporting customers with wall box offerings for home charging and cooperating with utility EnBW , which provides electricity and EV payment systems.

"KARBALA: For millennia, Iraqis have turned to religion as they grieve their dead. This year, a pandemic and the killings of hundreds of young protestors have lent greater sorrow to the Shiite mourning ceremonies of Ashura. ""Iraq has been through so much misery -- from war to torture to imprisonment to forced emigration and now the coronavirus pandemic,"" said sheikh Hassan Dhakeri, a cleric in Iraq's shrine city of Karbala. Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims are marking a month of mourning for Hussein, the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, killed by followers of Caliph Yazid in the seventh century -- the seminal moment in Islam's Sunni-Shiite schism. Since then the country has been through relentless cycles of sadness. Many turn to religion for solace, Dhakeri said. Every year, thousands of Shiite Muslims mark Ashura with a pilgrimage to Imam Hussein's resting place inside a glittering shrine in the holy city of Karbala. Visitors are often so moved by the story of his death that they sob uncontrollably at the mausoleum's golden gates. ""When we make this pilgrimage, and we're carrying all our worries and tragedies and needs, we begin to cry,"" Dhakeri said. ""That is the first step to having our prayers answered."" In the last century alone, Iraq underwent several bloody changes of power that culminated in the rule of Saddam Hussein. Iraqis lived through war with Iran in the 1980s, crippling international sanctions in the 1990s and the US-led invasion of 2003, which brought sectarian infighting and the fight against the Islamic State group. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis fled their homeland and those who stayed endured violence and the destruction of critical infrastructure, healthcare and access to education. ""Iraq is a sad country. From Saddam's time until now, we haven't known joy,"" said Mohammad Karbalai, a 31-year-old religious chanter from Karbala. Every year, he performs poetic eulogies or emotional retellings of Hussein's death, a story Shiites see as representing the ultimate injustice, but also triumph over death. ""People feel that there is injustice but there is also good -- and that in the end, all throughout history, good always wins,"" Karbalai told AFP. It's a powerful message for Iraqi youth marking their first Ashura since nearly 600 people were killed in anti-government protests that erupted last October. This year, Ashura mourners have combined their religious rites with demands for justice, their eyes flashing with pain as they lift framed portraits of slain friends and relatives. ""Imam Hussein is the treatment for these wounds,"" Karbalai told AFP. Iraqis are also mourning more than 8,000 loved ones who have lost their lives to Covid-19, among nearly 300,000 confirmed cases in the country. In a bid to stem the spread of the virus, Iraq has kept its borders closed to non-residents and urged citizens not to attend large gatherings. But tens of thousands of Iraqis are estimated to have attended Ashura rituals in Karbala. Even higher numbers are expected to attend Arbeen in early October, marking the close of the traditional 40-day grieving period since Hussein's death. ""This year is an exceptional year because of the virus,"" said Riyad Salman, who heads the Department of Rituals at Karbala's shrines. The slender, blue-eyed Iraqi is usually responsible for organising thousands of prayer groups during Ashura. But this year, he led 30,000 shrine workers distributing medical masks, taking pilgrims' temperatures and spraying disinfectant mist over crowds of fervent worshippers. It changed the ambience at the shrines, but as a second deadly wave of Covid-19 sweeps the world, it may become the new normal. ""This year was fundamentally different. We felt a kind of frustration,"" he said. "
"LUCKNOW: The city continued to record the highest number of Covid-19 cases on Tuesday with 194 more persons testing positive for the novel coronavirus infection. The figure accounted for 19% of the total 1,044 cases in the state, which means every fifth infection in UP took place in Lucknow. The biggest contributors in Lucknow's tally were Gomtinagar and Indiranagar with 23 and 22 new cases respectively. These two areas have been recording high transmission rates since August. Other âhigh scorers' on Tuesday included Mahanagar 14, Jankipuram 12, Alambagh 11 and Aashiana 10, Hazratganj and Gudumba 10 each. While the high transmission rate remained a cause of concern, the number of deaths came down to one. Also, the number of recoveries (219) in the past 24 hours were more than the new cases. According to the state Covid bulletin, the caseload has now mounted to 78,070 and deaths 1,111 (over 1.4% of the caseload) since the outbreak in March. However, nearly 95% (74,123) of those infected by the virus, so far, have also recovered. As many as 2,836 patients are still battling with the disease. "
"MUMBAI: Covid-19 testing in the city has not witnessed a scale up to the extent seen in several other districts and even the state as a whole. Data shows that while testing grew by 69% in Maharashtra between July and August, it increased by a meagre 13% in Mumbai. From a little over 12 lakh tests carried out in Maharashtra in July, it rose to 20.8 lakh tests in August. Overall, Maharashtra has carried out 42.9 lakh tests. Whereas Mumbai that had carried out 2 lakh tests in July could only increase it to 2.3 lakh in August. The âstagnantâ Covid-19 testing figures became a political issue on Wednesday with the BJP accusing the BMC of failure to increase average daily tests. Public health minister Rajesh Tope, however, defended the testing numbers and said there was no question of going slow on testing. âWe are focusing on tracing and testing. For every positive patient, we want 20 high-risk contacts to be traced. And when you increase tracing you are automatically increasing testing. We have been very transparent about sharing all the data,â said Tope. He added that there are protocols set by the ICMR with respect to the use of antigen tests and the state government is strictly following those. In Mumbai, a civic official pointed out that districts in rest of Maharashtra are now witnessing a surge and therefore, will see more testing. âWe had gone upto 11,000 tests a day in the end of July when we were getting many cases. Even today, we are doing between 7,000 and 9,000 tests every day,â said a senior civic official, adding that unlike other districts, Mumbai is still relying mainly on the RT-PCR test, which is the gold standard. âAlso, BMC has done away with all restrictions and has made testing freely accessible much before other districts,â the official added. Mumbai, meanwhile, has recently got 50,000 rapid antigen kits and the BMC plans to procure 50,000 more shortly. Tope also said that there are nearly 450 RT-PCR labs in the state and efforts are being made to ensure they run at capacity. "
"AMARAVATI: Five more people who returned to Andhra Pradesh from the UK and eight of their contacts tested positive for coronavirus as 212 cases were reported afresh in the state in 24 hours ending 9am on Monday. The caseload in the state is now 8,81,273, according to the latest bulletin. After 410 patients got cured, the total recoveries went up to 8,70,752, it said. The state saw four fresh Covid-19 fatalities in a day, taking the overall toll to 7,098. State Health Commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar said 1,363 people had returned to AP from the UK in recent days of whom 1,346 were traced and 1,324 were sent to quarantine. Among the returnees, 11 tested positive for coronavirus, he said, adding they were awaiting test results from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, to determine if they carried the new strain. Bhaskar said 5,784 contacts of the UK returnees were also identified and tested, resulting in 12 positive cases so far. In 24 hours, Guntur district reported 53 new Covid- 19 cases, followed by 42 in Chittoor and 32 in Krishna. All other districts reported less than 25 new cases each, with six of them adding less than 10 each. For the second consecutive day, Vizianagaram district did not report any new case of the infection even as its active cases dropped below 50. West Godavari district reported two more deaths while Guntur and Visakhapatnam saw one fatality each. "
"JAIPUR: Doctors are opting for antibody test among Covid patients who have completed 14 days of isolation but still test positive in RT-PCR test. At Jaipurâs SMS Hospital, doctors have admitted two patients in post-Covid ward even though they are positive. Doctors say the RT-PCR test might give wrong results as it reads dead proteins in the blood and shows the patient as Covid-19 positive. In such cases, antibody test give a clearer picture. âEven after a patient has recovered from Covid, the RT-PCR detect dead protein of virus and shows that the patient is still positive. In such cases, antibody test is quite instrumental as it shows that the person was infected with the virus and recovered,â said Dr Ajit Singh, medical superintendent, dedicated Covid-19 RUHS Hospital. A lot of persons, who had fever and influenza-like illness earlier and are not aware that they had been infected with Covid-19 and have post-Covid complications, are also being recommended antibody test. âA positive antibody test suggests past Covid illness. Covid antibodies start forming as early as 7-10 days of infection and may last for 3 months. We need longer follow up studies to say till when they would last. In RT-PCR test, often the dead virus DNA also shows positive results in which case patient is not infectious,â said Dr Sheetu Singh, director Covid-19 pulmonary rehab, at a private hospital. She said RT-PCR may be positive for up to a month or more after acute Covid-19 infection. âThis is often seen in elderly patients, comorbid illnesses such as diabetes, obesity and those with severe illness,â said Dr Singh. Doctors are using the antibody test on patients who are continuously being tested positive for Covid through repeated RT-PCR tests. "

"BENGALURU: The number of children under the age of 10 years contracting Covid-19 is on the rise in Karnataka, data from the state Covid-19 War Room shows. In the one-month period ending 27 October, 8,528 children were infected, up from 7,410 in the preceding month. Doctors say the trend is worrying especially when the total number of infections is falling. While 2.7 lakh fresh infections were reported in the state between August 27 and September 27, the number fell to 2.3 lakh in the ensuing month. Parents heading out to work could be catching the infection and passing it on to their children at home, doctors say, adding that the bigger concern is of kids infecting grandparents and elders at home, who, given their age, are likely to have comorbidities and could pay a heavy price. So far 28 infected children below 10 years have died, eight in the past month alone. Some suffered comorbidities like cardiac ailments. Dr Natesh BH, secretary, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Karnataka chapter, ruled out transmission from children to children since kids are not going to schools. âThe transmission to children is largely through their parents,â Dr Natesh said. âParents take their kids to social occasions like family functions and end up exposing them to the virus. Parents have to exercise caution and ensure their children are safe.â As some children face multisystem inflammatory syndrome-Covid (MISC) when infected, Dr Natesh said they need to be admitted to hospitals once they show symptoms. While the state Covid technical advisory committee and the BBMP say children below five years need not wear masks, paediatricians say, preferably, everyone above two years of age should wear a mask. âChildren above two years should wear a mask especially when going out or if they are out in a crowd,â Dr Natesh said. Dr KS Sanjay, director, Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH), said paediatric patients from outside Bengaluru seeking non-Covid treatment are testing positive. âWe are not a dedicated Covid hospital, but all patients are tested for Covid before admission,â Dr Sanjay said. âInfected children are housed in a Covid ward. We have six such cases now. These children may have picked up the virus while travelling in buses from their hometowns and villages.â The increase in children being infected shows parents and caretakers are not following prevention protocols, says Dr SM Prasad, a Bengaluru-based paediatrician. He says when parents return home, they must have a head bath before interacting with their children. âThey must ensure children do not come in contact with used clothes and masks,â Dr Prasad said. âIf parents maintain hygiene standards, children will be safe, but many parents use hand sanitisers only, while the virus could be present in their clothes or bags which children may touch.â Indian Medical Association members say several paediatricians have been infected with Covid-19 and their possible source of infection could be screening of children with mild symptoms. Dr Prasad said that the stateâs daily bulletin on the pandemic must have a section where paediatric cases from the districts are listed to spread awareness. "
"BELAGAVI: Healthcare workers, the priority group, must furnish their Aadhaar cards to receive the Covid-19 vaccine as the government plans a biometric-based delivery system across the country, officials revealed. At the district level, the health department is gathering data on private and public healthcare workers on the frontline of the battle against the pandemic to generate a database for a centrally monitored Covid-19 vaccination beneficiary management system (CVBMS). This is an extension of the existing electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN) module for individualised tracking of all beneficiaries who receive the vaccine. Officials say the deadline to gather data at the district level is October 31. While the healthcare workersâ database guidelines in the new CVBMS system do not list Aadhaar details, it later states that the document musty be produced at the time of vaccination. Dr Rajesh, reproductive and child health officer, Mangaluru district, confirmed Aadhaar is mandatory during vaccination. However, for the database, identity proof like voter ID, licence, passport, pan card and others are sufficient. Dr Rajesh, however, said the government is yet to notify a set of rules and regulations for a biometric-based vaccine delivery system. Dr Sashikanth Muniyal, district health officer, Belagavi, said, âThe department already has every detail on each government employee, but now we are collecting data from contract and private workers.â The government is generating a comprehensive nationwide centralised data system on healthcare and it will include private establishments too, officials say. District health and family welfare offices will upload details on health facilities, both government and private, like primary healthcare centres, community health centres, corporate hospitals, nursing hospitals, polyclinics, OPD clinics and medical colleges in the private segment. Names, location and postal address of these facilities will be collected. The health department is also collecting details such as name, gender, date of birth, proof of ID (with photo), mobile numbers, postal code and employee ID of healthcare workers. Interestingly, healthcare workers will have to furnish mobile numbers linked to Aadhaar cards. In case s/he does not have such a number, then numbers of family members or friends â linked to Aadhaar â can be given.  While the registry appears a bright idea, Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, general physician, raised questions on the safety of the data and transparency of the system. âThe government only needs the exact number of healthcare workers and not their personal details to estimate the number of vaccines required,â Dr Kakkilaya said. âWe do not know who is accessing this mammoth data which has every potential to be misused, especially in this era of cybercrimes. The top brass in the health sector must question the intention behind gathering this data.â "
"In the wake of coronavirus pandemic, members of Prayaas Foundation distributed corona safety kits to the corona warriors in Alwar, Rajasthan. The police personnel doing their duties in Alwar were given immunity booster kaada by the members, approved by the Ministry of AYUSH. Sachin Tiwari, president of Prayaas Foundation, said, âOne year ago, we started this group with only 5 people with an aim to do something for the society. We decided to use some part of our salaries to buy stuff for needy people. Slowly, people started noticing our love towards the society and in a few months, this foundation became a family of more than 100 people. Now, it has 135 people including men and women.â He further added, âThe most beautiful thing about these young lads is that they are not relying to run this foundation on money from their home. Ever since the coronavirus outbreak, we have been helping people. This time, we decided to do something for our corona warriors.â Shrey Bhardwaj, Kapil Sharma, Ravi Sharma, Jyoti Surana, Pooja Surana, Dhirendra Bhadana, Ashish Gupta among many were part of the initiative.

"LUCKNOW: As Delhi heads towards another peak and is reporting a record of over 6,000 new cases daily, cities in west UP adjoining the capital are also staring at a spike in infection. On Wednesday, Noida reported 339 cases, beating even Lucknow, which has consistently been the district with the highest number of new Covid-19 cases across the state since the past several days. Ghaziabad reported 130 cases on Wednesday, while Meerut reported 175. Together, the three districts contributed 29.21% to the stateâs daily positive cases. If combined with Lucknow, the four districts accounted for 41.78% of the total new cases in the state on Wednesday. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to increase surveillance and testing in these areas to keep control over the rise in cases. âCases in all cities bordering Delhi have been reflecting the trend seen in the capital as there are lakhs of people who live in these cities across the border, but work in Delhi and vice versa. Delhiâs cases have been rising since the past week or 10 days and we can see that getting reflected in Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Meerut. We need to be very careful in these areas,â said an official. He added that the high pollution concentration in the capital had also affected these areas, which could have contributed to an increase in the number of new cases per day. On October 25, total active cases in Gautam Budh Nagar were 1,082 which then gradually rose to 1,261 on November 1 and again went on to touch 1,443 on November 4. Similarly, Ghaziabad moved from 1,142 cases on October 25 to 1,041 on November 1 and now to 1,146. Meerut, meanwhile, went up from 1,351 to 1,431 and then to 1,498 in the same duration. Gautam Budh Nagar with 339 cases and 177 recoveries on Wednesday upset the stateâs Covid recovery data. Officials say the sharp spike in this district is especially worrying. Since November 1, the district has reported 839 positive cases. âThe district administration has been told to strengthen contact tracing and surveillance in this district especially. With Diwali coming up, it is imperative to ensure that the situation does not get out of hand,â the official said. "

"MUMBAI: The steady decline in Covid-19 detections in the state continued for the third day in a row. On Thursday, 7,539 cases were reported in Maharashtra â the fifth day of having less than 10,000 new cases in a day â taking the stateâs tally to 16,25,197. Daily deaths in Maharashtra saw a marginal increase from Wednesday but continued to remain under 200 (198), taking the total toll to 42,831. Mumbai on Thursday reported 1,463 cases, a slight decline from the 1,609 cases reported on Wednesday. The cityâs overall caseload went up to 2,47,332. With the addition of 49 deaths, which took the cityâs overall toll to 9,961, Mumbai is likely to reach the grim milestone of 10,000 Covid deaths on Friday.

"MUMBAI: The Centre has written to the chief secretary expressing serious concern over the decline in Maharashtraâs daily testing numbers and called for immediate steps to reverse this trend. Principal health secretary, Dr Pradeep Vyas, on Saturday asked district collectors, municipal commissioners and CEOs to pull up their socks, saying the state was almost at the bottom of the tests per million ranking in the country. Districts have also been asked to hold their vaccine task force meetings by December 25. In a scathing letter, Dr Vyas said the stateâs daily testing average has been stagnating in the range of 60,000-65,000. Calling it the stateâs weakest point in the fight against Covid-19, he said Maharashtra has fallen much behind the national average of per million testing. âConsidering the size of our states and resources available, it looks very odd,â he wrote. He further added that only nine districts; Mumbai, Akola, Aurangabad, Buldhana, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Nandurbar, Sindhudurg and Washim could achieve more than 50% of their RT-PCR test targets. Of these, only Sindhudurg and Washim could reach 70% of the target. The principal secretary also sought rationalization of Covid facilities in light of declining cases and called for urgent attention to non-Covid services. âIt has been seen that the number of doctors and staffers are 10-15 times the number of admitted Covid patients in some centres,â he wrote, adding steps must be taken to move patients to one place for optimal utilisation of resources. He particularly flagged the need to convert more facilities into non-Covid. During a recent mission to find active TB cases, Dr Vyas said it was found that several Xray facilities were unavailable for non-Covid work and operation theatres were nonfunctional. He said all OTs and labour rooms in rural and sub-district hospitals should be made operational. In Mumbai, scores of midlevel private hospitals across the cityâs 24 wards have reconverted to non-Covid facilities as Covid cases dropped drastically in the past two months. The current bed occupancy for Covid-19 beds has dropped to 26%. Of the 16,437 Covid beds in Mumbai, over 12,200 are lying vacant. Civic officials said many more nursing homes and hospitals have sought permission to convert to non-Covid facility. âWe are getting requests from many to return to non-Covid work and since that is important too, we are granting immediate permissions,â said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMCâs executive health officer. Meanwhile, as part of vaccine preparedness, Dr Vyas has asked district-, block- and corporation-level task force meetings to be held by December 25. He pointed out that in several places such meetings have not been held so far. He has also asked Dr Deepak Mhaisekar, advisor to the chief minister, Dr Subhash Salukhe, advisor to government and officials from the public health department to visit districts and monitor the progress.

"TEHRAN: Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Friday banned Iran from importing of American Pfizer-BioNTech and Britain's Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccines, a reflection of mistrust toward the West. In a televised speech, he said the import of American and British vaccines were âforbidden,â referring to the surging death tolls from the virus in both countries. âI really do not trust them,"" Khamenei said of those nations. ""Sometimes they want to test their vaccines on other countries, adding, âI am not optimistic (about) France,â either. However, Khamenei okayed the import of vaccines from other âsafeâ places, and remains supportive of Iran's efforts toward producing a vaccine. The country began testing its vaccines on humans in December. The product is expected to hit the local market in spring. Hardliners in Iran have longed opposed the US-made vaccines. Iran's Revolutionary Guard in December rejected the use of foreign-made vaccines altogether. Gen. Mohammad Reza Naghdi said the Guard âdoes not recommend the injection of any foreign vaccineâ candidates based on genetic material known as messenger RNA, which carries the instructions for cells to make proteins. Authorities said then that US-based benefactors plan to deploy scores of thousands of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus to Iran. Iran retains routes to vaccines despite sanctions, including through its participation in COVAX. International banks and financial institutions are reluctant to deal with Iran for fear of American penalties. "
"INDORE: Health commissioner on Thursday issued a new algorithm for standard operation procedure for epidemiological surveillance and response to new SARS-CoV-2 strain detected in the United Kingdom. The surveillance has to be done among the person returned from UK in between November 25 to December 23 for next one month, even after they test negative in initial testing. In case of person tested positive for new strain, the health authorities in the state are directed to only discharge a person after testing two negatives within 24 hours after 14 days, directed the health commissioner Sanjay Goel in the order. There are no changes in medical and non-medical intervention for treating such patients under the new SOP. However, in case the case of testing positive for the older strain the existing procedure should be followed. The authorities are also directed for genome sequencing of all the positive cases detected after returning from UK. And, even the person is tested negative, they should be followed for the next 28 days and retested if they develop any symptoms in between and rest the procedures should be followed, noted the commissioner in the order. The order was issued following an instruction to the state government from the union government for surveillance about the new virus. MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, âWe are already following these sets of procedure for one UK returned positive case admitted to the super speciality hospital.â He was tested positive again on the 10 day for the infection amidst the treatment. As he was tested positive, he remained in the hospital. He will be discharged only after testing negative twice in 24 hours, added Dr Dixit. Around 95 persons returned to city from UK were traced and sampled after reports of new strain there. Only 2 of those 95 were tested positive of the COVID-19 infection. There samples for genome sequencing were sent to NCDC for testing for the possible new strains. There reports are awaited. "
"LUCKNOW: In a major relief to thalassemia and haemophilia patients, the UP government has announced that no charges would be taken from them and their attendants for Covid-19 testing. In another decision, the government reduced the cost of Covid-19 testing for cancer patients and those requiring regular dialysis to Rs 300 from existing Rs 1,500. For patients of all other illnesses, the cost of Covid-19 testing was fixed at Rs 600. âThese patient groups need to visit the hospitals frequently for follow-ups and continuity of treatment. Since Covid-19 testing is mandatory, they end up shelling a lot of money. Understanding their problem, the government has come up with the new rates,â said Dr Rajneesh Dube, additional chief secretary, medical education. Once a formal order is issued the decision would apply on medical institutions and colleges like Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, King Georgeâs Medical University, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences and so on. Till now patients had to shell out Rs 1,500 at these centres for Covid-19 testing. The revised rates are 80% less for cancer and dialysis patients and 60% less for all other patients. Officials at the state medical education directorate stated that the order did not cover private pathologies where the government had fixed a rate of Rs 1600 for the same test. Patients expressed happiness over the decision hoping that it was implemented at the earliest. âI need to undergo Covid-19 testing at least 2-3 times a month for my radiotherapy sessions. An 80% saving is a big amount,â said Reeta Singh who has undergone a breast cancer surgery at SGPGI. Officials at the medical institutes said that there was lack of clarity on whether the revised rates would be applicable to attendants too. They hoped that the ambiguity would be cleared once the official order is issued. "

"MUMBAI: Lives may be limping back to normalcy for many as businesses open, offices seek their employeesâ return and restaurants see more footfall. For families who have lost their main breadwinners to coronavirus, though, the struggle is far from over. The virus, since its arrival in March, has claimed 11,000 lives in the city. Six months since Ishrat Shiekh lost her husband Shaukat Ali, a unani practitioner, to Covid-19, she is on the verge of giving up hope of seeing her 16-year-old daughter pursue an ayurveda degree. Left without an income and the support of an extended family, the 38-year-old Ishrat is worried her children may not be able to get quality education. âEverybody tells me to take up a job. Firstly, where are the jobs? And how do I suddenly join the workforce without any training or skill,â asks the mother of three who is also worried about leaving her seven-yearold son and two teenaged daughters without any supervision at their house in Malwani. Ali, who died aged 45, had come to Mumbai nine years ago to build a better life for the family. In his last job, he was posted in the emergency medical service room at Malad railway station. The doctor, she says, struggled to find timely and appropriate care as he ran from one hospital to another before succumbing to the infection on June 8. She says her husbandâs employer had promised to help with money or employment, though nothing has materialised so far. âThe little savings we had have almost run out,â she says. Of Mumbaiâs 11,000 deaths, nearly 15% have been in people between the age group of 20 and 49. Pradip Mali had died aged 25 in Kasturba Hospital on April 18 with no friends or family members around to whisper a final goodbye. The entire Mali family had tested positive and was isolated in a hotel while Pradip and their 55-year-old mother had to be hospitalised. Facing resistance from their neighbours in Khetwadi after they returned from isolation, the family decided to temporarily move to their hometown Sirohi in Rajasthan and returned only in October. âThe grief has not left our side. It has plunged our future into uncertainty,â says Pradipâs brother Pankaj. The brothers had together rented a sprawling commercial space in Badlapur and ran a successful mobile phone store till Covid struck. âThe storeâs monthly rent is Rs 75,000, but we are not making that kind of sales any longer,â says the brother. There is also little clarity on what the future holds for Pradipâs wife and two-year-old son. âShe is free to decide if she wants to stay there or return to Mumbai. Currently, she has chosen to stay back with her parents in Rajasthan,â says Pankaj, adding his motherâs mental health issues have aggravated since the death. âShe is on heavy medication now. Our lives may never be the same again,â he said. The family of Zabir Usmani (51), another alternative medicine practitioner who died in May, said the government must find a way of supporting them. Usmani, who escorted patients in 108 ambulances during the day and ran his own clinic at night, left behind three teenaged children and a wife. âMy in-laws are currently supporting us but how long can people support an entire family,â says his wife Rubina.

"MUMBAI: The city has crossed 11,000 Covid-19 deaths with the addition of a dozen casualties. The grim milestone (11,003) came in 53 days after the 10,000-mark. It was the second slowest thousand for Mumbai (see graphic). An addition of 795 cases on Wednesday, slightly more than the daily detections seen in the previous five days, pushed the overall tally to 2,84,404. Maharashtraâs total caseload has dropped by 10,218 cases due to the removal of duplicate entries and assigning of cases from outside the state to their respective regions. The stateâs overall tally stood at 18,80,893 on Wednesday after 4,304 fresh cases were recorded, a jump of 1,000 from the previous day. Active case totals too fell after the reconciliation exercise. From 71,356 active cases, the stateâs active case tally fell to 61,454. The last time the state had fewer than 70,000 active cases was prior to June. Mumbaiâs active cases too fell from 14,096 to 6,958 due to the data clean-up. Pune now has more than double (17,000) this number while Thane has over 11,000. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said data reconciliation has been done till November 12. âThe difference in number of active cases and recovery within the state in a few districts and in corporation limits is due to the change in residential address of positive cases and recovered persons,â he said. Deaths in the state rose to 95 on Wednesday, up from 70 and 60 on Tuesday and Monday respectively. Of the 95, 57 occurred in the last 48 hours and 17 in the previous week. The remaining 21 were from a period before last week, officials said. The reconciliation, however, pushed up case fatality rates. It went up to 2.58% and 3.86% for Maharashtra and Mumbai respectively from 2.56% and 3.76% on Tuesday. Within MMR, Thane city saw 106 new positive cases on Wednesday, taking the overall tally in the district to 53,723. Three deaths took fatalities to 1,217.

"INDORE: More the level of pollution in air, higher are the chances of getting infected with Covid-19 as rise in level of toxic gases and particulate matters in air promotes increasing rate of virus infection, doctors involved in treating Corona patients in two medical colleges of the district said. Dr Ravi Dosi, HoD respiratory medicine SAIMS said, âPolluted air helps in increasing infection of Coronavirus. So, it will be challenging this year because we are in the middle of a pandemic.â The increase in air pollution will also not spare the cured people or the ones undergoing treatment at hospitals because it could lead to precipitation of bronchitis in them, said Dr Dosi. During Deepavali every year the levels of toxic gases like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and PM 2.5 increase due to firecrackers. So, the people should avoid bursting crackers, added Dr Dosi. Dr Salil Bhargava, HoD respiratory medicine MGM said, âThe people of the district have shown restrain by not burning firecrackers this year during Dussehra. This has to be continued during Deepawali.â âI expect the people will show this marvellous discipline and avoid burning firecrackers. Otherwise, toxic gases can create problems for asthmatic, elderly, COPD and children,â said Dr Bhargava while talking to TOI. "
"AHMEDABAD: If marriages are made in heaven, in this community the price of acquiring that blessing is just Re 1. The Saatso (700) Kadva Patidar Samaj of Visnagar has conceived an initiative to mitigate the effects of the Covid crisis. Under the initiative, couples can marry for a token amount of Re 1 in a public ceremony. The expenses for the party plot, decorations, food, wedding dresses, and gifts are borne by the community organization. âThe pandemic has caused financial troubles for many. People from our community have come forward to help,â said Kirtibhai Patel, the chairman of Saatso Kadva Patidar Samaj Vivekanand Charitable Trust. The influential Patel community is known for big fat weddings costing crores. But due to Covid restrictions, only 100 people â 50 from each side â are allowed to attend weddings. The wedding cost organized by the samaj would be Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. On Saturday, the samaj conducted the first wedding at a Visnagar venue. Deesa Patel of Shahpur village near Visnagar and Akshay Patel of Anandpura village married after shelling out Re 1. The samaj has 7,000 families as members in Vadnagar, Visnagar, Vijapur, Surat, Vadodara, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. The samaj had planned a mass marriage ceremony on December 6. Every couple was to pay Rs 25,000. In all, 30 weddings were scheduled but Covid curbs nixed the programme. Eventually, many community members stepped in to financially help those planning weddings in the time of corona. âSome offered to serve food while others foot the bill for the party plot,â said Kiritbhai Patel. He said that the community was planning to charge Rs 5,000 per couple but a credit society formed by the community decided to bear that expense too. The couples availing the Re 1 scheme cannot hold a post-wedding reception. This is to minimize the risk of infections and to encourage people to save money. "
"BENGALURU: The insurance regulator has now changed norms to permit the renewal, migration and portability of Covid-19 specific standard health insurance policies -- Corona Kavach, Corona Rakshak and Group Corona Kavach -- to normal health policies. In a circular issued on Tuesday, Irdai said insurers have the choice to allow renewal, migration and portability of the Corona policies, which currently can be bought for three and half months, six and half months and nine and half months. Coronavirus outbreak: Live updatesIn the case of Corona Kavach individual policies, insurers can allow migration to other health insurance policies -- but for group covers insurers migration (to individual policy) can happen when a member exits the group cover or the policy ceases. This is to ensure continuous insurance coverage with no waiting period of 15 days, said Irdai. If the policyholder wishes to increase the sum insured at the time of the renewal, there will be waiting period of 15 days for the ""increased sum insured"" and not for the whole policy. "

"BERLIN: Thousands of coronavirus sceptics are set to descend on Berlin on Saturday for a mass protest against pandemic restrictions that was allowed to go ahead after a bitter legal battle. Police said they will turn out in force and strictly monitor compliance with mask-wearing and social distancing, with Berlin police chief Barbara Slowik warning that if the demonstrators do not adhere to virus safety rules, police will clear the area ""very quickly"". ""We will not be able or willing to watch tens of thousands assemble and create infection risks,"" she added. Berlin city authorities had previously decided not to allow the Saturday demonstration to go ahead, fearing that the estimated 22,000 protesters would not keep a distance of 1.5 metres (five feet) apart or comply with face mask requirements. The ban sparked outrage from organisers and their supporters who flooded social media with angry messages vowing to protest anyway, with some even calling for violence. But on the eve of the demo, Berlin's administrative court sided with the demonstrators, saying there was no indication that organisers would ""deliberately ignore"" social distancing rules and endanger public health. A crowd including families with children gathered Saturday morning around Brandenburg Gate, the starting point of the demonstration. ""I'm not an extreme right-wing sympathiser, I'm here to defend our fundamental freedoms,"" said Stefan, a 43-year-old Berlin resident with a shaved head and a T-shirt with the words ""Thinking helps"" written in large print. ""We're here to say: we have to be careful! Coronavirus crisis or not, we must defend our freedoms,"" Christina Holz, a 22-year-old student, told AFP. Around 3,000 police officers, including 1,000 federal police, would be deployed for the demonstration, alongside specialist equipment including water cannon, Slowik said. The rally comes as coronavirus cases continue to rise in Germany, with daily new infection numbers reaching highs not seen since April. At a press conference on Friday, Chancellor Angel Merkel said confronting the virus will become more challenging in the coming autumn and winter months. Merkel and the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states on Thursday introduced tougher coronavirus restrictions to curb the pandemic, including a minimum 50 euro ($59) fine for people caught not wearing face masks where one is compulsory. ""We will have to live with this virus for a long time to come. It is still serious. Please continue to take it seriously,"" Merkel warned. The court decision to allow the protest shines a light on the battle lines being drawn up between those who are content to follow government-mandated protection measures and those who believe that governments shouldn't be able to dictate how people live. At the start of August, a similar ""anti-corona"" march in Berlin took place with 20,000 protesters, a mixture of the hard left and right, anti-vaccination campaigners, conspiracy theorists and self-described ""free thinkers"". Police broke up the protest early after participants repeatedly flouted Covid-19 safety regulations. The far-right welcomed Friday's court ruling allowing the latest demo to go ahead, with Leif-Erik Holm, a lawmaker for the anti-migrant AfD party, calling it ""a victory for freedom"". But several groups intend to stage counter-demonstrations to the main protest. Anne Helm from the left-wing party Die Linke and an MP in Berlin's parliament, said: ""There must be no tolerance towards racists, anti-Semites, right-wing extremists and Nazis. That is why I call on all Berliners to take part in the counter-events."" Meanwhile, the German Hotel and Restaurant Association reported that hotels in the capital recorded noticeably more bookings for the weekend. ""We assume that the rooms were booked in connection with the demonstration,"" Thomas Lengfelder, the association's local leader, told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. Several countries around the world have seen protests against coronavirus restrictions and lockdown measures in recent months. "
"PRAYAGRAJ: The much-awaited festival of Durga Puja formally began in the city on Thursday. However, it remained a low-key affair in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This year, Durga Puja committees of Prayagraj have set up barwaris in accordance with the guidelines issued by the state government and the district administration. Simplicity and basic Puja rituals have replaced the grandeur and huge theme-based pandals that the residents used to witness in the past years. The samitis have not only decreased the size of the pandals but have also limited the number of people who can enter at a time. A range of other measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus has been put in place. The size of the main idol has been reduced to around four feet from the usual six-foot-tall structure. Devotees are allowed to see the pandals only from a safe distance. At the 140-year-old City Barwari, the main idols are placed on the stage, while all the devotees, barring the priest and a few organisers, sit at the other side of the barricade. Similarly, at Bai Ka Bagh Barwari, the devotees are made to sit, at a safe distance from each other, outside the well lit and decorated pandal. Another difference marked this year is the absence of Dhaakis (Dhaak players), who used to arrive in large numbers from West Bengal every year on the invitation of many barwaris of the city and stay here till the conclusion of the Puja. This year, most of Durga Puja samitis are relying on recordings of Dhaak beats which are amplified through the loudspeaker when the rituals are being performed. âWe are fortunate that two of the four Dhaak players we had invited, have managed to arrive in the nick of time. Not all pandals have these Dhaakis this year,â said Tanmay Chaterjee, who is associated with City Barwari. Another highlight of this yearâs Durga Puja is the provision of quarantine wards near the pandals.  âWe have been instructed by the administration that if any visitor shows Covid-like symptoms, they should be immediately shifted to these separate quarantine wards so that other devotees are safe,â said Alok Roy, general secretary of Colonelganj Barwari. Besides, thermal screening and masks have been made compulsory at all the pandals. Unlike previous years, when there used to be an award for the best pandals in the city, this year, the panel from the Bengali community will announce award for the barwari which has strictly followed all the Covid-19 norms.

"PUNE: As many as 5,000 allopaths withdrew their clinical work for 12 hours and another 250 private hospitals temporarily suspended their out-patient departments (OPDs) to support the Indian Medical Associationâs (IMA) nationwide strike in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Friday. Although OPD services were temporarily shut, none of the doctors stopped treating Covid suspected/positive patients and those needing emergency medical care. âThe aim of the strike was to make people aware of the recent unjust notification. It was not directed at causing any inconvenience to anybody,â Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMAâs Hospital Board of India, said. Allopathy doctorsâ organizations, including the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Indian Dental Association (IMA) and others, started protesting ever since the Centre Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) under the Ayush ministry allowed postgraduate (PG) students of ayurveda to perform 58 surgeries/procedures through a gazette notification on November 20. âWe also reached out to people through various social media platforms and educated them about their health rights and how the notification is going to violate those rights and mislead them,â Patil said. The PG ayurveda doctors in Maharashtra reiterated that they had been receiving hands-on training to perform the surgeries during the three-year-long PG curriculum (including a year-long internship) for the last four decades. Surgeons of modern medicine, however, underline that performing surgery is not just a technician's job. âTo diagnose the condition is not enough. Anticipating problems and possible complications is equally important,"" said senior orthopaedic surgeon Nitin Bhagali. Currently, more than 300 dental colleges are there producing 30,000 dentists in India per year. About 1 to 1.5 lakh dentists are unemployed. âAllowing ayurveda postgraduates to do some dentistry work will be disastrous cocktail which will be harmful to patients too,â said Manisha Garud, national secretary, Indian Dental Association (IDA).

"NEW DELHI: The capital recorded 2,463 fresh cases of the novel coronavirus on Wednesday with over 72,000 tests being conducted. The positivity rate dropped to 3.42%, down from 4.23% on Tuesday. These fresh cases came out of 72,079 tests conducted the previous day, which included 32,976 RT-PCR tests. Fifty fatalities were recorded on Wednesday, pushing the toll to 9,813. The active cases tally dropped to 20,546 from 22,310, the previous day. The state health department said the total number of cases climbed to 5,99,575. âThe overall positivity rate on Wednesday is 3.42 per cent. The rate has been less than 5% for the past eight days. The positivity rate for RT-PCT tests is 6.46%. Todayâs death numbers are lowest since November 1,â state health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted. He added that for the first time ever, over 2,500 ICU beds were vacant for Covid-19 patients on Wednesday. Public health specialists said the declining positivity rate signals ebbing of the third wave of the infection in the capital. âIf the positivity rate continues to stay below 5%, we will overcome the pandemic,â a health department official said. Covid cases in the city peaked most recently in November, claiming over 2,600 lives and affecting over 1.8 lakh people in a month. A maximum of 8,593 fresh cases were reported in a single day on November 11. Health experts believe that a significant population in the capital has already been exposed to the coronavirus and, therefore, the likelihood of another spike in fresh cases of Covid-19 is unlikely.

"BENGALURU: Fresh Covid-19 cases in Karnataka fell for the eighth week in a row, raising hopes of the virus being under control even as experts recommended continued caution anticipating a second wave. Analysis of data for 10 weeks â from September 29 and December 7 â shows that barring the October 6-12 week, new cases have been dropping in the 20%-33% range. The December first week cases are a 20-week low. With 9,107 cases from December 1 to 7, daily fresh casesâ average growth rate has been 0.1% this month. At 10,342, cases in the last week of November were the lowest in five months with only the first week of July comparable with 11,573 cases. Dr V Ravi, member, Covid-19 technical advisory panel, said: âThis indicates people have been responsible and we could be approaching herd immunity. However, we cannot be complacent.â Stateâs overall case fatality rate better than national averageAs of December 8, Karnatakaâs overall confirmed cases per million stood at 13,606 compared to 7,304 nationally. The stateâs overall case fatality rate, at 1.3%, is better than the national average. Karnatakaâs recovery rate stands at 96%, with more than 25,000 patients still under treatment. The daily average (of new cases) in December is 1,300 â a first in five months; the same stood at 1,477 in the last week of November. In November, the state government was looking at a slew of restrictions, including curbing New Year celebrations, based on recommendations from the technical committee, which deliberated strategies to tackle the anticipated second wave. One committee member said the dip in fresh cases is a relief because the decline has been consistent. He said the state may have to restrategise its testing to cover more districts that showed low exposure in the previous serological survey. âThe weekly data may indicate we could be approaching herd immunity. But people must continue to wear masks and maintain social distance. The government must continue testing more than a lakh samples daily. We have recommended that districts other than Bengaluru test more,â Ravi said. A clear indication of herd immunity will emerge only after another sero-survey, which may happen in January subject to governmentâs approval, he said. "
"AHMEDABAD: New Yearâs Eve in Gujarat doesnât merely translate to flocking to watering holes. With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic coupled with the night curfew imposed in four major cities of the state, the New Yearâs Eve party scene is expected to be just another day of monotony. While the celebration spirits will be muted for people across the state, a huge loss in business ranging from retail to hospitality and hotels and restaurants to even musicians is expected. For hotels and restaurants, business over these two days alone is usually double of a normal dayâs business in Ahmedabad alone. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurantsâ Association (HRA) â Gujarat, said, âPeople are visiting during lunch hours. However, that is not likely to add to our revenues in a big way as it is a working day. The business has been adversely impacted as nobody would plan a dinner in a rush on New Yearâs Eve.â That apart, retail sales tend to grow at least by 15% in textile and accessories segment, according to industry estimates. However, this year, thanks to a weakened sentiment due to the pandemic as well as the night curfew, the sales and in turn, revenue has taken a big hit. âAfter the second wave of coronavirus infections, footfall reduced at malls once again and the night curfew has further added to its decline. The demand has taken a hit and if we compare against last yearâs business, it has reduced by 70%. Thriving online business has also eaten into our business,â said a retailer in a city-based mall. A number of venues including party plots as well as hotels organize dance parties, live music performances and gala dinners during the Christmas-New Year season. However, with the night curfew and restrictions on gatherings, this year, the entire business is expected to be a dull affair. This has impacted musicians in a big way as usually they have higher earnings during this time of the year. Nicolette Gore, a musician based in Ahmedabad, said, âMany musicians play commercial gigs during this time of the year as it is the peak season when performances take place from time to time. No doubt most of 2020 was lost out in terms of business for musicians. However, some who are really active have also ventured out of Ahmedabad to perform at parties and gatherings.â "

"Lucknow: Against the general notion that coronavirus lockdown had an adverse impact on businesses and savings, the stamp and registration department in Lucknow registered over 150% rise in revenue from property registration â an indication that peopleâs inclination for investment in land remains largely unaffected. Data accessed by TOI reveals that after the coronavirus lockdown, the stamp and registration department registered a significant increase in revenue. In August, it recorded 99% revenue collection against the target of Rs 166.92 crore, while in September, the department earned Rs 164.84 crore which was 96% of the target.

Officials said the stamp department has earned Rs 1099.1 crore revenue till November month. The target for current financial year is Rs 2,178.5 crore. âThe rate at which we are registering properties since August is very surprising to us. Unlike after demonetization, people are heavily investing in land and houses. Rise in revenue collection from registration of properties seems to indicate that the real estate sector is registering significant growth,â said assistant inspector general (stamps), Lucknow, Ram Akbal Singh. Data shows that from April to November this year, 78,561 registrations were done for categories of stamp involving sale, mortgage, gift, settlement, power of attorney and others, while in the same period last year, 99,750 registrations were done. It is to be noted that in the current financial year there was no registry in April and May while June and July registered low registrations due to coronavirus lockdown. âWe have made losses to the tune of nearly Rs 700 crore but if current trend continues, the stamp and registration department will recover the losses in next four months,â said the AIG (stamps).

"NEW DELHI: The government is expecting two vaccines against Covid-19 â Oxford-AstraZenecaâs Covishield and Bharat Biotechâs Covaxin â to be available by January and around four vaccines by the end of April, increasing the prospects of adequate supplies to inoculate some 30 crore priority population by July, an official said. While Covishield, according to a PTI report late on Sunday evening, sought emergency approval, Covaxin is expected to be approved for emergency use by the end of January or early February, if the shots clear scrutiny. The drugs regulator and the government are also examining Pfizerâs application for emergency authorisation and may give the go-ahead but are keen to understand how many shots can be supplied to boost Indiaâs priority vaccination programme. Serum Institute seeks emergency use authorisation for Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield in IndiaApart from these three, Russiaâs Sputnik V is also likely to be rolled out by April. âWe are expecting that by April, there will be at least four vaccines in India. So, there should be enough vaccines available to cover the priority group by June-July,â a senior official told TOI. Pfizer, which has already got emergency use authorisation in the UK, Bahrain and several other countries for its vaccine candidate, has also applied in India. The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration (NEGVAC), headed by Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul, and the subject expert committee (SEC) under the Central Drugs Control Organisation will review the application over the next few days.

"Ludhiana: With a dip in cases of Covid-19 bringing some relief for city residents and administration, the latter has allowed the Dussehra committees to celebrate the festival with certain precautions. Members of these committees here have now started making plans for the same. Most of the Dussehra committees are in favour of performing rituals with a restricted number of members of the committees and then on the day of Dussehra there will be virtual celebrations with telecast of âRavana dahanâ through social media. Dinesh Marwaha of Sri Ramlila Committee, Daresi, said, âWe have been allowed to hold celebrations but have been asked to do everything in a simple manner. So, we will be starting with Ramayan path from October 17, the first Navaratra, and it will continue up to October 26. Meanwhile, we are gearing up for burning the effigy of Ravana on Dussehra, where only executive members of the committee will remain present and for public there will be live telecast of the entire function.â He said they would get more chances to celebrate festivals next year if people would remain healthy. So, this year, they will only perform the rituals which are essential. Raju Thapar of Upkar Nagar Dussehra and Ramlila Committee said, âWe will organise Ramayan path in a simple manner and nobody from public will be allowed to come and gather at the spot. And on the day of Dussehra we will burn the effigy of Ravana and we will pray to God that coronavirus also gets burnt in fire. This disease has damaged everything, so this Dussehra will mark victory of good over evil as well as this deadly disease.â Subhash Chader Gupta, chairman of Dussehra and Ramlila Committee, Aggar Nagar, said, âOn the first Navaratra we will do puja in the temple in the locality and a simple celebration will take place on the beats of a dhol but there will no major celebrations like swings in fair or holding of Ramlila, which we used to do every year.â He said they would get small effigies of Ravana, Meghnath and Kumbhkaran prepared, along with a set of Lanka.

However, on the other hand general secretary of Dusshera and Ramlila Committee, Sarabha Nagar, Anil Bassi said, âAs of now, we have not planned anything, not even âRavana dahanâ on Dussehra. First, we want to see whether celebrations will actually take place. The CM, Amarinder Singh, had earlier announced to open multiplexes and when all arrangements were done, he rolled back the previous orders, so it is difficult to believe whether Dussehra will be allowed or not.â He said they would reach any conclusion in the next few days. No time for Ramlila or Dussehra fair Most of the Dussehra committee organisers claimed that now they have no time left to organise the Ramlila or a fair which they used to do earlier and moreover, it will encourage more people to come to the Dussehra grounds.

"Hyderabad: With the number of Covid-19 cases showing no signs of abating, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), has come to the rescue of policyholders yet again by allowing migration of standard Corona policies to comprehensive health policies as well as porting to new insurers. IRDAI has also allowed policyholders to renew their Corona policies. On migration, the new norms issued on Tuesday state that in case of Corona Kavach individual policies, insurers have the choice to offer migration to any other indemnity-based health insurance product offered by them. In case of Corona Kavach group policies, IRDAI said insurers can provide migration to any other individual indemnity-based health policy when the member insured exits from the group policy or the group policy ceases. On portability of Corona Kavach (individual) policy from one insurer to another, the 15-day waiting period served in the existing Corona Kavach policy will be protected for Covid-19 coverage by the porting-in insurer, the circular said. As per the norms, the Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak policies of any tenure can be renewed for further terms of three-and-half-months, six-and-half-months or nine-and-half-months by the policyholder till March 31, 2021. However, the policies need to be renewed before the expiry of the existing policy. In such cases, an additional waiting period of 15 days will not be imposed, ensuring seamless coverage. The new norms state that during renewal, policy holders can alter the sum insured and in case of an increase in the sum insured, the waiting period will start afresh only for the enhanced portion of the sum insured. Last month, while addressing an industry summit, IRDAI chairman Subhash Chandra Khuntia had said that insurers had till then covered over 60 lakh lives under the Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak policies.

"NEW DELHI: Even as the UK has become the first country to authorise a vaccine against Covid-19, India continues to look at the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot along with some other Indian candidates as its choice against the pandemic. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is not available for India at present and its requirement for ultra-cold temperature â minus 70 degree Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit) â for storage is a serious hurdle as the vaccine will need to be distributed in remote areas and even urban centres lack such facilities. âWhere are the supplies?

"Ahmedabad: The completion of door-to-door survey for people vulnerable to Covid-19 infection â initiated close to a fortnight ago â has resulted in a list of over 1 crore persons who are above 50 years of age. The survey has also identified 2.6 lakh people below 50 years with co-morbidities. Of the total count in Gujarat, 14.6 lakh people above 50 years and 37,260 with co-morbidities are in eight municipal corporation areas, revealed the survey results. âAs we know from our experience of living with the virus for the past nine months, those above 50 years of age and those with co-morbidities are susceptible to Covid-19 viral infection which can also lead to death. Thus, they would be the first in line to receive the Covid vaccination once the drive starts by the state government,â said a senior health department official. The state administration had earlier mentioned that the two-day intensive survey across the state was carried out based on the electoral rolls. Special booths will be set up to vaccinate people based on the electoral rolls of citizens. Those who get vaccinated would also be marked with indelible ink like election process, they added. The health sector workers will be the first in line to get vaccinated, followed by various government arms. The high-level meetings are convened regularly at the top levels to keep an eye on the vaccination process including storage and transport of the vials.

"PATNA: Apart from the constant scare of contracting the Covid-19 virus, people living in containment zones in the state capital claim to be facing hardship due to non-availability of resources, including daily grocery items, as movement is highly restricted in these areas. Many residents living in containment zones even claimed that their neighbourhoods are neither sanitised nor disinfected regularly. âEvery time I made calls to senior officials, I was asked to call somebody else. Besides, there are no restrictions here. Even though, the apartment has been sealed, people are roaming around for unnecessary things. And yet regular services are unavailable,â said North Mandiri resident Renu Devi. Her apartment block was sealed a few days ago after a Covid-19 positive case was reported from her building. The 48-year-old alleged that residents had to get the building sanitized on their own as it wasnât done by officials concerned. Shristy Sonal, another resident of North Mandiri, claimed that people easily cross the sealed area and go to offices, markets and other places. Several residents in other containment zones in the city said that they are facing problems in getting essential commodities such as milk or grocery items. Rehan Ahmed of Muradpur lane said, âThere are nearly eight houses in this area but no shops. Itâs a big hassle for us to arrange ration and everything as home delivery is also banned. As I cannot go outside, I ask my newspaper vendor to bring milk and other things.â He added that the unhygienic condition of the streets is posing threat to people, especially the diabetic patients. âWe are maintaining cleanliness as much as possible but itâs not in our hands to keep the streets clean. Despite cleaning to the authorities, we did not get any response,â Ahmed said. Patna DM Kumar Ravi said only essential commodities shops are allowed to remain opened in the containment zones. âWe are in the unlock phase now and lockdown has been imposed only in containment zones. Prior to the unlock when the entire city was under lockdown, we circulated contact numbers of shops for home delivery services, but continuing it now can increase the chances of spread of the virus,â he said. He added, âWe are, however, arranging delivery facilities in big containment zones like we did in Khajpura.â The DM has also directed officials to ensure proper barricading in containment zones. âBanners will also be put up in the areas to inform people. Besides, medical teams have been asked to stay active and look after contact tracing. Strict directions have also been given to sanitize and disinfect the areas,â he said. As per information shared by the state health department on Wednesday, there are currently 1,056 containment zones in the state. âAltogether 1,272 containment zones have been made in Bihar up-till now, of which 216 have been denotified,â a senior official in state health department said.

"CHANDIGARH: The new normal of living with coronavirus has changed the preferences of house hunters, who now look for affordable, easy to maintain, clean houses that have built-in offices.The difficult months of lockdown that confined the tenants to a common living and working space also gave them the time to explore properties online by way of virtual tour in place of going to the site. Developers spotted this trend of healthy living and created projects for the post-Covid-age buyers. Integrated townships are in demand because of their captive shops of essential items. The government has supported the house hunters by reducing the repo rate and coming out with a credit-linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) for affordability and bringing investment to the real-estate market. Developers have embraced the change by customising their projects. In the post-Covid world, house buyers will look for properties that address their need for health and safety, a house that allows an office-going family to work conveniently from home.Omaxe builders' chief executive officer Mohit Goel said: ""Our future house will have home office, large balconies or personal terrace, built-in sanitisation and air filters, and automation. There is sufficient disposable income in cities for curated products.""The new property investor is attracted to the housing societies with health benefits. They look for a green cover, basement, carbon-monoxide sensor, and charging points for electric cars. Sushma Group executive director Prateek Mittal said: ""People have added sports and fitness activities to their daily lifestyle for the sake of strong immunity, and changed their diet. This has attracted health-conscious communities to house farming, the idea of producing organic food at home. Integrated townships promise them access to necessities within the compound.""GBP Group branding and construction director Raman Gupta reported a demand for ready-to-move-in homes, integrated townships, and built-in home offices. He said: ""House hunters also ask for yoga and meditation rooms, besides safety-and-cleanliness teams."""

"Kolkata: Lalbazar has prepared a comprehensive standard operating procedure (SOP) for cops to deal with the pandemic. Unlike in the past when orders had been restricted only to handling outsiders at police stations and managing the barracks, this 30-page long SOP covers every aspect of policing, including the law and order duties, VIP duty, specific raids, movement with the accused after arrest and handing over of official documents. âWe have prepared the SOP to cover all aspects of practical problems faced by cops. This has been prepared after a wide counselling involving junior officers, doctors and virologists. The document should come in handy for every occasion,â said a joint CP at Lalbazar. Kolkata Police have had over 1,600 Covid cases so far while nine personnel died of Covid-19. Several divisions like North and Southwest (Behala) have made many changes at the police stations like setting up specific cubicles for visitors, anti-spit glass partitions and separate changing room for those coming from outside. Almost every police station has set up temporary barracks to maintain social distancing at the old police barracks. Among the ideas propagated are simple like sanitizing entry and exit gates with bleaching powder, sodium hypochlorite and phenyl. Those at the reception have been asked to stock up extra face masks for guests. The new ideas include not allowing visitors to touch any sliding door (it is to be kept open), removing visitors with cough and fever to safe homes and segregating the parking of police vehicles from the public. The senior officers are coming up with specific short term solutions too. Take the case of north division. After several inspector level officers were infected with Covid and many others fell ill, the division has booked hotels and community centres that would serve as temporary barracks. About 50% of the barracksâ workforce has been asked to move to such temporary accomodations. At Behala, where a few cases have been reported from the barracks, cops have set up a separate quarantine centre at Taratala. "
"AHMEDABAD: The 183 Covid-19 positive case in a matter of fortnight at IIT Madras (IITM) set the alarm bells ringing across the residential educational campuses in India, and Gujarat is no exception. Several premier educational institutes â ranging from IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A) to IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) â are residential in nature due to demand of the course design. While some institutes have waited for the government directives to re-open the campuses, several are up and running with limited capacity. IIM-A Covid-19 dashboard points at 108 positive cases since September 1. Out of the total, 97 have recovered till December 17, mentioned the dashboard. In an email response, IIM-A officials said that the institute has allowed students with genuine reasoning to come to the campus. They added that the students undergo medical examination upon arrival and within a week, undergo rapid antigen test (RAT). âTwo resident medical officers are proactively helping the community members... We have created two classrooms with oxygen cylinders and other accessories to help any community member needing such help,â mentioned the response. While information or status of the students could not be obtained from IIT-Gn and PDPU when the article went to the print, the National Institute of Design (NID) registrar Rekha Nair mentioned in email response that NID has not allowed students to return to the campus yet. âAppropriate guidelines (for re-opening) are being worked out based on various academic requirements and advisories by the state and central government,â mentioned the response. Sunjay Chandwani, head (estate and administration) at MICA, said that the institute opened the campus in phased manner since October. âA total of 86 students are currently on campus. They have been allowed after their and their parentsâ undertaking. We allowed only those students with genuine reasons and thus have set specific parameters for the same,â said the response. "

"KOLKATA: This year, bringing idols to pandals will be a âtime-bound affairâ because of the pandemic. There will be no procession and no night-long wait on the road to take idols to pandals from artisansâ studios. Rather, puja organizers will be allotted specific time slots and not more than three to six people per puja committee will be allowed entry in Kumartuli simultaneously. Besides, several organizers may be forced to bring the idols during the day once the process begins on October 17. In a meeting attended by Jorabagan traffic guard and Shyampukur police, the artisans were told to allot a specific time slot to each puja committee for collection of idols. âThis is to ensure that there is no crowding in the area. We will set up one way and the restrictions will have to be followed in letter and spirit. This year, we have increased parking areas so that each truck can stand by maintaining social distancing. We will be coordinating with the artisans to ensure physical distancing. Those organizers not wearing masks will be asked to return,â said an officer from Jorabagan traffic guard. Ranjit Sarkar, joint secretary of Kumartuli Pottery Cultural Association, said, âEveryone must enter Kumartuli Patua para through the two sanitizing channels set up. We have already tested them and they would become operational from October 16. We have set up Whatsapp groups with organizers and assigned them timings,â said Sarkar, adding that these steps were necessary to ensure safety for both idol makers and organizers before the festival. Idol makers like Sarkar or Bhaskar Pal said they are not expecting too much trouble due to the restrictions. âThe fun may be less. But we have to deliver around 3,000 idols this time, instead of 3,800-4,000 each year. Most idols are smaller and Ekchala this year due to budgetary constraints. I have really forgotten when we had made so many Ekchala idols last. This means that a much lesser number of labourers will be required to pick up the idols. The only glitch is that given the time slots, we might have to ask some organizers to come in the morning,â said an officer. Police said they would have wanted labourers, mostly from South 24 Parganas, to get tested for Covid. âBut this might not be possible due to the time frame. But anyone not following the rules will be debarred from work,â said the officer. âIt is usually an elaborate affair to bring Maa here and at least 60 of us are in attendance. This year, we are not even getting willing volunteers,â said the puja organizer of a housing in Behala. The Covid situation, said Sarkar, has also forced them to stop people from coming and taking photographs. "

"NEW DELHI: India will consider clinical trial data for the two full-dose Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate which the firm says has an efficacy of 62% and not the âhalf plus fullâ dose regime which is claimed to be up to 90% effective but has attracted criticism for dosing errors. The Indian governmentâs position that it will consider the two full shot option comes in the wake of red flags raised by vaccine experts about the âpositiveââ interim data, in the light of AstraZenecaâs admission that there was an âinadvertent dosing errorââ during the global clinical trials. AstraZeneca said the half dose option was a case of serendipidity but was persisted with as it was found to deliver a better results than the two full-shot vaccine. The cut-off for vaccine effectiveness for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal regulator, is at 50%. AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine safe, Indian trials progressing smoothly: Serum InstituteLooking to steer clear of the controversy, Indian officials said protocols approved for testing in India are for the two full-shot option and a vaccine with a 62% efficacy, once it clears regulatory scrutiny, is good enough for approval and use. In the immediate context, this might be adequate for emergency use if found scientifically satisfactory. A Serum Institute of India official said Indian trials are proceeding smoothly. Questions over the data had an immediate resonance as the shot is seen as a good option for India given likely early availability, price and use. âLet us wait for the regulators to examine the data. Any call should be scientifically vetted,â said Dr V K Paul, head of the national expert group for vaccine administration. He, however, said it was unscientific for vaccine manufacturers to put confidential data in public domain. âSuch data are meant for consideration of data safety and monitoring board and is highly confidential. Such data are not meant for public debate as it can create perceptions that may or may not be true,â he added. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesAn SII official, reacting to the reports, said, âWe must be patient and not panic. The Indian trials are running smoothly with strict adherence to all the necessary processes and protocols. So far, there are no concerns. However, we are going through the data that is available and will make further statement, if needed.ââ Commenting on AstraZenecaâs preliminary data, he added âvaried age groups with different dosage forms will result in slight variations and efficacyâ. On Monday, AstraZeneca announced that the average efficacy of the two regimes works out to be 70%. While the race to be out with a vaccine could be seeing pharma companies making claims about their vaccines, Indian officials said the protocol approved for AstraZeneca for India does not mention administration of a half dose. The drug regulator may consider emergency use authorisation for the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) â a major manufacturing partner â if AstraZeneca secures approval from the UKâs regulator for two full doses and submits scientifically validated data to the Indian agencies. A Bloomberg report said the firm was planning a new trial that would instead of adding an arm to an ongoing US trial, evaluate a lower dosage that performed better than a full amount in Astraâs studies. There were reports of this dosage doing better among younger recipients. Delhi's 1st vaccine storage at Rajiv Gandhi hospitalExperts advised a cautious approach. âIt would be wise for Serum Institute to focus on the Indian clinical trials and ensure that study is done properly and transparently given the red flags. We need to both understand efficacy and safety better for the vaccine candidate given the two safety incidents, and the seemingly cherry-picking of data for the recent press release,â said Dr Anant Bhan, researcher and former president International Association of Bioethics. âWe have approved a clinical trial protocol only with two full doses. Besides, we will give approval after considering global efficacy data along with the data generated from immunogenicity studies that are being conducted by Serum Institute in India and for the latter, they are using only two full doses. So, there is no question of considering data for one half dose and one full dose, unless the company makes a fresh application with a new protocol for the same,â a senior official told TOI. âThe AstraZeneca faux pas has put a spoke in the Serum Instituteâs wheel. In the face of daunting odds, it would have to prove that the vaccine it is planning to mass-produce for AstraZeneca is indeed as efficacious and safe as it was perceived to be. Given that several competitors are breathing down its neck, it faces an unenviable task of winning the public confidence,â' said SP Kalantri, professor medicine, MGIMS, Sevagram. âEvaluating dosing and intervals is a key part of vaccine development, should not be by accident,ââ said Dr Gagandeep Kang of CMC Vellore. Many global researchers and public health experts questioned the integrity of the results generated though some still backed it by saying none of the companies have submitted data to any regulator. "
"Ahmedabad: A famous ubiquitous slogan against the coronavirus advises people to fight corona, but not discriminate against its patients. A railways employee from the city implemented this on Thursday, as he celebrated his birthday amongst his colleagues in the Covid-19 ward of a private hospital in Satellite. An employee of the Ahmedabad division of Western Railway, Sanjay Suryabali, celebrated his 45th birthday with five railways colleagues. It was an unusual party, as the birthday boy was in a PPE suit. Suryabali met his colleagues, inquired about their health and they wished him a happy birthday. They then cut a cake in the hospital along with doctors, nurses and other medical workers. âMany of my friends and relatives advised me not to go to the Covid-19 ward saying I would get the infection. I did not heed them, as I wanted to the break the stigma associated with the virus,â said Suryabali, the divisional organising secretary of the Western Railways Employees Union (WREU). Suryabali said that he has been working among Covid patients, mainly from the railways, for three months, so he did not take a break on his birthday as well. âWe have lost 14 persons from the railway family to corona and 80 persons have been infected so far. There was a dire need to stand with them in such a trying time and I did it,â he said. One patient, whom Suryabali met on his birthday, expressed his gratitude and said he was like a family member. âOur family may forget about attending to us but not Sanjay,â he said. A railway employee and general secretary of WREU, Misbah-ul Hasan, said that no one would ever think of celebrating his birthday in the way Suryabali did. âWe proud of him as he did a service to humanity,â he said.

"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) had decide to reduce the syllabus by 30% for Classes IX to XII due to the Covid-19 crisis. The decision was taken after the education minister held several rounds of discussions with experts and academicians. On July 8, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced a similar move where it reduced its curriculum by 30%. After this, a committee was constituted by the Gujarat board.Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said the Class X and XII board exams that are conducted in March each year are will likely be held in May next year, due to Covid-19 crisis. The exams for Classes IX and XI will be held in June 2021, the minister said on Monday.Schools have been closed for more than six months now due to restrictions in the state. While online education is being carried out by several schools, the ministry has been receiving complaints about students not being able to study properly in these classes. The Gujarat board decided to make a similar move to the CBSEâs and reduce the syllabus, said sources. Four meeting were held by a newly formed committee, according to sources. At a meeting on September 29, attended by Chudasama and education experts, this decision was arrived at, said sources.In the examination, questions will not be asked from chapters that have been excluded from the syllabus. Chapters that are important for competitive exams will not be excluded, sources added. The syllabus will be revised only for the academic year 2020-21, sources said. "
"BHOPAL: Chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, said on Tuesday that all possible efforts should be made to control the spread of Coronavirus infection but at the same time, it must be ensured that the economic activities are not allowed to suffer at any cost. There should be no binding of time for marriage ceremonies or transportation of goods. The number of guests in a function can be restricted and in areas, where there are more Coronavirus cases, small ""containment zones"" can be created. Crisis management groups of the districts can take a call on this according to local circumstances. He said mandatory wearing of masks must be ensured and if violators should be fined. The social distancing norm should also be followed and a public awareness campaign should be undertaken for the purpose. Chouhan was holding a Coronavirus review meeting through video conferencing from Bandhavgarh in Umaria district. In the district-wise review of the Coronavirus situation, it was found that a maximum of 565 infected persons have been found in Indore on Tuesday and Bhopal is on the second position with 324 new patients. The positivity rate in Bhopal during the past one week has been 12 % and 10 % in Indore. Chouhan asked officials to pay special attention to contain the spread of infection in these two districts. He said if required small ""containment zones"" can be created there. Positivity rate should not be allowed to go beyond 5 % in any circumstances, he said. He said maximum cases of infection in Indore are being found in Kolar area. He said areas like this should have ""containment zones"". In addition to Bhopal and Indore, positivity rate was found higher in Gwalior, Ratlam, Vidisha, Shivpuri, Ashok Nagar, Datia and Anuppur and they should also get special care, the chief minister said.

"NEW DELHI: The three municipal corporations have once again red-flagged alleged discrepancies between the official Covid death count and the number of funerals carried out in Covid-designated crematoria and burial grounds of the city. The civic bodies claimed on Tuesday that more than 10,318 Covid-protocol funerals have been carried out till November 23 while the official death count till Monday was 8,512. The north corporation claimed to have carried out 4,521 funerals, east corporation 1,512 and south corporation 4,285. AAP: Death of people from outside Delhi counted in their statesâ tallyResponding to these claims, Aam Aadmi Party said that the civic bodies had earlier failed to provide any proof to back their claims. A statement issued by the party also pointed out that the city was receiving a large number of patients from other states and their deaths are counted in the tally of their own states. There was no response from the state government. The Delhi government had in April constituted a threemember death audit committee, headed by a former director general of health services, and all hospitals had been directed to report all such deaths to the committee along with a copy of the case sheet. This committee of experts goes through the patientâs medical case sheets, other relevant information and death summary to decide if the Covid-19 viral infection was the primary cause of death â and not other terminal co-morbid conditions, like cancer â before adding it to the daily bulletin. The BJP-led corporations have been alleging that the committee is used to manipulate the daily count by keeping cases pending. The mayors had earlier flagged the mismatch on June 11 when they had claimed that the Covid funeral count of 2,098 was more than double the official death count of 984. AAP had then pointed out that Delhi high court had declared that âthe death audit committee is working in an appropriate manner and that the work of the committee cannot be questionedâ. Several additions were, however, made during the month of June citing old backlog data, which was not reported by the hospitals. The highest number of daily additions was made on June 16 when 437 cases were added. The government had also issued showcause notices to AIIMS, LNJP Hospital, RML Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital, asking them to explain the reasons for the delay in reporting cases of death in June. In the current round of controversy, north corporation mayor Jaiprakash said on Tuesday that last rites of 4,521 bodies of Covid positive and suspected cases have been performed in their facilities between March and November 23. âThe overall number of Covid deaths in the city has gone beyond 10,000. We donât want to play politics on such matters but the Delhi government should not be hiding the true picture from the public. There is no point in adding the death counts after several weeks and months and people should be aware of the real-time situation in their city,â he added. Of these Covid-protocol funerals, 2,636 were carried out in the City SP zone, 496 in the Karol Bagh zone, 640 in the Keshavpuram zone and 749 in the Rohini zone. A statement said that out of the 4,521 bodies received between May 31 and November 23, there were 578 cases of suspected Covid deaths. These are cases in which the test report may be awaited or who showed Covid-like symptoms and could eventually be diagnosed as Covid cases. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said the âreal death figures are much higher and these are proven cases with medical documentsâ. According to a corporation report, 1512 Covid-protocol funerals had been carried out at its Covid-designated facilities at Karkardooma, Ghazipur, Shastri Park, Mulla Colony and Seemapuri. A senior official said that out of these 1512, till Monday, 843 funerals were held in the Shahdra South zone, 669 in the Shahdra North zone. EDMC saw 1,173 Covid confirmed funeral cases and 339 Covid suspect cases. In the jurisdiction of the south corporation, 2197 funerals were held at the crematorium in Punjabi Bagh, 1,139 at Lodhi Road, 328 at Hastsal, 328 at Sector 24 of Dwarka, 292 at Ferozshah Kotla and one at Sarai Kale Khan. The total figure included 139 suspected Covid cases. South corporation mayor Anamika Singh alleged that the government wanted to show lower fatalities. Mayors playing politics, says AAPAn AAP spokesperson said it was unfortunate that mayors were playing politics by making unsubstantiated claims on death count. âThey had made such claims earlier too... but they couldnât submit any details,â he said. âBesides, thousands of patients from other states come to Delhi for receiving critical care. In case of their death, they are cremated in Delhi but their number gets added to the death count of respective states,â he added. "
"In what could be an early sign that Delhiâs third Covid wave is now abating, the capital reported a drop in fresh cases last week, reversing a five-week trend of rising infections. Delhi recorded 44,458 cases during the week (November 15-22), still the highest in the country for the third week running, but down from 46,876 in the previous week. While the dip brings some cheer to the capital, which has seen weekly cases rise steadily since October 4-11, it remains to be seen whether the trend holds this week, when the impact of festivals (Diwali and Bhai Dooj) will begin to be felt. Covid-related deaths, however, rose sharply in the capital with 777 fatalities last week, up from 625 in the previous seven days. With this, Delhi posted the highest deaths in the country last week, a first for the city. Kerala logged the second highest number of cases (37,697) last week, but the state's tally continued to fall for the sixth week running. Maharashtra, on the other hand, recorded a rise in cases, breaking a trend of declining numbers that had held for at least seven weeks. The state added 32,966 cases, the third highest in the country in the November 15-22 week, up from 27,384 recorded in the previous week. The state, however, continued to report a steady drop in fatalities. Maharashtra recorded 649 deaths in the week, a decrease from 734 in the previous week and 1,216 in the week before. In percentage terms, among big states, Madhya Pradesh recorded the sharpest rise in cases between last week and the week before, with a 39% jump in infections. Cases increased from 6,568 in the previous week (November 8-15) to 9,117 last week. Chhattisgarh showed a 34% rise in cases, followed by Rajasthan (25%), Maharashtra (20.4%), and Gujarat (19.6%). Among smaller states/UTs, Nagaland registered a 117% rise in cases, followed by Meghalaya (46%), Chandigarh (36%) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (21%). Andhra Pradesh recorded the steepest fall in cases between the two weeks at -26%, followed closely by Odisha (-25%), Jharkhand (-23%), Karnataka (-23%) and Tamil Nadu (-18%). Meanwhile, 37,566 fresh cases were recorded in the country on Monday, the highest count on a Monday in five weeks, as per TOIâs data based on numbers from state governments. Cases typically dip sharply on Mondays due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend. Last Monday, two days after Diwali, just 28,574 new infections were recorded. The dayâs death toll dipped to 481 despite Delhi reporting 121 fatalities, mainly thanks to a major dip in deaths in Maharashtra. The state reported 30 deaths in the past 24 hours, its lowest single-day toll in 205 days. "
"Prayagraj: The ancient Indian practise of yoga has proved beneficial for a large number of residents across the city as it has helped them to defeat the coronavirus disease. A 45-year-old resident who had tested positive for the coronavirus infection has completely recovered from the disease in just one week with the help of yoga. While it takes at least two weeks for an infected person to recover and turn negative, there are over 35 residents who have successfully made fast recovery as they included yoga in their daily routine. With a total of 178 cases, Prayagraj district has a good recovery rate as 131 have been discharged after recovering from the disease. Nodal Officer and Additional chief medical officer, Rishi Sahai told TOI that patients undergoing treatment for coronavirus infection are now opting for yoga for speedy recovery. We have been holding Yoga sessions daily for patients at Covid level one hospital for speedy recovery. The recent case of utilising the benefits of the techniques of yoga is of a 55-year-old woman who managed to defeat corona within a week. She also made a video where she credited yoga for her quick recovery. The video has gone viral on social media. âInterestingly, the viral video has encouraged more patients to include yoga in their daily routine for a speedy recovery,â said Dr. Sahai. âAnulom vilom and paranayam have helped me to fight against the disease. Many patients are taking the help of yoga and meditation to defeat the infection. One should have a positive mindset as it helps one to build a stronger immunity,â said the 45-year-old man who defeated the virus within a week. âAfter being tested positive for coronovirus infection in the month of May, I did not lose hope and started practicing yoga, meditation and some asans for speedy recovery. Other patients also learnt the same practises and they too managed to recover quickly,â he added. Dr. Sahai, meanwhile, said patients undergoing coronavirus treatment at Covid Level one hospital, claimed that patients are keen to adopt yoga and meditation in morning hours. While some are practising yoga for 30 minutes, others are practising it for more than 45 minutes. "

"SURAT: When these 30 school students of six different schools started learning coding during lockdown they did not know that by the end of the first phase of Covid-19 they will end up developing websites and applications that can assist corona warriors to fight the pandemic better. The students have developed Covid patient tracking app, a web platform for hospital management and online medical shop among many other projects. The three and a half month coding course was designed by academicians and IT professionals to spend their lockdown period more productively. The focus was also to help students learn during the period when they are locked inside their homes. The project was offered free of cost to school students of Sharda Vidhya Mandir, Country Side, Bhulka Vihar, Sanskar Bharti, Deep Darshan and Madhavbaug. âWith a plan to make coding a fun activity and making students learn it from the basics we planned the course. I and a few of my computer expert friends were working from home during lockdown hence we planned to utilise the time by sharing knowledge,â said Jayesh Chaudhari, a graduate from IIIT Allahabad. The course was offered to students from Class VII to IX. âIn the new education policy, the teaching of coding is included. It was not pre-planned but while pondering over some ideas we decided to run the course on a trial basis for free,â said Sanjay Desai, founder of the Country Side School. Learning web development 12-year-old Himanshi Dayaramani has developed a website that provides Covid-19 related news and information on one platform sourced from different locations. âSince there is a lot of information and news available about Covid I planned to create a single platform where a chatbot can assist individuals to gather the information,â said Himanshi, a student of Class VII. âMy father runs a medical shop and during Covid time it is a challenging job. Keeping the idea of social distancing, lockdown and facilitating needy patients I developed the medical shop,â said 13-year-old Class VII student, Dhrovya Vithalani, who developed an online medical shop in just one weekâs time.

"FRANKFURT: Moderna will charge governments between $25 and $37 per dose of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, depending on the amount ordered, Chief Executive Stephane Bancel told German weekly Welt am Sonntag (WamS). ""Our vaccine therefore costs about the same as a flu shot, which is between $10 and $50,"" he was quoted as saying. On Monday, an EU official involved in the talks said the European Commission wanted to reach a deal with Moderna for the supply of millions of doses of its vaccine candidate for a price below $25 per dose. ""Nothing is signed yet, but we're close to a deal with the EU Commission. We want to deliver to Europe and are in constructive talks,"" Bancel told WamS, adding it was just a ""matter of days"" until a contract would be ready. Moderna has said its experimental vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19, based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second developer to report results that far exceeded expectations after Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. The EU has been in talks with Moderna for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine at least since July. "

The ministers would distribute masks and exhort the people to maintain social distancing and avoid gathering to prevent the spread of the virus. Chief minister held a video conference with divisional commissioners, district collectors and district police superintendents said they had worked hard in the last six months to control the spread of virus. But he said considering the spike in virus cases after unlocking, there is need for intensifying the campaign against Corona with the cooperation of the people. He said the peopleâs movement against Corona is non- political programme. He asked the officials ensure the participation of all political leaders of all parties, social activists and NGOs in the campaign. He said it is campaign to save the lives and livelihood of the people asked the employees of all departments to make it a peoplesâ movement. The chief minister also held consultation with the political leaders.

"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded 118 Covid-19 deaths on Friday, the second highest single-day fatality recorded in the city till date. The highest, 131, was recorded on Wednesday. In the last nine days, data shared by the government shows 931 people have succumbed to the disease in Delhi, averaging 103 deaths per day even as the number of cases seem to be stabilising. On Friday, Delhi recorded 6,608 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total tally to over 5.17 lakh while the death toll has reached 8,159. According to the Delhi health bulletin, 62,425 tests were conducted in the national capital in the last 24 hours; 23,507 tests were done using RT-PCR/CBNAAT/TrueNat and 38,918 tests were done using Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits. The positivity rate â the number of positive cases from those tested â was recorded at 10.59%, which is the lowest this month. On November 14 and 15, 14.78% and 15.33% of the samples tested for Covid-19 came positive, triggering fear of high rates of transmission of the infection. The reduction in new cases has, however, had little impact on the rush for beds in hospitals. Most hospitals offering Covid-19 treatment have ICU beds full. âWe have increased our ICU capacity. Despite that, there arenât any vacant beds,â said a senior doctor at AIIMS Trauma Centre. Guru Teg Bahadur, Apollo, Max (Shalimar Bagh and Patparganj both) and Akash healthcare, too, didnât have any ICU bed available, with or without ventilator support. According to the Delhi Corona App, which provides real time updates on availability of hospitals beds, 91% ICU beds with ventilator support and 85% of ICU beds without ventilator support are occupied. âWe are getting many requests for ICU beds. But there are none available,â said a senior doctor at Apollo hospital. Delhi government and the Centre are both actively working to add more ICU beds. To meet the increased demand for manpower, the state government has also allowed hospitals to rope in MBBS students, interns and dentists to assist the duty doctors. Critical care experts say death rate due to Covid-19 has gone up in the current peak, also referred to as the third wave, as compared to the peaks witnessed in June and September. âThis time around, we are seeing more seriously ill patients. Covid pneumonia is the most common complication seen in patients suffering from severe symptoms of the infection,â said a doctor. She added that people rush to hospital late which leads to delay in medical intervention. Unavailability of ICU beds is a key cause, the doctor said. Death rate is very high among persons suffering from diabetes and obesity both, said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary medicine and critical at Apollo hospital said. "
"Kolkata: The state has recommended a daily protein-rich diet for all Covid patients in government hospitals. Egg, fish or chicken, dal and seasonal vegetables have been introduced in the revised food chart for Covid patients. Apart from the quality, the state health department has also revised the quantity. Now, Covid patients admitted to government facilities will be served diet rich in protein and carbohydrates, which will not only improve the immunity but also provide energy to fight the virus better. In a recent order, the health department has revised that rate for cooked meal provided to Covid patients in order to enhance the quality of food served to them. Earlier, they were served the same menu that is being given to general patients. âThe rate for a dayâs meal for each patient earlier was Rs 56. Now the rate has been scaled up by almost three times to Rs 150 per day per patient,â said a source in the health department. Patients will be served meals three times a day and it will comprise bread, boiled egg, banana and milk for breakfast; rice, dal, vegetables, fish/chicken and curd for lunch and rice/roti, dal, vegetables and chicken/fish for dinner. The specific quantity has been communicated to all hospitals. âCurd, banana and milk have been added and the frequency of fish and chicken have been increased. We have also been asked to serve fine rice,â said a vendor of a state-run hospital, that has been made a Covid hospital. This packaged food will be served to all indoor patients in Covid hospitals. Doctors and dieticians said that though all individuals need a balanced diet, those infected by Covid-19 requires it even more. âA proper balanced diet enhances the immunity. Therefore, a balanced and nutrient-rich platter is very important for a Covid patient,â said internal medicine specialist Arindam Biswas. âIt is a good initiative. We have already started serving this menu to our patients,â said Nandan Banerjee, superintend of Ayush Hopsital in Midnapore, which is serving as a level 1 Covid hospital. "
"PUNE: Public health experts have said the Centre should ideally test the countryâs capacity to vaccinate adults before deploying an approved Covid-19 vaccine. Dr Gagandeep Kang â infectious diseases expert at Christian Medical College, Vellore, and prominent vaccine expert â said authorities could have pilots of a mass vaccination programme by giving health workers the flu shot, just to âsee how the system worksâ. Dr Kang said, âWe have never had an adult immunisation programme in the country. The government will depend on the existing immunisation network, which is yet to achieve 100% coverage. Countries such as Bhutan are offering influenza shots to healthcare workers before the actual rollout of the Covid vaccine.â She added that many nations have also deployed the influenza vaccine to prevent a double burden of the flu and Covid in their communities. Dr Kang said, âThese pilots can help us determine how well systems are working. A test run has the added benefit of being an intervention for national policy. It would also help if we could pilot an impact assessment, which will give fresh data.â The expert added that pregnant women and new mothers â often left out of vaccine trials â will need to be monitored during mass vaccination. She said, âThere is some emerging evidence that Covid may be associated with pre-term birth. If that or other poor outcomes of pregnancy are associated with infection, we need to be thinking about how early we can have vaccines for pregnant women. Usually inactivated and subunit vaccines are considered safe for pregnant women, but we do not know about how the new vaccine platforms will be tested in pregnant women.â She said this group is key during an adult immunization campaign because one does not usually ask women if they are pregnant or test for it. Even in the first phase of vaccination, most frontline health staff are women of reproductive age and some may be pregnant without knowing it. âWhat are our plans for these individuals?â Dr Kang said.

"LUCKNOW: As preparations for the Covid-19 vaccination drive continue on war footing in the city, sources in the health department said that medical staff of Covid hospitals will be among the 40,000 frontline workers who will receive the vaccine shots in the first round. The vaccine is expected to arrive in the first or second week of January, said sources. Times ViewThe news of the vaccine has come as a relief, but it does not mean that people should drop their guard. The initial phases of vaccination to frontline workers followed by the elderly and vulnerable will definitely help in breaking the chain and reducing number of casualties, but it will take a few more months for covering a substantial population required to bring the pandemic completely under control. Till then, strict adherence to safety protocols is the best and only option.According to the health departmentâs plan, staff of Covid-19 L3 hospitals will be first among frontline workers to get the shots followed by those in L2 and L1 Covid hospitals. The staff of non-Covid hospitals will receive doses thereafter. Chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, âThe city has 40,000 health workers as per our database. All will be vaccinated. We will prioritise administering the vaccine in the bigger Covid-19 facilities first, followed by smaller units, and then non-Covid-19 hospitals so that the maximum number of vulnerable groups can be covered in a quick span of time.â A meeting has been called on Tuesday in which health department officials from the Centre, state and district will take part to decide the vaccine distribution strategy. A 4,800-sq ft storage unit with four ice-lined refrigerators (ILR), each with 225-litre capacity to maintain a cold chain, has already been made at a healthcare centre in Aishbagh locality of the state capital. The training of vaccinators has also started. ANMs, MBBS interns, staff nurses and pharmacists, both from government and private sector, are being trained as vaccinators. âThese health professionals already know how to administer vaccine. Only precautions which must be taken for Covid vaccination will be taught to them,â said in-charge of routine immunisation Dr MK Singh. âAll persons who will get vaccinated will be registered on the Covid-19 control portal. Database for the purpose has been already prepared,â Dr Singh added. "
"Ahmedabad: While the population above 50 years is considered to be highly susceptible to Covid-19 infection due to age-related factors and existence of co-morbidities, the old age homes â having a large number of senior citizens â fared much better. A study carried out by researchers from Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar (IIPH-G) across three western states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, covering 1,573 residents in 44 old age homes revealed that these homes had 146 positive cases and four deaths, giving cases rate of 9.3% and mortality rate of 2.7%. To put the figures in perspective, about 59% of the deaths in Covid pandemic in Gujarat are from patients above 60 years, whereas the age group of 50 years and above account for 60% of the active cases. Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director of IIPH-G said that the starting point for the study was the high mortality in the pandemic at the old age homes in the western countries. âWhen during our pilot study we found a completely reverse trend, we expanded it and started collecting data,â he said. He said that some of the factors which could be responsible for the phenomenon include de-congesting the old age homes, putting in place stringent restrictions and genetic factors. âSeveral of the home administrators told us that they sent the residents back home in cases when it was a possibility. About 26% of the residents under the study were sent home cumulatively. Even those who lived on the campuses were kept under isolation to reduce chances of infection,â said Prof Mavalankar. The paper titled âLow COVID-19 mortality in old age homes in western India: an empirical studyâ by Prof Mavalankar, Jallavi Panchamia, assistant professor, and Bhavya Bhagat, Vishakha Bharati and Anushree Joshi from IIPH-G, also pointed out that all the care homes were equipped with thermometers, 95% had sphygmomanometer (to check blood pressure), 70% had pulse oxymeters, but only 5% had oxygen cylinder facilities. All the homes had regular visits of doctors and 80% had isolation facility. Dr Prasoon Chatterjee, associate professor (geriatric medicine) of AIIMS Delhi, said that Indian care homes also made it a rule for the caregivers to be on the campus and also laid stringent rules about the visitors, some of the factors which worked in favour of the residents.

"Ahmedabad: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Ahmedabad bench on Tuesday decided to shut its office and courtrooms for the next two days after one staff member tested positive for Covid-19. In a notice, the tribunal said that matters to be taken up on September 30 and October 1, will be listed for hearing in due course. Last month, the Gujarat high court ordered NCLT to draw up a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the purpose of conducting hearings. This happened after a litigating firm questioned the mode of virtual hearings at the NCLT. Earlier, the high court twice shut itself and suspended all judicial functioning for a few days after some of its staff members at the Sola campus tested positive for Covid-19. The last shut down was two weeks ago, when employees were tested after the HC decided to open a few courtrooms for physical hearings. Following the detection of Covid-19 cases on its campus, the HC postponed its plan to open courtrooms and continued virtual hearings. "
"KOLKATA: Supply of favipiravir â the drug that the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) identified for repurposing for Covid-19 patients â is likely to increase substantially when the first consignment from a new manufacturer reaches Kolkata in next 10 days. The price of the medicine also dropped significantly on Saturday, making it more affordable for patients. Pharmacists across the city have been facing a shortage of favipiravir, which is believed to be effective on patients with mild symptoms, since it was identified for repurposing by the CSIR. In April, CSIR found favipiravir as one of the âmost promising drugsâ. Developed by a Japanese company, the drug was so far being sold by a single entity. âIt took some time for the doctors to go through the details and start prescribing it. There has been a shortage since then,â said Somnath Ghosh, director of Metro Pharma. Ghosh, who is a distributor of favipiravir in Kolkata, said each day he needs 50 strips and the demand is always surpassing the supply. Unlike other repurposed drugs for Covid-19 â remdesivir and tocilizumab â favipiravir is sold through normal retail channel. âA patient has to take nearly 100 tablets following doctorâs prescription. This created a huge demand while supply was not adequate,â said Gautam Jatia, CEO of Frank Ross Pharmacy. Moreover, the initial cost of the course of medicine was more than Rs 10,000. Gradually, the price came down from Rs 3,500 a strip to Rs 2,210 a strip, but the supply side did not improve. âIt is likely to improve after another company, which has started manufacturing, will send its first consignment in next 10 days,â said Sajal Ganguly, secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association. âAnother Hyderabadbased company, which got a nod from the Drugs Controller General of India, has started manufacturing,â Ganguly added. Doctors, however, are split on their opinion on favipiravirâs efficacy. âThere is no scientific evidence that proves favipiravir works for Covid-19 patients. The health ministry in Japan has found it to be not as effective in severe patients. So, its efficacy still needs to be assessed,â said Sumit Sengupta, consultant respiratory physician with AMRI Hospital. "
"MUMBAI: The state as well as the city witnessed a considerable jump in fresh detections of Covid-19 cases over 24 hours. On Thursday, Maharashtra added 5,535 cases to take its overall tally to 17,63,055. It was after a fortnight that the state added more than 5,500 cases in a 24-hour cycle; it had recorded 5,011cases on Wednesday. Deaths too rose to 154 on Thursday, after witnessing a slump for the past several days, when the toll had dropped to as low as 46 on November 10.

The cases in Mumbai rose to 924 on Thursday after 871 on Wednesday and 541 on Tuesday. If compared to Monday, when the cases had dropped to a six-month low of 409, cases on Thursday have more than doubled post-Diwali. The cityâs overall tally of coronavirus cases has reached 2,72,455. AMC Suresh Kakani said daily testing numbers have risen to 15,000, and that could have contributed to more cases. âAs part of testing potential spreaders, we have started testing vendors, people working in marketplaces, bus drivers and conductors,â he said, adding a surge could be expected till November 28, which marks the end of a 14-day cycle after Diwali. Testing had dropped to under 4,000 during the Diwali weekend. Deaths, however, in the city continued to be under control. On Thursday, a dozen deaths were attributed to the virus that has so far claimed 10,627 lives in Mumbai. Dr Niteen Karnik, head of medicine at Sion Hospital, said deaths are now predominantly seen in individuals with multiple comorbidities, such as kidney disease, diabetes, obesity etc. Of the 12 victims on Thursday, 10 had comorbidities. Worryingly, 11 of the 12 deaths were among people above the age of 60 years. State officials said CM Uddhav Thackeray had directed the administration to ensure enough beds and medical facilities were available.

"AHMEDABAD: The battle for survival has got more challenging for coronavirus patients. Doctors are now reporting an alarming incidence of rare and serious fungal infection which is preying on patients either battling Covid-19 infection or those who recently recovered. City-based retina and ocular trauma surgeon Parth Rana has reported five cases of mucormycosis, an uncommon fungal infection with 50% mortality rate. Two died while two survived having lost their vision. Four were young males aged between 34 and 47 years. On Friday night, a 67-year-old man from Bhuj too was rushed to Ahmedabad in a critical condition. All have reported enlarged eyeballs which literally bulged out of their sockets. âAll the four patients had a history of uncontrolled sugar and they were on strong drugs including steroids. Their immunity was very low. We believe that these two conditions led to the rapid spread,â said Dr Rana. He said pre-Covid-19, mucormycosis infection takes 15-30 days to spread, but in these four cases, it happened within just 2-3 days. Mucormycosis cases spikeLeading infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel who was part of the national study on mucormycosis fungal infection earlier red-flagged the growing incidence of the serious infection in Covid-19 patients. âWe have recorded 19 cases of mucormycosis infection in Covid-19 recovered patients in the past three months. This is 4.5 times higher than the burden reported conventionally before the pandemic. This is a serious issue and healthcare providers should be extra-cautious as it has a mortality rate of 50%,"" said Dr Patel. Dr Patel said that poor sugar control, use of high doses of steroids and overall compromised immunity due to immune dysregulation and hyper-inflammation in Covid-19 patients has rendered them more vulnerable to the deadly fungal infection.

"Ahmedabad: Pushing final year medical students to join Covid-19 field duty is illegal and arbitrary, the Gujarat Medicos Parents Association, an association formed by parents of medical students has claimed. The students are to face exams in the next 4-5 months, and they should not be expected to sacrifice their studies and to attend Covid-19 duty, it said in a media statement. The Gujarat Medicos Parents Association represents parents of more than 150 final year medical students who are studying in NHL Municipal Medical College and LG Medical College, also known as AMC MET College. Out of 22 medical colleges in Gujarat, including those run by the state government, only the two colleges run by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) have made Covid-19 duty mandatory for third-year Part-I and Part-II MBBS students, it said. Calling the decision by the two colleges as discriminatory, the association is of the view that the duty be made voluntary, as has been done by the government medical college in Surat. âStudents who face final year exams in four or five months cannot be expected to give up their study and compulsorily attend to Covid-19 field duties. Any move to force students to do so is illegal and arbitrary. It is also in contravention to a Union health ministryâs direction that final year MBBS students cannot be assigned any clinical duties,â the Gujarat Medicos Parents Association said. The association said the past four months have not been fruitful since colleges were closed and no classes were held due to the lockdown. The association has criticized NHL and LG Medical College for warning that students not attending to Covid-19 duty would not be allowed to appear for exams. The ministry of health and family welfare, Gujarat government has recently issued a notification where students of various faculties including MBBS, BDS, physiotherapy, BSc nursing, BHMS, BAMS and various other medical and paramedical courses will have to undergo a training programme before they can be deployed in the field.

Meanwhile, the situation of Covid-19 remains grim in the national capital. The latest surge has left the healthcare system here gasping for relief. The hospitals in Delhi, both government and private hospitals, as of now, are left with only nine per cent ICU beds with ventilators, which are extremely crucial for patients with severe disease, as per the Delhi Corona App. Apart from severe patients, the patients with moderate symptoms are made to wait hours before admission in the hospitals. Besides, the non-Covid patients are running from pillar to post just to get hospital beds in the capital city. Meanwhile, citing the proposal sent by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has decided to reinforce the restrictions on number of guests at marriage-related events to 50. The decision came a day after Kejriwal wrote to Lt Governor Anil Baijal, who is also the Chairperson of the DDMA. "

On Tuesday, about 100 cops were tested at the mobile swab collection clinic of KMC near Bhawani Bhawan. Barracks that are located next to the police station are protected. Besides multiple sanitization drives are carried out.

Commissioner Anuj Sharma had wanted to know about the possible reasons for the Covid infection at a few police stations. âHe reminded that the barracks have to be taken care of since that was where the frontline Covid warriors stay. Lalbazar has allocated a separate budget now for its barracks. The fact that many family members of cops have also been diagnosed with Covid has worried us a bit,â said an officer. "

"AHMEDABAD: Citizens and organizations needlessly taking Covid tests has forced the AMC to rethink its strategy of testing. On Thursday, the AMC issued an advisory asking people to go in for testing only if required. Data analysis of Covid testing at kiosks set up by the AMC showed people unnecessarily testing themselves and using up the precious resources. The civic body has now mandated that a citizen can avail of the free Covid testing facility only at his or her local urban health centre or kiosk. A senior officer said that data analysis revealed a person in Navrangpura had got himself tested 15 times in one month and by going to testing kiosks in differnent parts of the city.

He gave different names at the kiosks. At one, he gave his fatherâs name, at another kiosk he gave his fatherâs initials and at a third place he only gave his name without his fatherâs name. However, he gave the same mobile number everywhere. The officer said not less than 100-odd people had got themselves tested for more than 10 times in last two months. The AMC has made it mandatory for shop owners to get their staff tested. So, instead of getting tests done in private laboratories, a jeweller in Ambawadi sent his staff in batches for testing every three days. Another jeweller near Shivranjani had his staff tested at the AMC kiosk every week. The officer said that the situation with regard to banks was similar. Not just the staff but even bank managers were getting tested multiple times. The officials said some of these persons tested every alternate day, and said they feared getting infected as they had to interact with many people daily in their jobs. "

"BENGALURU: Growing number of coronavirus infections outside containment zones and known clusters has triggered fears of a second wave. In the past 10 days, the virus has showed up in areas that were relatively isolated from outbreaks. This is particularly true for districts other than Bengaluru Urban and Rural, and it suggests emergence of new clusters, though the state government maintains that the pandemic has not reached the community transmission stage. Independent health experts believe the government is in denial, pointing to the staggering numbers. Since the pandemic began in March, Karnataka has seen over 4.3 lakh Covid-19 cases and nearly 7,000 deaths. On average, 7,800 fresh cases are reported daily, an indication that the government is struggling to tackle the first wave. But medical education minister K Sudhakar said the governmentâs efforts had produced results. âThe cases have increased, but there is a substantial rise in the recovery rate, which is nearing 6 per cent. Itâs a clear indication that the first wave curve is flattening by the day,â he said. âPeopleâs behaviour during Unlock 4.0 is a cause of worry; they are moving freely without taking much precaution. If this continues, there might be another round of the wave, affecting the economy and normal life again.â Some public-health experts warn that a second wave will stretch healthcare systems to unsustainable levels. âYes, we are seeing a resurgence of cases. We can say that we are seeing some sort of a second wave in certain parts of the state,â said a senior doctor, who is a member of the Karnataka Covid-19 task force. âThe trend of rising cases indicates that the Covid-19 curve may not flatten soon. It will go up further over the next few months and continue into early next year.â Another doctor, from Kalaburagi district, which reported the countryâs first Covid-19 fatality, said the new Unlock phase had coincided with pandemic fatigue, with precaution-weary citizens dropping guard. âSuch a situation can lead to further spread of infection, especially in rural areas,â he added. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhara Babu, who is also a member of the Covid-19 task force, believes the first wave will drag on. âAs of now, the cases are rising and we have not seen any major decline yet. At this stage, itâs difficult to predict with certainty when the first wave will end. In my opinion, more than the second wave, it will be continuation of the first wave,â he said. âMany factors determine the spread of the disease: when the circulation is established, how the movement of people is allowed, what is the extent of testing and how effective is the implementation of public-health measures such as quarantine.â A pandemic of this nature, Dr Babu believes, can end as an endemic or can be contained with a vaccine. âIt might start slowing down by October-end and the curve may hit a plateau and decline,â he added. Some other experts suggest the government should focus on three things: strengthening the mechanism for early detection and containment of patients and disease, augmenting healthcare capacity, and launching massive public awareness campaigns.

With 52 recoveries on Saturday, 1,580 patients have now been discharged after being cured of the virus. Kasturba hospital, Sewagram has made a provision to provide health status information to all the relatives of Covid patients admitted in Covid wards.

"Kanpur: Corona has taken many lives and impacted the livelihoods and economy severely, but some companies and businessmen are busy cashing the fear of the pandemic and selling unverified products like cards worn around the neck claiming to provide a protective shield against the virus. These cards being sold under various names like âCorona Goâ and âCorona Get Outâ are in great demand. The fear of coronavirus is so much that even well-educated people are purchasing these cards and wearing them like identity cards. Medical stores are earning a handsome amount and owners say these cards are selling like hot cake. The price range of these cards varies from Rs 75 to Rs 130, but people are purchasing them without knowing the ingredients inside them and whether they are really beneficial or not. Pranshu Goel, a medical store owner, said he himself does not know what is inside the card as it is fully packed and gives some smell. In June, we used to sell four-five cards every day, but since July the sale has gone up manifold as the number of Covid cases started rising, he added. Goel further said that the span for which the card is effective is also not known but even then people buy them and keep wearing them for several days. Rakesh Malviya, a local, who purchased the card said his friend had advised him to use it saying it acts like a shield against the virus, so he bought it for personal protection. Sanjay Mehrotra, chairman retail medicine market association, said nobody knows what is inside the card. The card gives a camphor-like smell. Earlier, Made in Japan was printed on these cards, but now Made in India cards are also available. Dr Vikas Mishra, associate professor, GSVM medical college, said there is no word or guideline about such cards from ICMR and WHO. Believing that any unverified and untested product would save one from the virus is foolishness and also exposes people to the danger of catching the infection, he added. "
"AHMEDABAD: The holy month of Shravan began on Tuesday with a steady stream of devotees visiting Lord Shiva temples across the city. Some temples have installed special water-channelling systems for devotees to offer âjalâ to the Lord from a distance in this Covid era. Pipes carry the water to be showered on the Shivlings. People could be seen offering âjalabhishekâ in this manner conducive to social distancing at Rameshwar Mahadev Temple in Nirnaynagar, on Tuesday. Local people said that such a system has been in place for a year at Somnath Temple, but it was installed for security reasons. âThe pandemic has changed everything,â said Darshan Patel, who fasts during the entire holy month of Shravan. âThankfully, the situation is under control in Ahmedabad and I could come to Rameshwar Mahadev Temple.â At Manikarneshwar Temple in Maninagar, masks were distributed by priests as âprasadâ to create awareness among the masses about Covid precautions. At Ankur Mahadev Temple in Naranpura, authorities have installed a screen outside to facilitate darshan without compromising social distancing norms. Temple priests said that the number of devotees offering âbiliâ leaves has gone down this year. The leaves of the bael tree are an important part of Lord Shiva worship during this holy month. âEarlier, four devotees used to hire us for making the bili offerings. Just one person has done so this year,â said Kunal Shastri, a priest. Priests charge between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 for making bili offerings during Shravan. This is a good source of income till Diwali. This year, the sellers of bili leaves were absent from their usual Shravan points such as Ellisbridge. "

"LUCKNOW: Medical experts from across the country are trying to formulate a consensus on exploring the role of an age-old drug 'ivermectin' in the treatment of Covid-19. They have also decided to take out a white paper on the drug's efficacy in treating this viral disease. Discussing the role of 'ivermectin' in treating Covid-19 at a national webinar on Monday, Dr Suryakant, president, Indian College of Allergy, Asthma and Applied Immunology, who was a keynote speaker, said that the medical fraternity is perplexed why the powerful pharma industry is not exploring the efficacy of 'ivermectin' which is available at just Rs 50. The webinar, which was organized under aegis of the Academy of Advanced Medical Education, aimed at formulating a white paper for exploring the role of 'ivermectin' in Covid-19 treatment. Eminent national experts Padamsri Dr D Behera from Chandigarh, Dr VK Arora from Delhi, Dr Agam Vora from Mumbai and Dr T Mohan Kumar from Coimbatore also expressed their views on the topic. Dr Suryakant said that 'ivermectin' had been a widely used, FDA approved anti-helminthic drug which is mainly used for worm infections like River blindness, ascariasis, filariasis and other such diseases. Recently, there have been reports of its efficacy against SARS Cov-2 as well, he said. Dr Suryakant, head, department of respiratory medicine, KGMU, presented an overview of the drug and also enlightened participants regarding the interesting history behind the discovery of this drug. In 1970, microbiologist Satoshi Omura collected a soil sample from woods close to a golf course in Kawana, on the south east coast of Honshu, Japan. Omura isolated and cultured a bacteria from this soil and together with Wlliam Campbell from New Jersey tested for its anti-parasitic effects. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 2015 for their discovery. From a fortuitous discovery on a Japanese golf course to a Nobel Prize, the impact of 'ivermectin' on human health to date has been extraordinary. It is not the first time that antiviral properties of 'ivermectin' have been explored. It is shown to be effective against dengue and influenza. The in-vitro antiviral activity of 'ivermectin' against SARS-CoV-2 has further extended the antiviral spectrum of this drug. As 'ivermectin' has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), repurposing it for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy would not be a problem. Dr Suryakant, former president of Indian Chest Society (ICS) and National College Of Chest Physicians (NCCP), said the expert group has reviewed all available evidences and data from clinical trials of 'ivermectin' and would soon present a decisive comment about how it may prove to be beneficial to Covid-19 patients. Nevertheless, compared with other pharmacotherapeutic options currently available in market, 'ivermectin' may have leverage. Adverse effects of 'hydroxychloroquine' or 'lopinavirâand 'ritonavir' combinations are not seen in patients who are on 'ivermectin'. Compared to these drugs, 'ivermectin' is safe and has a lesser side effect profile. Besides, the treatment regimen with 'ivermectin' may turn out to be more cost-effective. The therapeutic regimen with 'hydroxychloroquine' and 'azithromycin' combination comes out to be fiveâsix times more expensive than the one with 'ivermectin'. The same can be said about the other antivirals which are priced at exorbitant rates. These factors may prove 'ivermectin' to be a viable option for India. "
"BENGALURU: In a clear indication of decline in Covid-19 fatalities, Bengaluru has reported single-digit fatalities twice in the past week. In the first seven days of October, the city reported 213 deaths. The number was 71 in the first week of November, recording a 66% month-on month dip. Experts said the trend establishes the preparedness of treating hospitals. According to Dr Ravindra Mehta, chief of pulmonology at Apollo Hospitals, the home testing facility offered by private players and increased testing by the government have been effective in early detection of Covid-19 cases, which helps in preventing Covid mortality. âThe usage of Remdesivir, steroids and oxygen has helped patients immensely,â he said. The rate of fatality can never be zero depending on the condition of the patient at the time of admission and comorbidities suffered, Dr Mehta said, adding patients requiring critical care are now getting more attention as the number of new infections have dropped significantly. âDeaths will increase when the new cases are more. When there are fewer positive cases, the time spent on each patient increases, and as does the result,â he said. BBMP told not to send sick patients to small hospitalsDr Pradeep Rangappa, intensivecare specialist and a member of the state team of tele-ICU overseeing Covid Critical Care, said there is a likelihood of Covid-19 reaching endemicity -- like malaria â that is regularly found among particular people or in a certain area. âPreparedness in the medical community and ease of availability of drugs like Remdesivir have helped patients survive. Complacency should not set in as a second wave is expected,â he added. Doctors said the deaths are occurring largely among sick patients referred to smaller hospitals by BBMP and are shifted to the corporate ones when their condition fails to improve. The expert committee has suggested the BBMP not to send sick and elderly patients to smaller hospitals as they are not equipped to treat the cases. âThough the deaths have reduced, we notice the treatment protocol followed and resources available in all the hospitals are not the same. Thatâs why smaller hospitals are not able to treat the cases efficiently. What matters in Covid survival is the clinical diagnosis of disease progression and medication initiated at the right time,â an expert told TOI. In most corporate hospitals, ICUs are filled with patients referred from other hospitals and their own patients are mainly getting into critical care units. BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said severity of the cases is analyzed while referring a patient to a hospital. âEvery patient wants to go to a bigger corporate hospital. We canât accommodate all patients in such hospitals. It is noticed that in many cases, patients with milder symptoms develop severe sickness gradually. In such cases, based on doctorsâ advice, we shift them from smaller hospitals to corporate hospitals,â he said, adding that the late presentation of the patients is still a major problem in preventing Covid deaths.

The data released by the government also showed that 29.3% of the patients belong to the 41-60 years age bracket, while remaining 10.3% were above the age of 60 years.Experts opine that the high proportion of under-40 cases speaks for gaps in adherence to Covid-19 prevention protocol. âThis is the age group which ventures out of homes for education, vocation and household worksâ¦ Failure on their part to save themselves makes them an easy prey for the pandemic virus,â said a senior doctor in the health department. A surveillance team member added that these are the people who carry the infection back to their homes which is a huge risk to children and elderly. âGovernment alone cannot check contagious diseasesâ¦ the role of people is important not only for their own well-being, but also for the entire community,â said Dr Vikasendu Agarwal, infectious diseases surveillance officer, Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, 2,059 people defeated the pandemic infection in the past 24 hours, taking the total recoveries to 5,14,087 which is over 94% of the total cases reported so far.

"AHMEDABAD: Dr Ramesh Patel, a Paldi-based general physician, contracted Covid-19 in mid-May. He was under medical observation in a hospital for 20 days as he is 70. But soon after his discharge, he resumed duty and consulted more than 40 patients a day. Even as people over 65 are categorized as high-risk, several silver doctors have put duty to serve in pandemic before their own health. âAge is a risk factor for Covid-19, but fortunately I donât have comorbidities. At this age, I don't work for money, I believe that as a doctor, I am most needed in this epidemic. My personal tryst with Covid helps in treating patients,â says the septuagenarian, who says at least three-four of his patients test positive on a weekly basis. Dr Ramesh PatelAs Gujarat is set to mark six months of living with Covid-19 on September 19, the family doctor has emerged to be a pillar of strength for people battling a medical crisis. And while doctors above 65 were exempted from work by state government, many have remained trusted generals for their patients. Dr Pravin KanabarDr Pravin Kanabar, an 85-year old city-based orthopaedic surgeon, is another doctor who refused to hang his boots. âCovid-19 infection is an imminent danger â only yesterday a patientâs HRCT scan revealed patches and he tested positive. But my life's purpose is to relieve the pain of the patients and Iâll continue to do it till my body supports me,â says Dr Kanabar. At Civil Hospital Dr MM Prabhakar, who is in his late sixties, was brought back from retirement to oversee administration of one of the most busy hospitals during pandemic. Dr Maitreya Gajjar, 63, is given extension of service to function as in-charge of the hospital. In Shahpur area, Dr K R Sanghvi has been a regular face for five decades. At 77, Dr Sanghvi still attends to patients, donning two masks, face shield and PPE kit. âOf course itâs difficult, of course itâs dangerous â but tell me, where will these patients go if I stop coming to my clinic? What a touch of doctor can do cannot be replaced by hours of telephonic consultation. The new normal is difficult, but as a doctor, I want to appeal to the citizens to follow the norms and ensure the health of the society,â he said. Dr Pragnesh Vaccharajani, secretary of Ahmedabad Family Physicians Association, told TOI that the city has lost at least two family physicians in senior citizen category â Dr Pankaj Sheth and Dr Sandip Dave â to Covid-19. âInternational guidelines term persons above 65 as a vulnerable group that is highly susceptible to Covid-19. Despite our repeated requests, many senior doctors have continued their practice, choosing duty first,"" said Dr Vacchrajani. "

"Ahmedabad/ Vadodara/ Surat: With major garba organizers and clubs across Gujarat deciding against organizing the nine nights of revelry this year, many allied enterprises are expected to lose a significant chunk of their business. In Ahmedabad, at least six prominent garba organisers have decided to not hold events, not just due to the pandemic but also financial woes.âThe sponsorship market had been falling year on year since last year and lack of funds were evident. This year, when companies have done away with marketing budgets, there is no question of getting sponsorships for events. Besides, the risk of too many people gathering is greater and the time to put together an event and market it is limited,â said Himanshu Shah, organiser of SOI Garba.Sources in city clubs also said that once government directives and guidelines are out a call will be taken but even if the clubs organise garba events, limiting participation will be a challenge even if restricted to club members.While the state government was looking to make some relaxations for Navratri, organisers have dropped events with the safety of participants in mind. The worldâs biggest garba, the United Way Garba, will also not be held this year. Chairperson of the resource development committee of the United Way of Baroda, Hemant Shah, said that the board of the organization had decided against holding the event. âPhysical distancing is not possible as a massive gathering takes place at our venue. Participants can not only infect themselves, but also carry the infection home and infect their families,â he said.The situation is similar in the diamond city as well. Denny Nirban of The Solutions event told TOI, âThis is first time in the last 15 years that we are not organising a commercial garba event in the city. Every year, we organise the garba event at the fully airconditioned indoor stadium. We decided not to organise the event during lockdown itself due to fund constraints and the safety of participants.âRetailers say if garba events are not organized, it will mean huge losses to their business, as Navratri is believed to be the official start to the festive season when sales for a range of products picks up. âIf garbas are not organised, demand for garments will be hit. It is not just traditional attire but people tend to make purchases for official and commercial events during Navratri which will come to a standstill. This will adversely affect retailers and manufacturers,â said Vijay Purohit, president, Gujarat Garment Manufacturersâ Association (GGMA).The situation for caterers and eateries is similar. âNavratri is one festival of the year when not only restaurants but even small eateries have greater sales as people tend to flock eateries before or after the event or to enjoy soak in the festive atmosphere,â said a city-based restaurateur."

"CHANDIGARH: The tiny virus that has gripped the world is now becoming visible on the skin.Several studies and data from Italy, Spain, and the US show that at least 20% of Covid-19-positive cases have skin manifestations. In some patients, these signs appear late during the course of the disease, while in some it precedes the classical symptoms.As we enter the unlock phase amid rising Covid-19 cases and uncertainty, we learn more about the spectrum of these manifestations. Skin, the largest and outermost organ of our body, mirrors our internal body system. Even small changes on the skin can serve as markers to detect many undiagnosed or hidden internal diseases.Chandigarh-based dermatologist Dr Vikas Sharma said: ""The skin manifestations of novel coronavirus were not recognised in the early stages of the pandemic but now as we learn more about, we observe that these range from pseudo-chilblains to a morbilliform (measles-like) exanthem, urticaria, vesicular eruptions, a dengue-like petechial rash and ovate scaling macules, and plaques mimicking pityriasis rosea.""Vesicular eruptions (skin erosion) appeared earliest in the course of Covid-19, prior to any other symptom in 15% of cases. Dr Sharma said: ""These developed on the trunk and extremities, were most common in middle-aged adults, and lasted about 10 days typically. In contrast, the pseudo-chilblains eruption, which has received much attention, occurred later. In almost two-third (59%) of the patients, these lesions developed after other symptoms.â"

"HYDERABAD: With the Covid-19 pandemic showing no signs of abating and the number of cases rising at a breakneck speed in India, insurance regulator, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), is mulling options for mainstreaming the specialised Corona policies that it had directed insurance players to launch by July 10 to help people battle the disease burden. Addressing participants at the Assochamâs National E-Summit on Health Insurance on Friday, TL Alamelu, member (non-life), said the regulator is mulling ways and means to mainstream Covid-19 policies by issuing instructions on either porting, migration or renewal of these policies in the coming days. Coronavirus outbreak: Live updatesIn its current form, Corona Kavach is offered for a tenure of three and half months, six and half months and nine and half months. These policies were launched mainly to cater to people who did not have any comprehensive health insurance policy but were looking to cover themselves against Covid-19. Alamelu pointed out that a majority of policyholders who have taken the Corona policy have opted for cover for nine and half months. She also said that the regulator has been closely monitoring the performance of Corona policies, which have been registering a growth of 15% week-on-week. Meanwhile, speaking about the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) that was launched by the Prime Minister this Independence Day, she said that insurers must take advantage of this platform and encourage policyholders to share their health records on the platform. Digitisation will not only lead to transparency but also solve some of the issues pertaining to pricing norms followed by hospitals. "
"Jaipur: Health minister Raghu Sharma, who is suffering from Covid, has stirred up a controversy by meeting corona patients at the dedicated Covid RUHS Hospital two days ago. The opposition alleged that the minister flouted Covid protocol and demanded action against the minister under the epidemic Act. Sharma tested positive on Monday when he was in Ajmer. On the same day, he reached RUHS Hospital in Jaipur and got admitted. The next day, Sharma went out of his room with doctors and took a round of the hospital where he interacted with patients to get the feedback on the facilities and treatment provided to patients. He had inspected the new 70-ICU beds being constructed at the hospital. Sawai Man Singh Medical College Principal Dr Sudhir Bhandari, RUHS superintendent Dr Ajeet Singh and other doctors and officers accompanied the health minister during the inspection of the facilities. âThe health minister has flouted Covid protocol. Despite testing positive, he took a round of the hospital and openly flouted the guidelines, sending a wrong message to the people. Action should be taken against him under the epidemic Act,â Kalicharan Saraf, former health minister and BJP leader, told TOI. Sharma claimed that he had followed all protocols while inspecting RUHS Hospitalâs different facilities and while interacting with patients. âRUHS is a dedicated Covid-19 hosptial, where each patient is already affected. I visited the hospital on the request of doctors . Itâs a malafide campaign, which has no logical reason,â Sharma said. At present, Sharma is under home isolation at his residence in Civil Lines. RUHS Hospital administration claimed that Sharmaâs meeti ng with patients was not at all against the norms. âVisit of a Covid patient to other Covid patients taking full safety measures wearing mask and face shield is not a violation of the protocol. Visit of a Covid patient to a Covid negative patient without any safety and precautionary measures is a violation of guidelines,â said Dr Ajit Singh, medical superintendent, RUHS Hospital. He said there was no chance of spread of the virus. Director health (state) Dr KK Sharma said, âHe (health minister) was wearing mask, face shield, following social distancing when he met Covid patients. Also, he reviewed the facilities and preparation for future at RUHS Hospital at a time when cases are increasing daily. He followed all the protocols.â "
"AHMEDABAD: After nearly 600 labourers, especially those working at PSP construction site and bullet train site, tested Covid positive, AMC launched surveillance at major railway stations hoping to isolate more labourers before they enter the city taking the virus to work. Three days of testing passengers from three trains--Rajdhani Express (Delhi-Aâbad), Gorakhpur-Aâbad Express from UP and Muzaffarpur-Aâbad Express from Bihar --revealed more passengers on Rajdhani tested positive than two other trains mainly bringing in labourers back to state industries. Top sources at Ahmedabad railway station said that of 6,500 passengers disembarking these three trains checked for Covid in four days beginning Monday, 112 tested positive. âOf these 84, 82 people who tested positive had travelled by Rajdhani. This roughly calculates to three out of every four passengers who tested positive travelled by Rajdhani,"" said a senior railways official. Only 30 passengers who tested positive travelled by Gorakhpur and Muzaffarpur trains. The railway officials were also surprised that a higher number of 90 passengers who travelled by 3 AC or 2AC were carrying Covid infection compared to general class passengers whose number was only 20-odd. Popping a paracetamol continues to be the biggest weapon of people in general to avoid being screened and quarantined in case their body temperature lights up thermal scan. âMany Covid-positive passengers confessed to taking paracetamol tablets before boarding and disembarking the trains.

Mahato, who was posted at the special branch, was admitted to a hospital exactly a week ago â on September 3 â with major breathing trouble. âWe had shifted him to a private hospital at Mukundapur. But unfortunately, he could not be saved. With his death, we have lost another colleague after a gap of almost three weeks,â said an officer at Lalbazar.Mahato had been on active Covid duty till the end of August, his colleagues said. He was put on ventilation before he breathed his last at a hospital off EM Bypass. While he did not have any known serious medical history, doctors at the hospital claimed the condition of a couple of vital organs deteriorated, thus requiring advanced medical intervention.More than 6,000 police personnel have been infected across the state, including as many as 2,136 from Kolkata Police unit alone. A total of 1,932 have recovered. There are now 204 active cases, a jump from the last week of August, when the cases had gone down to 130. Out of all the nine previous deaths in Kolkata Police, including an ACP and an inspector, none of them had any major co-morbidity issue and all were aged between 45 and 55 years. The average daily new cases, which went down below 10 in August, is now back between 15 and 20. Kolkata police took to its social media handles to pay their last respect for Mahato."
"BENGALURU: Almost one out of every two Covid-19 patients in Bengaluru Urban chose to stay in home isolation rather than get admitted to designated hospitals or Covid Care Centres (CCC), suggesting panic and fear over contracting the virus appears to have decreased drastically. From July 1, data accessed shows just under 44% (43.9%) patients opted to stay in home isolation. The capital city currently has approximately 36,000 active cases. However, as on Thursday, of 16,348 beds available in designated hospitals and CCCs, only 7,481 were filled while 3,679 patients were being treated in private hospitals. As many as 15,480 patients were in home isolation as per data shared by BBMPâs War Room, a pointer to the fact that many Covid-19 patients preferred the option. War Room officials attribute this to a number of reasons some of which are that they are mostly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, have facilities to isolate at home, were not scared of the virus and feared hefty hospitals bills. Shyamsundar S, a home isolation volunteer in Kumaraswamy Layout, claimed citizens have come to understand that the virus is not lethal provided it is identified in the early stages of infections. Patients prefer home isolation as they are wary of pathetic conditions in government facilities and hefty bills in private facilities, he added. âEarlier, neighbours would stigmatize Covid patients and treat them as if they have committed a heinous crime, but now we find many of them helping out positive people. The awareness is much higher than before,â Shyamsundar said. Aishwarya K, an employee of a private firm who traveled from Delhi two months ago, tested positive on arrival. She said she was given a choice to isolate at home or could go to the CCC at GKVK. âI chose to stay at home as my mother was there to help me and I was not in a position to afford private hospital bills,â said Aishwarya. âI think the stigma over contracting the disease was still there at that time as my house was barricaded and some of the residents around refused to even interact with us even after my isolation period ended. But now, in the lane I live, another person has tested positive and is in home isolation. But peopleâs perception has changed.â Speaking to TOI, Randeep D, special commissioner, BBMP, said in the first few months when the pandemic hit, many people panicked over contracting the infection, but now they are more aware of the disease and what they need to do once are infected. âSome people who do not want to infect other members of their family â especially if there are children or aged people at home â opt to go to a private or government hospital or a Covid Care Centre,â Randeep said. âOthers prefer to choose home isolation especially if they have someone to assist them during the isolation period. Most patients who choose to recover at home, are all asymptomatic,â he added. chennai Move to retain e-pass is well thought out: Tamil Nadu CM https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/move-to-retain-e-pass-is-well-thought-out-tamil-nadu-cm/articleshow/77795134.cms "

"AHMEDABAD/ VADODARA/SURAT/ RAJKOT: Within hours of the Supreme Court demanding an action-taken report from four states including Gujarat on the Covid-19 situation amid a fresh surge in cases, the state government revised its guidelines for weddings and social gatherings. According to the new guidelines, only 100 guests will be allowed at weddings, effective Tuesday midnight. The government halved the permitted number of guests from the earlier 200. The decision has left brides, grooms and their families grappling with added uncertainties for their special days. Trusha Patel (name changed), a resident of Ahmedabad, is to be married on December 8. Hardik Patel, her brother, said, âAll the ceremonies have been planned for the night and the groomâs family is scheduled to arrive in the evening from Mehsana. However, with curfew imposed, we will have to reschedule the entire event so that the couple can leave for Mehsana before 9pm, due to the curfew. We will have to shift the event entirely. Weâre in the process of figuring it out and trying to shorten it as much as possible.â Similarly, Rajkot resident Siddharth Vekariyaâs wedding is scheduled for December 2 and other ceremonies for December 1, both in the evening. As soon as the night curfew was imposed in Rajkot, for an indefinite period, all his planning went haywire. Jaydeep, his brother, said, âWeâve asked the hotel to shift the event to the morning. We are waiting for a reply from them. Letâs see how things pan out. With the fresh guidelines, we arenât sure how to curtail the guest list.â The second wave of Covid-19 infections has proven to be the last nail in the coffin for the weddings industry. Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurantsâ Association (HRA), Gujarat, said, âSome 14 events have been cancelled at our hotel alone. Out of sheer confusion and uncertainty, people are limiting affairs to the home or cancelling them outright. The second wave of infections during peak wedding season will dampen the sentiment of people and will prove detrimental to the industry which had barely seen any sign of revival.â This year, the number of muhurats is low and thus many events are being held in a single day. Kunal Desai, a priest said, âThe most wedding muhurats are during November 30-December 2 and December 7-10. Most weddings are planned for these days and the venues will be packed.â Sonika Chaturvedi, general manager, Courtyard by Marriott, said, âWe have received requests for rescheduling events and cancellations as well. The spike in Covid-19 cases and curfew has shaken the confidence of guests and it is bound to affect business.â âWe used to host at least 15 weddings in a month in the peak wedding season of November-December. Now, business has fallen to 5% of earlier levels,â said Pratik Patel, who owns a party plot in Piplod, Surat.

"VADODARA: Staffers of state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara bid a tearful farewell to one of hospitalâs corona warriors on Monday. Dayaram Vasava, a 44-year-old male nurse, who had tested Covid-19 positive before a week, passed away due to Covid-19 related complications on Sunday. Vasavaâs is the first death of a corona warrior from a public hospital in Vadodara. The government hospitalâs nursing staff, doctors and other employees lined up to offer flowers and bid farewell to Vasava outside the post-mortem room of the hospital, the biggest government hospital of Central Gujarat. âHe was a very dear friend to me. After he tested positive of Covid-19 on November 17, he was under home quarantine. But on Sunday, he suddenly developed some complications and faced breathing problems after which he was on his way to hospital. He was brought to emergency ward of the hospital but doctors declared him brought dead,â said nursing associationâs secretary Kamlesh Parmar. Vasava, who worked as male nursing assistant, had served the government hospital for 15 years. âIn June, he was also sent on deputation to Ahmedabad for Covid duty and even at SSG Hospital, he had handled Covid duties a couple of times,â said Parmar. According to the state governmentâs announcement, the health workerâs family will receive Rs 50 lakh as compensation. As per the policy, kin of health workers who die due to coronavirus infection in the line of duty are paid the compensation in the form of insurance pay-out. "
"AHMEDABAD: The forensic medicine department at BJ Medical College has so far carried out four biological autopsies of patients at Civil Hospital who had died due to Covid-19. Dr Kalpesh Shah, professor and head of the department, on Monday told mediapersons that the department intends to carry out at least 50 such autopsies to understand the effect of the infection on internal organs. âOur focus will be to understand the impact of the infection on organs such as the heart, and phenomena such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that often leads to a sudden collapse of patients during or after the hospitalization period. We will need patients of different age groups and with different parameters to understand how Covid-19 affected them and led to their deaths,â said Dr Shah. The department carried out its first autopsy on Diwali day. Civil Hospital officials said a special negative pressure chamber has been created at the old postmortem room which has been refurbished for the sole purpose of Covid-19 related autopsies. Itâs been designed and created with national and international guidelines in mind, said officials. Dr Shah said special staff is deployed at the 1,200-bed hospital to counsel the kin of the deceased patients. âItâs a very important medical procedure to fight the disease and we need public support. Our staff is working round the clock for the purpose,â he said, adding that the consent of relatives is mandatory to carry out an autopsy. "
"After recording over 97,000 cases per day in September, the corona curve in India seems to register a fall this month. The less number of cases per day gave hope to the light markets in Kolkata this festive season. From strings of fairy lights to Chinese lanterns, pineapple danglers, LED candles and crystal LEDs â the electric light alleys of the city, Chandni Market and Ezra Street, are decked up to welcome the Diwali and Kali Puja crowd. âThank god the market is open and buyers are coming. New stocks are here. Perhaps the market will not be as busy as previous years. But we are hopeful that the next two weekends are going to be good,â said MD Selim, a seller from Chandni Market. Is it Indian? Or is it Chinese?Though the sellers claim these items to be of Indian make, most of the fancy lights, including crystal LEDs, metal lanterns, LED candles and others, are goods from China. âHow do we know where the lights have come from? We get it from the suppliers and they say the lights are acquired from Delhi and Mumbai,â said MD Mansoor Alam, who has been in this business for decades in Chandni. âI stock up from Burrabazar. The suppliers are charging us more, citing a poor supply. Most of the boxes have âMade In Chinaâ stickers on them. How do we know? We donât make them,â he reasoned. So, which are the lights of Indian make, we asked MD Anwar, one of the sellers. âCandles and earthen diyas are primarily made in India,â said the seller, who also has a lot of fancy candles in stock. âBut scented candles, mini hurricane lamps seem to be Chinese products,â he added. Corona lights? No wayThe buzz around the light market is the introduction of corona lights. However, even after a thorough search, corona lights are nowhere to be spotted. âWeâve heard about those corona lights. It is nothing but a green sphere with spikes. But we did not stock that light. Who would want to buy that grotesque thing that impacted our lives so badly? Diwali is an auspicious occasion. Why put a corona shadow on it?â said Ranjan Prasad, a light seller from Ezra Street, who was seen selling a variety of fairy lights, disco lights, LED lantern, crystal balls et al. According to S Ahmed, a seller on Ezra Street, the price of the items hasnât increased this year. âThe market is yet to pick up. Hence, we did not increase our prices even when the suppliers were charging us more. We are incurring a bit of pain today for a better tomorrow.â "
"HYDERABAD: Additional SP of Jagtial district K Dakshina Murthy died of Covid-19 on Wednesday morning.

"AGARTALA: The Union ministry of health and family welfare has decided to send a team of experts to find out the reason for the sudden spike in death toll and review the stateâs strategy for the Covid battle. Over 100 people have lost their lives in the state in the past 20-odd days, as the case count in the state surged to to 15,500. âWe hope the central team visits Tripura this week to check the stateâs strategy for the Covid pandemic. The government expects the team to suggest to the state what more needs to be done to prevent further loss of life,â government spokesperson Ratan Lal Nath said, adding that the state government too was worried about the surge in death toll in the state. âThe team will check on the the critically ill patients, report and suggest measures to reduce mortality,â Nath said, adding that the state government has ordered an inquiry into allegations of lack of facilities and adequate infrastructure in the Agartala Government Medical College (AGMC), the only super specialty hospital of the state dedicated to Covid treatment. He, however, added that though Agartala had reported maximum infection in the state, but when compared to other states, the figures are relatively lower. Explaining the spurt in deaths in Tripura, a senior health official said, âWhenever any patient is brought to the hospital with a serious ailment such as trauma cases, they are sent for Covid tests and until the report arrives, the patient is left without treatment for a couple of hours. If the report is positive, the patient is shifted to Covid hospital where he/she is treated for the virus, and not his/her actual ailment. This has led to some deaths.â "

"NEW DELHI: Breaking all previous records, Covid-19 cases again reached a single-day highest at 5,891. On Thursday, the city had reported 5,739 cases while 5,673 cases had been reported the previous day â both single-day peaks. For the last eight days, the daily number of Covid cases has been consistently rising, except on Monday, when only 2,832 cases were reported due to fewer number of tests conducted. A total of 47 people died on Friday, taking the total number of fatalities to 6,470. In the last 24 hours, 4,433 people have recovered. Compared with a day ago, the tally of both deaths and recoveries has increased. The number of Covid-19 cases marginally increased, despite a small dip in the number of tests. Among 59,641 people tested on Friday, 9.8% tested positive, taking the active cases to 32,363. The government has said it is prepared and closely monitoring the situation, and stressed that there is no immediate crisis of beds or health infrastructure. Experts attributed the spike to aggressive contact tracing and testing, particularly the jump in RT-PCR tests. Other than that, seasonal change and pollution, which push respiratory illnesses, and lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour among people were also blamed. Health minister Satyendar Jain has speculated that it may be the âthird Covid-19 waveâ, but also remarked that it would be too early to conclude that without watching the trend for a week. The Covid-19 positivity rate, which was 9.5% a day before, climbed to 9.8%, one of the highest. However, the recovery rate is also at one of the highest levels. Till now, Delhi has reported 3.8 lakh Covid-19 positive cases out of which 3.4 lakh people have recovered, according to the daily update released by the health department. The rising number of active cases has pushed the number of containment zones to 3,158. "
"KOLKATA: The first lot of Covaxin, the indigenous Covid vaccine candidate, is expected to reach a city hospital â National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) â in about a week for phase III clinical trials that could, if all goes well, start as early as next month. NICED is one of three Kolkata hospitals in the vanguard of the vaccine trials being conducted across the country, the other two being School of Tropical Medicine (STM) and College of Medicine & Sagore Dutta Hospital, where different vaccine candidates are scheduled to be tested shortly. At NICED, as a part of the pan-India phase III trials of Covaxin being conducted across multiple centres, 1,000 volunteers will be part of the study, said Shanta Dutta, director, ICMR-NICED. âIf all goes well, we should be able to kick of the trials by the first week of December,â she added. As many as 28,500 volunteers across the country will be part of the third phase of the trial for Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech and ICMR. The trial at NICED will be placebo-controlled: half the participants will receive inert placebos; the rest will be administered the vaccine candidate. âMany have shown interest in volunteering for the study,â Dutta said. âWe will soon start screening the volunteers to select those who fit our criteria.â STM will be part of the phase III trial of Covovax, another Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The instituteâs ethics committee is expected to meet on Tuesday to clear the decks for the trial. Here, 100 volunteers will be part of the trial. Many, including doctors, have expressed interest in becoming volunteers, said insiders. Originally developed by US-based vaccine manufacturer Novavax, Covovax is the Indian version of the original vaccine formulated at Serum Institute of India (SII) in collaboration with Novavax. In addition to SII and Novavax, ICMR will be sponsoring the trial at STM. Unlike other vaccine trials, no placebo will be given to volunteers at the STM study. Sources at the hospital said this would be a âtwo-arm trialâ, where all volunteers will be given active vaccines: either SIIâs Covovax or NVX-CoV2373 by Novavax. âWhile the trials at NICED and STM have been finalized, we are open to any good proposal for Covid vaccine trials,â said Narayan Swaroop Nigam, the state health secretary. The trial at Sagar Dutta hospital â of the Russian Sputnik V â will be part of a pan-India clinical trial being conducted by Indian pharma company Dr Reddyâs. Dr Reddyâs Lab has joined hands with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V, as well as its distribution. âAn expert team has been asked to look into the proposal of conducting stage III trials at the hospital,â said a senior health department official. âOf the more than 150 Covid-19 candidate vaccines that are at various pre-clinical or clinical development stages, nine are either undergoing, awaiting or just completing phase III trials. These belong to four broad categories, based on their mode of discovery. Covovax is a protein-based nanoparticle (virus-like protein) vaccine. It is likely to be a safer vaccine as it contains a synthetic protein component and not a whole virus nor a carrier (vehicle) virus,â said Santanu Kumar Tripathy, who heads the department of clinical and experimental pharmacology at STM. Covaxin is an inactivated whole-virus vaccine which uses a fully destroyed virus. Sputnik V falls into the category of viral vector vaccine, in which another virus is used to carry the DNA encoding of the needed immune response. "

"Bhopal: With one person testing positive in Singrauli district late on Mondayâall the four districtsâRewa, Satna, Sidhi and Singrauliâ of the Vindhya region are now Covid-19 infected. The first case of Vindhya region was reported from Rewa district on May 4. On May 7, two persons tested positive in Satna district. This was followed by three positive cases in Sidhi district on May 12. On May 18, one person tested positive in Sidhi, bringing all the four districts under the grip of Covid infection. In a press statement issued on Tuesday, district collector of Singrauli, KVS Choudhary, said that the 19-year-old patient had come in a truck from Mumbai and had reached Rajdiha village on May 15. He was kept in home quarantine and when his condition deteriorated, he was admitted to the district hospital on May 16. His test reports, received on Monday night, confirmed him to be positive, the collector said in the statement. The patient was shifted to Rewa for treatment on Tuesday, Choudhary said. It is noteworthy that in Sidhi district too, so far, fivepeople have been tested positive and all are related to the migrant labourers who had returned from other states recently. In Rewa, it was a local patient who was first tested positive. However, a few migrant labourers also tested positive, taking the count to 14 positive patients. In Satna, a majority among the nine positive patients are migrant labourers, said sources. "
"MUMBAI: The share of Covid positive patients in the 50-plus age group is significantly higher in Mumbai than in the state. As on Saturday, 2.2 lakh or 32.5% of the 6.7 lakh Covid patients in the state were aged above 50 compared with 57,535 or 42.5% of the more than 1.3 lakh in Mumbai. A closer look at the age-wise distribution shows nearly 19.5% of the total cases in Mumbai are in the age group of 50-59 compared with 16% in the state. Similarly, 13.5% of the total cases in Mumbai are in the 60-69 age bracket as against 10.2% in the state. Senior officials said in metros such as Mumbai and Pune, the incidence of lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and diabetes is higher, which makes the population more vulnerable to Covid-19. Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and a member of the state death audit committee, seconded that the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was higher in Mumbai and combined with stress they make people more susceptible. âCities like Mumbai have a huge working population in the 50-plus age group that was out and about doing work during the lockdown. This could be one of the reasons for their higher share in the total infections,â said an official. Another official said since Maharashtra is a highly urbanized state, a higher proportion of the elderly population is still active. This was one of the reasons why all municipal corporations were asked to undertake age-specific screening campaigns. The majority of Covid fatalities are from this age group and in people with comorbidities. In Mumbai, more than 80% of deaths have occurred among those aged above 50, with the 50-59 bracket alone contributing to over 25% of the deaths. Last week, the civic body had come out with a circular mandating hospitalization for all patients aged above 50 with or without symptoms. It was later revised and those without comorbidities and symptoms were told to isolate themselves at home. BMCâs additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said a delay in reporting on time to hospitals was also leading to deaths among the elderly. Of the 588-odd deaths analysed in August, merely 200 had reported to a hospital within a day or two of giving their swabs. "

"PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Medical experts came out in support of the Covid-19 treatment unit at the PCMC-run Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital on Friday, a day after reports suggested that the civic body was contemplating turning the hospital into a non-Covid facility. The hospital has treated over 7,000 Covid-19 cases till August 31 and recorded a 87% recovery, which is substantial to show the hospitalâs merit in treating the patients, Kaustubh Kahane, ENT specialist at YCM hospital, said. He said since the jumbo facility and other makeshift facilities have been set up recently, it would not be wise to shift all the caseload to them from the YCM hospital. âWe have a staff of around 250 medical professionals. Though it has been a week since the jumbo facility has been set up, the number of patients at the YCM hospital has not gone down,â Kahane said.

"JAIPUR: The number of Covid mortalities per 10-lakh population in the state is much less than the national average. Despite the state reporting 381 Covid deaths in October, which accounted for 20% of the fatalities since the first death was reported, its mortality is just 23 per 10-lakh population, in comparision with the national average of 87. The health department claimed that it created beds for critical care Covid treatment not only in government hospitals, but also in private ones, which proved helpful in preventing mortality. A senior health department official said mortality per 10-lakh population was much less than the national average. âThe state government has taken measures from reserving 30% beds for Covid treatment in Jaipur and other parts of the state. More ICUs and ventilators were allocated for Covid treatment and beds with oxygen support increased manifold,â said a senior health department official. Besides expanding critical care, the health department is taking measures on preventing spread of the virus. âThere is no specific medicine and vaccine available in the markets which are spefically made for Covid treatment. In such a situation, masks are the best option available to ward off the risks. The government is distributing 1crore masks among people and the government is planning to formulate a law on masks,â said health minister Raghu Sharma.

"JAIPUR: The assembly that resumed on Friday to discuss the economic impact of Covid-19 in the state had to be adjourned thrice following heated arguments between the ruling party and the opposition members. Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal accused BJP MLA Kali Charan Saraf of politicising the debate on Covid. Saraf had made some direct allegations â which were later expunged from the House proceedings â against Dhariwal. As other ministers came in defence of Dhariwal, the Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas got into acrimonious arguments, while other members of the treasury and the Opposition benches stood up shouting and gesturing at each other. Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya, who was in the Speakerâs chair then, had to adjourn the House for 30 minutes at 12.19pm. Rajendra Pareek replaced Malviya when the House resumed but he too had to adjourn the proceedings twice as the pandemonium continued. Finally, Speaker C P Joshi returned from his chamber to take charge of the House proceedings at 2pm as chaos continued even after three adjournments and ordered to expunge everything said by Saraf and other members during the arguments until then. Joshi, however, gave Saraf another opportunity to speak, asking him to start afresh without making âpoliticalâ allegations. Earlier in the day, the debate on Covid and its impact on the state was opened by health minister Raghu Sharma, who highlighted the Ashok Gehlot-led governmentâs efforts in checking the spread of the virus and the relief provided to the needy. The opposition members argued that the ground reality was different from what the health minister claimed, as neither proper treatment nor promised ration was reaching the poor. Health minister Sharma said the accuracy of antigen tests in detecting Covid patients was doubtful. Sharma said the rising number of positive cases was not much of a concern as the state had a high recovery rate (above 76%) and low mortality rate (1.38%) compared to the rest of India (73% and 1.92%, respectively). âWe strengthened our health infrastructure during the lockdown. Rajasthan has 8,090 oxygen-supported beds and 1,672 ICU beds for Covid patients,â said Sharma. He added that plasma therapy was available in five districts, while Jhalawar and Ajmer would soon have it. Sharma said two injections costing around Rs 40,000 each were being provided to Covid patients from poor families free of cost. BJP MLA Anita Bhadel highlighted how the officials were neutralising governmentâs efforts by not letting the relief reach the needy. Bhadel told the House that e-mitra servers remained shut for up to eight hours a day once the poor got themselves registered for free ration. âThese registrations were later cancelled citing technical reasons while the poor, who were unaware of all this, kept waiting for the ration,â Bhadel said. She stressed, âThe system is corrupt and making money in the pandemic.â "
"VADODARA: Corona not only lived her times and wowed all with her beauty then, she still bewitches onlookers down the ages more than a century later. However, had she been christened with the moniker now, she would have settled for her real name, Kate. And yet the bard said, âWhatâs in a name?â With pandemic writ large on our minds, Corona seems to be a synonym for fear with people shunning anything slightly resembling the dreaded virusâ spherical particle adorned with deadly red spikes. But not this Corona with her infectious smile at the Baroda Museum and Art Gallery (BMAG). In fact, she has been luring art-lovers with her radiance for a quick selfie, up and close! This painting has been adorning a wall in the museum for more than 100 years now, but needed a pandemic to propagate her fame. âEver since pandemic struck, my interest in Corona seems to have spiralled with me visiting the museum several times to watch the mesmerizing oil painting in the last few days,â chuckled Chandrashekhar Patil, an art-curator. The original artwork on canvas by Italian-British painter Charles Perugini is on display in the European paintings section in the museum. âThe lady is the daughter of famed novelist Charles Dickens and also the wife of Perugini, who is devoted to her beauty. He made several paintings of his wife, who was also known as Kate. Mesmerized by her bewitching looks, he titled this painting Corona as it resembles the expression of crowning,â explained Sandip Joshi, art-historian who gave a talk on Indian-European painting styles in the city on Thursday. BMAG curator Vijay Patel, who too said that Corona is gaining popularity, stated that the museum houses 210 oil paintings, and has the largest collection of European paintings in south-east Asia. âI was eager to walk through the European paintings gallery in the museumâs 19th century paintings. But my curiosity shot up when I heard about Corona and attended the walk. I was completely mesmerized by the artwork and her beauty,â said Rohit Khindkar, owner of a Pune-based software firm, who is in the city to attend the ongoing heritage week. "
"Kanpur: Additional chief secretary Alok Kumar held a Covid review meeting with senior officials in Kanpur and expressed grave concern over the number of deaths due to novel coronavirus infection in the district and directed them to adopt all required measures to bring down the casualties. Kumar, additional chief secretary, infrastructure and industrial development, presided over the review meeting at the integrated control room in the Kanpur municipal corporation building late Tuesday and asked the officials to take urgent steps to curb the infection spread and ensure better treatment of the Covid patients. The meeting was attended by district magistrate Alok Tiwari, municipal commissioner Akshay Tripathi, CDO Mahendra Kumar, ADM finance & revenue Virendra Pandey and chief medical officer Anil Mishra. Kumar directed the officials to depute specialist doctors at Covid hospitals so that mortality rate is reduced.

Kumar told the officials to prepare a micro plan for sample collection and ensure all protocols and standards are followed during collection of samples. He directed health department officials to collect samples of patients having Covid symptoms as soon as they are reported. âIf a sample tests positive, decide without delay whether the patient needs to be home quarantined or has to be admitted to a hospital. No laxity is acceptable in this,â said Kumar. âContact tracing and subsequent sample collection should be done earnestly and promptly so that infection doesnât aggravate. Send the rapid response teams to check facilities for home isolation,â he added. âIdentify the Covid patients also suffering from other serious ailments and ensure special care for them to prevent casualties,â he said. Kumar directed the district magistrate to inspect private hospitals and ensure Covid patients get proper treatment and death rate is reduced. He told the officials to fast track the procedure for increasing beds in Kanshiram Hospital and LLR Covid hospital. "
"BHUBANESWAR: As the number of Covid cases and deaths continue to rise, the situation in Ganjam district is proving to be worrisome. The percentage of death vis-Ã -vis positive cases in Ganjam is 1%, which is around four times the mortality rate of 0.25% in the rest of the state. With four more persons dying of Covid-19, all from Ganjam, the death toll due to the virus in the state went up to 56. A record 755 tested positive, raising the total cases to 11,956 while all-time high of 565 recovered from the infection. This raised the number of cured patients to 7,972. While 29 districts together have reported 22 Covid deaths, Ganjam alone has reported 34. The number of positive cases in the migration-prone southern Odisha district at 3,416 is around 28% of the stateâs total positive cases. The active positive cases in Ganjam (1489) is around 38% of the state total (3911). Experts said that Ganjam had a similar tale when the HIV infection was spreading fast between 2005 and 2010. Sonamali Bag, former director of medical education and training, said the way Ganjam was more vulnerable to HIV because of its migrant population, the same way it is at risk from Covid-19. âSanitation and hygiene of distressed migrants generally remain compromised,â said Bag, who has also served as in-charge of anti-retroviral therapy centre for treatment of HIV/AIDS individuals in Ganjam. The district accounts for more than two lakh of the total 6.5 lakh returnees to the state in the past two-and-half months. A majority of them have returned from Surat and Ahmedabad in Gujarat. âSince the number of cases is more in Ganjam, many vulnerable sections of people may have been exposed. The more deaths may be because of this,â Bag said. It must be noted that around 50% of the patients who died in the state had diabetes, while many had hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among other underlying conditions. As on May 31, of the 51,266 HIV/AIDS individuals in the state, Ganjam contributes to more than 16,000, which is around 31.3%. âBeing immuno-compromised, the HIV+ people are more vulnerable to complications from Covid if they get infected,â Bag said, adding HIV and Covid co-relation should be studied to understand the situation better. Ajay Parida, director of Institute of Life Sciences, which has been undertaking a genomic study on the novel coronavirus in the state, said, âThe reason behind higher deaths in Ganjam need further study. Though, when compared to rest of Odisha, the death in Ganjam is more, the sample size is still too less to come to a definite conclusion.â Parida said one must note the fact that even the death situation in Ganjam is far better compared to the national average of 2.7%. The new Covid deaths include two men aged 32 and 48, both having diabetes, a 41-year-old hypertensive and another 58-year-old man with no underlying conditions. Two other cancer patients who had tested Covid-19 positive died from cancer in Sundargarh and Bhadrak districts raising deaths of Covid patients due to non-Covid reasons to 17. "

Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, Federation of Sectors Welfare Association, Chandigarh, (Foswac), said, âIt is clear the administration has left it all in the hands of citizens. If they are making such decisions, they should at least take public opinion in consideration. Since there is no curfew now, criminals can easily move out. Drink and driving check posts should be set up, keeping all safety measures in hand. Police should be vigilant in the city as well as the borders too.â Many residents asked when the city is about to touch 5,000 Covid-19 cases, why did officials announce relaxations, while neighbouring states are still adhering to the norms. Pankaj Gupta, president, RWA, Sector 38 West, said, âWhen there were hardly any cases in the city, the administration was so strict, but the tables have turned now. Public safety should be the top priority. Not only Covid-19 cases, when officials have taken away the power of police officials to stop anyone who will be roaming after 10pm, crime rate will increase too.â Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (Crawfed) president Hitesh Puri said Crawfed welcomes the decision.

They will be given Rs 500 per day as a stipend. âThe students have been given the necessary training,â said Gupta.

"NEW DELHI: The capital on Sunday reported 4,136 fresh Covid-19 cases â the highest single-day spike in 37 days. From 7.4% on Saturday, the positivity rate climbed up to 8.4% â the highest in 48 days. A total of 33 fatalities were reported on Saturday against 36 a day earlier. For more than a month, Delhi has been recording less than 4,000 new Covid cases each day, but since Friday, the number of cases has been peaking 4,000 fresh cases daily. The last time the city had recorded more fresh cases was on September 17, when 4,431 cases were reported and the positivity rate stood at 7.38%. Health minister Satyendar Jain, however, said the Covid situation was under control and the state government is extremely alert. Jain claimed the Dr Paul expert committee had stated that due to the festive and winter season, Delhi was likely to witness 12,000-14,000 cases a day, âbut at the moment, the number of cases per day is around 4,000, so the situation is containedâ. âOur full focus is on containment and as soon as someone is found positive, we are immediately carrying out contact tracing and isolation,â Jain said at a press conference on Sunday, adding that Delhi government is fully prepared for the festive and winter season. The capital conducted 49,069 Covid-19 tests in the past 24 hours, which included 14,627 RTPCR/CBNAAT/TrueNat tests and 34,442 rapid antigen tests. The number of patients who have recovered in the past day is 3,826, with the recovery rate at a comfortable 90.7%. The positivity rate in Delhi has steadily risen from less than 6% a week ago to going above 6%, then 7% and is at 8.4% at the moment. The last time the positivity rate was higher in Delhi was on September 7, when the positivity rate stood at 9%. The number of active cases stood at 26,744 on Sunday, out of which 16,115 are in home isolation. Jain said the reason behind the spike in positivity rate is extensive testing of those who have come in contact of patients. âEveryone who has come in contact with those testing positive are traced and tested. If one person is found positive, there is a high possibility of many people in the family also testing positive,â he said, adding that there are many cases of the entire family testing positive for Covid-19. âCorona does not seem to be ending anytime soon and till the time there is a vaccine or medicine, we have to remain cautious and wear masks and maintain social distancing,â the minister added.

"Kolkata: The government is scaling up high dependency units (HDU) beds in its non-Covid hospitals for the treatment of corona suspects waiting for test reports. Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital (CNMCH) will have 40 HDU beds in its SARI (severe acute respiratory illness) ward that has currently 100 beds. âMany patients are visiting hospitals with severe respiratory distress. We cannot admit them in Covid hospital till their corona status is confirmed. HDUs are required to treat these patients,â said a senior health official. RG Kar Medical College will also come up with a 60-bedded SARI ward that will have 10 HDU beds. This will be in addition to the existing 40-bedded SARI ward in the hospital for Covid patients. âThe ventilators and other equipment for HDU beds have already arrived. These beds should become functional in next two or three days,â said a source at the hospital. "
"Vadodara: This 37-year-old doctor has been put through the Covid grind â both at SSG Hospital and GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri â the two major Covid designated hospitals of Vadodara. After he was sent to Ahmedabadâs Civil Hospital on deputation last month, he even had a close brush with the dreaded contagion. But that helped Dr Suketu Dave, who was part of the first batch of 19 resident doctors who were on deputation at Ahmedabad, emerge even stronger. Donning his life-saving personal protection equipment (PPE) kit again, he jumped into the battle zone inside Ahmedabad civil hospitalâs Covid ICU, treating all critically ill patients. âI have had a chance of working at all the major hospitals and I have seen all kinds of patients â from normal, asymptomatic to symptomatic and critically ill,â said Dave, who served at the isolation ward of civil hospital between May 6 and May 12. Two days after he returned to Vadodara, the resident doctor who finished his MBBS from Surat and is pursuing MD (medicine) from Baroda Medical College, started showing symptoms and tested positive of Covid-19. After finishing his home quarantine period Dave joined duty at SSG Hospital on June 16 where he was assigned duty at non-Covid ward. Since June 21, however, he has re-joined Covid duties at the 1,200-bedded civil hospital in Ahmedabad. âAt times, it gets a little testing when a young patient you are hoping will recover, suddenly succumbs,â said Dave, whose Covid duty will end on Tuesday. On Wednesday, doctorâs day, Dave will return to quarantine firming his resolve to fight the virus even more vigorously. "

"Kolkata: A Kolkata Municipal Corporation executive health official, Raqibuddin Ahmed, posted at Garden Reach (borough XV), died of coronavirus on Saturday, taking the civic bodyâs Covid toll to six in the past two months. Among the six civic bodyâs employees, who succumbed to the virus, four were frontline workers associated with its Covid- combat team. Ahmed was the second KMC medical professional in the Garden Reach area to have died of the virus in the past 10 days. On August 21, the virus had claimed the life of Dibakar Das, a medical official posted at the KMCâs ward clinic in Garden Reach. âAfter the death of two key persons in the borough health department at Garden Reach in such a short time, some of our health department employees working as the frontline medical professionals against the virus are scared. Now, we need to arrange tests or any kind of medical relief, including hospitalization for those who may fall sick,â said a senior KMC health department official. Sources in the KMC health department said Ahmed (62) had been coordinating with the civic bodyâs Covid-response team in Garden Reach-Metiabruz belt that has seen multiple positive cases and several deaths in the past two and a half months. âHe was a dedicated medical professional whom we saw working tirelessly for the patients living in the Garden Reach-Metiabruz belt in times of need without fearing for his life,â said a KMC medical officer. The civic body needs to depute a senior official to coordinate with the Covid-response team and local police in the Garden Reach-Metiabruz belt, a corona-sensitive zone. "
"BENGALURU: With 81 Covid-19 testing laboratories, which constitute about 10% of the total labs in the country (793), Karnataka should have effortlessly conducted about 31,000 tests per day. But itâs hardly reached half that capacity. The data suggest a huge backlog of samples in laboratories, especially those run by the government. Officials say though there are 81 labs in the state â 44 government-run and 37 private-owned â only 57 were functional as on Tuesday. The others are closed for reasons like lack of equipment and staff testing positive. These labs have a collective testing capacity of 31,116 samples a day, but the highest mark they have touched is only 18,307 (on July 3). With the labs failing to perform to their full potential, 10,830 samples were pending as on Monday (July 6). The backlog has hit the efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state. Experts attribute the chaotic scenario to procedural hassles and red tape. When the government last month asked private hospitals and medical colleges to conduct Covid tests, only a few were equipped with BSL-2 (biosafety levels), a must to test viral infections like Covid-19. While most of them were designed for simple tests with National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) approval, they had to either recalibrate their equipment or purchase new ones and obtain regulatory clearances from agencies such as ICMR before conducting Covid tests. âWhen almost all private medical colleges are ready with equipment and the required infrastructure, the agencies are taking their own time to grant approvals. Also, procurement of equipment has been difficult since most of the vendors are Mumbai-based from where movement of goods and personnel has been hindered,â said S Kumar, chancellor of Devaraj Urs University that runs Devaraj urs Medical College in Kolar. He pointed out that his college had applied for ICMR approval for its Covid-19 lab three weeks ago and the nod came only a couple of days back. The lab is now conducting 60 tests a day. âAccording to government records, our capacity is 200 tests a day, but we require time to reach that level,â Kumar added. S Sacchidanand, vicechancellor of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, said 40 out of 60 private medical colleges have set up the laboratories with the required approval and the rest will follow soon. âThe government is aware of the constraints and doing its best to support the medical colleges,â he added. âA few labs overburdenedâDr R Ravindra, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said in the absence of a centralised system to monitor the performance of Covid labs, the workload distribution is uneven.âWhile a few labs are being overburdened, many are idle with no samples reaching them,â he added.

"Ludhiana: After she tested negative for Covid-19 twice, Jodhewal police station SHO sub-inspector Arshpreet Kaur Grewal was discharged from DMCH on Friday. Flower petals were first showered on her in the hospital by her colleagues and then in her area of residence by her neighbours, who also presented her a siropa (a robe of honour). While speaking with the TOI, Arshpreet, 27, said, âAfter contracting Covid-19, I was under treatment for 21 days. These 21 days were life changing. I often talked to myself and realized the importance of small things, like watching sky and stars, as I was not even allowed to open my room window. I had time to introspect and retrospect. I recalled my job days, mistakes and made some plans for the future.â Arshpreet was admitted to the hospital on April 17, after she tested positive. She was a contact of ACP-north Anil Kohli.  âI was disheartened when my second report, too, was positive. But my colleagues, friends and family kept me motivated. ACP Rupinder Bhatti would call me at least thrice a day to inspirit me. The doctors and nurses, too, were supportive. In third and fourth tests, I was negative,â she added. About the 21-day quarantine, she said, âI have never been so free in my live. There was plenty of âme timeââ¦ I did yoga and read books. I have now realised that life is very uncertain and we should make the most of it. I missed my father hugging me and the food and tea my mother prepared. When I was getting discharged, I wanted to meet my father first. When I stepped out of the hospital, my colleagues gave me a floral welcome. I was overjoyed on seeing my father. After a tight hug, we left for home,â she said. In Sarabha Nagarâs Police Colony, her neighbours greeted her, and ASI Davinder Kumar presented her a siropa. On reaching home, she first had tea made by her mother. âNow she is cooking my favourite food for lunch. I have been prescribed 14-day home quarantine, after which I will join duty with same zeal and enthusiasm. I miss wearing uniform. I know ACP Anil Kohli and I got infected at vegetable market. It is disheartening that we have lost him. But I am ready to be on duty at the vegetable market again. I have defeated corona and it does not scare me anymore,â she said. "

"Ahmedabad: On Friday, Sabarmati jail authorities denied claims buzzing on social media that Covid-19 is spreading across the prison. The authorities said that as part of their plan to halt corona infections, they have released 794 prisoners since the lockdown was imposed in March. These prisoners faced jail terms of less than seven years. They have been released on interim bail or on parole. Before the lockdown, the jail housed 3,100 prisoners.

"The Corona pandemic has been one of the trending topics of discussion for the last many months now. So, just like Durga Pujas, a number of Kali Pujas in the city too have decorated their pandals on corona themes.  Narayantala Yubak Sangha, which is celebrating its 57th year, has dedicated their Puja to the frontline warriors. Doctors, police personnel and nurses are being depicted in their Puja with life-size statues of police and doctors. Monojit Mondal, one of the senior members, said âWithout these people, the entire human civilization would not have stood a chance against the pandemic. The doctors and nurses are working for common people without even thinking about their lives. This is a gesture of respect to all those frontline warriors.â Barisha Shanti Sangha Club has also decorated their Puja on a similar theme that also exudes hope for a better future. âThe entire world is going through a rough patch and I am sure things will be different soon. Just like the cycle of life and death, human civilization will have a bright future too,â said Gourab Sengupta, a club member.

In the coming future, we should not forget this,â said Santu Das, a club member. "
"MUMBAI: Despite a steady decline in new Covid-19 patients, the case fatality rate (CFR) appears to be climbing in the state. An analysis of cases and deaths shows the stateâs CFR has been steadily increasing from mid-September, even though active cases have declined 34%. A CFR of 1.8% recorded in the first fortnight of September rose to almost 2.2% in the last two weeks of the month. The increase continued in the first two weeks of October when the CFR reached 2.5%. A study of the deaths in absolute numbers, too, shows a three- to five-fold increase in Covid deaths in several districts. Numbers from the stateâs daily update reveals the tribal-populated districts such as Gadchiroli and Chandrapur have added deaths in huge volumes in the past 30 days. In Gadchiroli, for instance, Covid deaths spiked from two to 25 between September 15 and October 15. Similarly, in Chandrapur, they jumped from 62 to 203 in the same period. Districts such as Gondia and Bhandara, too, have seen a three-fold rise in deaths. Wardha that was hit by Covid much later than other districts saw its deaths spiral from 26 to 135 in the past one month. Districts in western Maharashtra and Konkan such as Satara and Sindhudurg, too, have seen a rise in deaths. Deaths in Satara, for example, increased from 607 to 1,329 between September 15 and October 15. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said while the increase in death figures was being reflected in the state numbers, a large part of it was due to data update. âSeveral districts have reported deaths which they hadnât done in the last few months. That has pushed the death numbers to some extent,â he said, adding the stateâs current cumulative CFR was 2.6% and daily deaths are no longer in the range of 300-400. Dr Anil Rudey, civil surgeon of Gadchiroli, said they had quite a few critical cases showing up at the last minute. âThese patients, including many from neighbouring districts, had progressed to bilateral pneumonia and came gasping,â he said. On a more worrying note, the doctor said there have been at least two cases where critical patients were sent back from government medical colleges of Chandrapur and Nagpur, saying they had no beds. âOne of them was a cancer patient who eventually died in a hospital here,â he said. Dr Raj Gehlot, district health officer of Chandrapur, said while there was a spurt in deaths in the past one month, the districtâs mortality is less than 1.5%. In an analysis of 187 deaths, they found around 45 (24%) people died within 24 hours and 29 (16%) within 48 hours of hospitalization. A senior doctor from Dhule said oxygen availability and administration were still an issue in smaller set-ups and require closer attention. "

"Jaipur: Hospitals in divisional headquarters providing Covid-19 treatment are receiving patients from districts in increased numbers after being referred by dedicated Covid-19 hospitals from districts making them more crowded. Taking note of it, the health department has issued strict orders to doctors in districts not to refer Covid-19 patients to higher centres at divisional headquarters âunnecessarilyâ. At divisional headquarters, the hospitals run by the government and private players are witnessing arrival of patients from districts. A senior health department official said that the health department has directed doctors and officials in districts to treat corona patients in their dedicated Covid-19 hospitals that have all the facilities for treating patients with mild to severe symptoms. The order stated that it has been seen that the districtâs dedicated Covid hospitals are referring patients to centres at division level, even though they have facilities for treatment of mild, moderate and severe symptom patients, which unnecessarily put pressure on dedicated Covid hospitals at division level. All dedicated Covid hosptials in the districts have been directed to provide treatment as per the protocol and not unnecessarily refer patients to higher centres. "

"JAIPUR: Expressing concern over the quality of antigen test kits being used across the country to diagnose Covid, the state government has asked the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to follow up with companies involved in manufacture of the kits and direct them to improve its quality. Health department principal secretary Akhil Arora wrote to Balram Bhargava, secretary to the department of health research, ministry of health and director general, ICMR, requesting that the testing strategy be reviewed. He mentioned that they had validated rapid antigen test kits through the department of microbiology, SMS Medical College, and found that the sensitivity of rapid antigen test taking RT-PCR as gold standard was 48.6% for Covid and only 33% for influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases. Arora stressed upon the need for reviewing the testing strategy referring to the ICMRâs advisory issued on June 14 on use of rapid antigen detection test and also the advisory issued on June 23 on newer additional strategies for Covid testing wherein ICMR had recommended the use of rapid point-of-care (PoC) antigen detection test (for diagnosis along with RT-PCR), while communicating that specificity of the test ranged from 99.3 to 100% and sensitivity of thee test ranged from 50.6% to 84%. However, during validation, the sensitivity was found much less at SMS Medical College. âWith this low sensitivity, the stateâs technical committee has rightly advised against the use of rapid antigen test at large or in hospital settings. In case of asymptomatic cases who are negative with rapid antigen test in a hospital setting, there is risk of transmission of infection through them to other patients and to healthcare services providers. In case of symptomatic cases who are negative with rapid antigen test in a hospital setting, they will have to be subjected to a confirmatory RT-PCR test, which implies increase of time for testing, and also another test,â Arora wrote.

"PATNA: Bidding final farewell to the loved ones has always been a difficult task and in case of death of a Covid-19 positive person, family members do not even get the opportunity to say goodbye or plant a last kiss on the forehead. A retired school teacher, Bina Prasad, 68, could not even see her husband and elder son for the last time, both of whom died at two different hospitals after being infected with coronavirus. Resident of Khagaul, Bina talks about the pain she is going through. ""My elder son Sanjay Kumar and my husband Ram Kumar Prasad were admitted in a private hospital near Saguna More where my son died on August 6 leaving behind his seven month old child. My husband was then shifted to AIIMS-Patna on August 8 and within a few minutes he died there,"" said Bina, adding, ""I got to know about my husband's death five days later."" As Bina had also tested positive for Covid-19, she was admitted to another hospital on Bypass road. She said, ""I was taken to the hospital on August 9, the day when my husband's last ritual was carried out at Bans Ghat. I was not even aware that when I will return home after recovering, I will not not be able to see two family members, both closest to my heart."" Though two other family members who had tested positive for coronavirus have recovered, it is the loss of dear ones which is still haunting them. She said several of her close relatives could not come to console them. ""But the situation is such that we can not judge who is with us and who is not. Earlier, during death or any happy moment, all relatives used to gather together, but this pandemic has changed everything, even the way we do last rituals,"" added Bina. Even 45 year old Krishna Nagar resident Siva Upadhyaya had a similar tale of loneliness. Her husband Upendra Upadhyaya died on July 29 early morning at AIIMS-Patna. Shiva said the deceased's two brothers were the only ones who went to Bans Ghat for final rituals and that too they were standing far away maintaining all protocols. Even Phulwarishahrif resident Nazma Khatoon (name changed) who died in August first week was directly taken to the graveyard from the hospital. As family members were quarantined, one relative went to the graveyard to see the final ritual and offered prayers. ""Her family members wanted to have her last glimpse, but were not permitted as they were in home quarantine,"" said her neighbour. AIIMS-Patna Covid-19 nodal incharge Dr Sanjeev Kumar recalled two incidents of July 30, in which male partners died while female partners were discharged the same day after recovering. He further said the dead body is wrapped following protocols and sent directly to crematorium or graveyard, and not at home. ""Such has never happened earlier. Now only one family member is called to identify the deceased and the body is carried in the vehicle provided by administration,"" added Dr Sanjeev. Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi said though earlier people expressed desire to take the dead body home, they agreed after being explained from the administration. Ravi said families of such deceased are emotionally distressed. "
"NEW DELHI: Delhi government has launched âJeevan Seva appâ to help Covid patients and their families commute to hospitals and healthcare facilities in the city. The app, launched in collaboration with a private agency, will use electric vehicles as an ambulance to transfer non-critical cases to healthcare facilities within Delhi free of cost. The patients can download the app through the link, which will be sent through SMS and QR code to every Covid positive patient. Health minister Satyendar Jain, who launched the mobile application, said it had been unveiled with the objective to facilitate Delhi citizens in home isolation in case of need. âFrom health checkups, ambulance requirements to admission in hospitals, health amenities are now just a click away. With this app, patients will get access to an e-vehicle, which will provide for free pickup and drop services. Each vehicle will be properly sanitised after every ride,â Jain said. Patients can book a cab from the app after registering through OTP, by entering their pickup and drop locations. The nearest cab will automatically be dispatched to serve. The service will be available 24 hours. The drivers will get all the information on their app. They will reach the patients sooner as the pickup location is automatically captured by the app. Dedicated supervisors will be monitoring the situation round the clock. The trained drivers will be complying with new safety guidelines, such as wearing PPE kits and being well equipped with sanitisers. The cabin will be insulated as well. The app will add efficiency to Delhiâs emergency commute services enabling ambulances to be more available to cater to serious requests in time. The patient will be apprised of pickup time and can contact the driver through the app only, reducing the anxiety regarding the availability and reaching of the cab ambulance. "

"Nagpur: Just as âwashing handsâ is now second nature to majority of children due to Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry of education (MOE) wants to mainstream similar ideas to help after school reopening. In partnership with Unicef, MOE has released a series of informational, educational and communication (IEC) materials to develop Corona Responsive Behaviour (CRB). In a letter to state education secretaries, MOE officials said developing CRB among schoolchildren is crucial to keep them safe. LS Changsan, joint secretary (Institutions), wrote, âTill now, non-opening of schools has kept children safe. However, opening of schools, which is inevitable, if not carefully nurtured in terms of a new code of conduct and rigorous protocol, could reverse all gains that the governmentâs calibrated handling of Covid-19 has so far yielded.â For this, IEC in the form of posters, wall paintings, animation film for gram panchayats and social media creatives are being provided to all states. Changsanâs letter to education secretaries went on to say, âI would like to request you to disseminate the IEC materials among teachers, staff and students and also make arrangements for proper display of the posters and paintings in schools.â The messages in IEC material focus on telling children that in Covid-19 times they must not share food, water etc with their peers. Also, schoolchildren are being urged to resort to ânamasteâ while greeting friends as an added precaution. In Maharashtra, schools and junior colleges have been given permission to reopen after November 23. This will however apply only to Std IX-XII and children can attend school only after parentsâ written consent. Though online classes will continue, those attending offline will have to take extra precautions. SOPs for school reopening had been issued a few months ago by the state, and it seems that not much will change in that. "
